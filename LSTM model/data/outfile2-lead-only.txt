<p> As 1991 was drawing to a close, Mariya Y. Vrublevskaya went out shopping in a faint snow for a pine tree so she and her two young granddaughters could decorate a traditional yolka to cheer up their spare New Year's celebrations. </p> <p> What the 62-year-old retired factory worker discovered was that the trees, like everything else connected with this eerie holiday, had soared in price, costing 10 times more than last year and way beyond the means of grandmothers trying to bring up two girls on a combined pension and part-time pay of 250 rubles a month. </p> <p> The first expressions of angry protest were reported today among the battered consumers of Russia as they tried to cope with drastically rising food prices. </p> <p> The incidents seemed more the exception than the rule thus far, as Russia and its neighbors adjusted warily but peacefully to the unpredictable situation. Price controls on most basic goods were ended last week in the hope of engendering free-market forces of supply and demand, but the effects thus far have proved uncertain at best. </p> <p> Russians will wake up on Thursday with the cost of their no-frills existence suddenly far, far higher. Their reactions to that fact will determine the success or failure of what amounts to a huge and fateful gamble by President Boris N. Yeltsin. </p> <p> The long-anticipated "price liberalization" after years of artificially low fixed prices will let manufacturers, regional authorities and retailers set the prices of consumer goods and most food products. The Government will continue to set ceilings on basic food and fuels, but even those will be three to five times higher. </p> <p> Boris N. Yeltsin toured the docks and empty stores of St. Petersburg today in his campaign to maintain the patience of a people sorely tested by soaring prices and unrelenting shortages. </p> <p> Drawing instant and divided crowds wherever he stopped, the Russian President issued the same mix of stern threats, appeals for initiative and promises of sausages to come that he had carried to Bryansk and other cities around Russia. </p> <p> As the United States and other Western nations get ready to send large amounts of aid to the former Soviet Union, people here are struggling to overcome inexperience and disorganization at both ends of the pipeline, as well as a strong temptation to divert scarce food, clothing and medicine to a hungry black market. </p> <p> Rushing to stitch together some kind of safety net for the needy and to keep up with the foreign response to their country's growing emergency, Russian Government officials have created a Ministry for Social Protection. </p> <p> With the harsh fact of price rises sinking in across the nation, the Speaker of the Russian Parliament called today for the resignation of the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin for having enacted "uncontrolled, anarchic" economic reforms. </p> <p> The call by the Speaker, Ruslan Khasbulatov, was quickly rejected by a spokesman for the Russian Government, which denied as well that Mr. Yeltsin might resign his second job as Prime Minister in reaction to the growing political protest over price rises. Mr. Khasbulatov is a popular politician who had made it clear lately that he was breaking away from Mr. Yeltsin. </p> <p> The line to buy a piece of the action in the People's Oil Industrial Investment Euro-Asian Corporation, with its unlikely sales office in an empty hall of the Museum of the History of Moscow, is a good measure of Russians' growing panic about the vanishing value of the ruble. </p> <p> "Here we are taking a risk, of course," said Nikolai Khanchenkov, a 41-year-old scientific researcher, as he stood on the museum's drafty stairwell recently. He was waiting his turn to plunk down 1,000 rubles, roughly $10 at the current exchange rate, for a share in the brand-new company. "On the other hand, if we hold on to our money, we will certainly lose it," he said. "It is that simple." Snow Stays, Money Goes </p> <p> With inflation running at an estimated annual rate of 300 percent, Russians are at a loss to know what to do with their savings. Some money is being siphoned off to pay for the recent big jump in food prices, but with faith in the future at a low point, many people now prefer to eat less and put their rubles into something more durable. </p> <p> The Bush Administration, in a policy switch aimed at more quickly assisting the economic transformation of Russia and five other former Soviet republics, urged today that they be admitted to full membership in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. </p> <p> Membership in the fund and the World Bank for Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia -- the former republics with which the United States is initially establishing diplomatic relations -- could allow them access to billions of dollars in development loans to help make the unsettling transition from a centralized to a free-market economy. </p> <p> Under attack from all sides for policies that have let prices soar, the Russian Government won reluctant approval today for the next phase of its painful economic reforms: a budget that it says is virtually deficit-free but calls for deep spending cuts and higher taxes. </p> <p> As Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, the architect of the reforms, explained to Parliament today, a balanced budget and a tight monetary policy are necessary if Russia is to keep hyperinflation at bay and pull itself toward a market economy. </p> <p> The 47-nation conference on coordinating aid to the former Soviet Union opens at the State Department on Wednesday, with a host of tensions between the United States and its allies bubbling just beneath the surface over how best to help Russia and the other republics, officials and experts involved say. </p> <p> At issue are both clashing egos and clashing policies. Many European officials, who were not consulted about the conference before it was announced, say they resent the leadership role being taken by the United States, which some of them argue is an effort to disguise how little Washington is actually doing. No longer feeling the need for Washington's security umbrella after the demise of the Soviet Union, the Europeans are increasingly speaking their mind. </p> <p> Few bread stores anywhere are as well-equipped as the Australia Shop on Piatnitskaya Street in downtown Moscow. Automated equipment, a recent gift from Australia, mixes dough and bakes bread 18 hours a day, and as fresh loaves come out of the stainless-steel ovens, they are stacked in wire-mesh trays, waiting to be sold. But despite this abundance, anxious customers form a line half a block long outside the shop. </p> <p> Lines like these, televised abroad, give the impression of a bread shortage in Moscow, an impression that by all accounts is erroneous. Bread sales have risen to record levels in recent months, as people substitute bread for meat, cheese, milk and eggs, all of which have grown much too expensive for many consumers. </p> <p> Fearful that suppliers would divert their goods across the border to Russia, the governments of Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova went along with President Boris N. Yeltsin's sweeping liberalization of consumer prices today. </p> <p> Ukraine, which had reluctantly planned to raise prices one week after Russia, at the last minute decided to free prices today. Moldova and Belarus followed suit with price increases of their own. </p> <p> So far, the radical changes in Moscow have brought little more than added confusion and debt to the Suvorov Collective Farm. But the frozen soil has not exhausted its powers: in one hut, a villager celebrates the first publication of his verse. </p> <p> It is the heart of winter, and from the road Koltsovo looks at rest. Wisps of wood smoke curl from log houses haphazardly scattered on the white hillsides, calves bellow from a warm and pungent barn, and even the rusting equipment seems less desolate now, half-buried in the snow. </p> <p> Russia and at least half a dozen other former Soviet republics will most likely join the International Monetary Fund at the group's spring meeting in Washington on April 27, executives at the fund and foreign officials said today. </p> <p> The officials said the Group of Seven nations and the I.M.F.'s 156 members were still debating how large a share of the bank's capital the republics should supply. </p> <p> Bush Administration officials said today that the meeting between President Bush and the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, on Saturday had put ties between their nations "on a new plane" and had set the stage for a visit to Moscow this month by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. </p> <p> At the same time, they expressed some confusion over biting remarks about foreign support for Russia that Mr. Yeltsin made Saturday evening in Canada, only hours after completing talks with Mr. Bush at Camp David. </p> <p> Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi of Russia, bolstering his image as a superpatriot and a vigorous opponent of economic reforms, appeared today before a congress of about 3,000 nationalists and warned that the Russian people were headed for "economic genocide" under the course chosen by the Government and its Western advisers. </p> <p> In a speech laden with references to Russia's glorious past and what he views as its current incompetence, Mr. Rutskoi positioned himself to take advantage of despair over soaring prices and the hurt pride that many feel over Russia's loss of status. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia challenged and charmed New York's business leaders on Friday night with such a forceful sales pitch for his country that some said later they were more likely to consider ventures in Russia than before. </p> <p> Guests at a dinner for Mr. Yeltsin at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said the Russian leader scribbled notes furiously throughout the meal, and was disarmingly frank about his own ignorance of the fine points of capitalism. </p> <p> It began as a low whisper among aides to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. But as the plane taking them to Moscow at the close of Mr. Baker's grueling tour of former Soviet republics took off, the whispers grew into a vigorous chant: "Penta, Penta, Penta, Penta." </p> <p> The Penta is the deluxe German-run hotel in Moscow where Mr. Baker always stays. After a week of sleeping often two or three to a room in seedy, run-down former Communist Party guest houses in the wilds of Ashkhabad and Dushanbe, Mr. Baker's aides were desperate for the down comforters, hot water and efficiency of the Penta. It was the first time any of them could recall longing to get to Moscow. </p> <p> Leading news publications, including some that helped bring down the Soviet dictatorship, are being forced to curtail operations because of skyrocketing printing costs under free-market reforms now being championed philosophically in newspapers. </p> <p> Muscovites today could not find their daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, which went to alternate-day publication this week because of newsprint costs that have jumped from 300 rubles per ton of paper to 13,000 rubles in the last year. With more than 20 million readers, the newspaper is one of the world's largest. </p> <p> Beneath the veneer of competence, the Bush Administration's strategy toward the former Soviet Union is a dangerously ineffective response to the greatest democratic awakening and market-opening opportunity of the 20th century. Just as Americans recognize how the Administration has mismanaged the economy, they must now comprehend how its hesitant foreign policy jeopardizes our national security and economic interests. </p> <p> Boris Yeltsin recently told Congressional leaders that Russia is "in a fight for survival" and had only three months to turn things around. Without more international aid, he said, there would be "an explosion." </p> <p> In a memo circulated privately to his worshipers but meant to bludgeon President Bush publicly, Richard Nixon lays down this warning: If the U.S. doesn't get its act together to save Boris Yeltsin, the question of "Who lost Russia?" will be even more politically devastating in the 90's than "Who lost China?" was in the 50's. </p> <p> I've got three quarrels with the Old Trickster's latest endeavor to help humankind: </p> <p> Proclaiming a state is the easy part. The tricky part, Ukraine is learning, is building one. </p> <p> One hundred days into independence, the nation is deeply divided over what to do next. Economic reforms are stalled. Friction with Russia is growing. The ersatz national currency has dropped in value from 10 rubles to 1 coupon to parity with the ruble as early illusions about the powers of an independent currency have waned. </p> <p> Eight weeks into Russia's gamble with economic reform, after prices skyrocketed on everything from kindergartens to airplane tickets, from beef to bricks, most people have learned to cope with the Government's economic "shock therapy" in ways that surprise even them, not to mention the Government and its critics. </p> <p> It is still too early to judge the success or failure of President Boris N. Yeltsin's policy of crash capitalism. Besides, as the population is reminded almost daily, the worst is probably yet to come. Since Jan. 2, when the price changes went into effect, production in industry and agriculture has dropped sharply across Russia, raising the specter of unemployment and new shortages. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin vigorously defended his Government and economic reforms today before a skeptical Congress of People's Deputies and warned the lawmakers not to short-circuit Russia's transformation by diluting presidential power. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin and his chief economic adviser, Yegor T. Gaidar, gave strongly worded speeches that acknowledged some failures in policy and performance, but said the economy was improving and would stabilize by the end of the year. </p> <p> When President Boris N. Yeltsin locks horns with the jealous Russian Congress of People's Deputies next week, the likelihood is that he will prevail. The question is at what price. </p> <p> The main issues before the 1,000-odd deputies, whose Congress is the highest legislative authority in Russia, will be the progress of economic change, the powers of the government and a new constitution. </p> <p> Russia's Cabinet withdrew its resignation today after the Congress of Peoples' Deputies passed a muted declaration of support for the course of radical economic reform. </p> <p> The declaration did not formally undo the resolution approved last Saturday that prompted the resignation in the first place, and a rushed vote left many lawmakers confused about what they were adopting. </p> <p> After heated and tangled debate, the Russian Congress of People's Deputies passed a resolution this evening that could curtail some of the powers of President Boris N. Yeltsin. </p> <p> The Congress voted for an amendment that would require Mr. Yeltsin to give up his concurrent post as Prime Minister within 90 days, and to nominate a new Prime Minister subject to parliamentary approval. </p> <p> The International Monetary Fund said today that it had endorsed Russia's economic reform plan, paving the way for Moscow to receive up to $4 billion in I.M.F. aid over the next year. </p> <p> I.M.F. officials say Russia could begin receiving loans from the fund as early as May, a move that will place the Russian economy to some extent under the stewardship of the I.M.F. It will still require Moscow to meet certain conditions to qualify for the aid, including stringent targets to control the inflation rate and budget deficit. </p> <p> On the eve of an important session of the Russian Parliament, President Boris N. Yeltsin demanded strong executive authority in a new constitution today and promised to introduce measures to soften the immediate effects of his economic reforms. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin broke days of public silence, during which he has maneuvered to blunt expected criticism from the Parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies, by shifting some of his closest allies from their posts while defending the need for market reforms and for a strong hand at the top. </p> <p> As Russia's top economic official met with them for the first time, finance ministers from the seven largest industrial nations today called on the Russian Government to continue moving boldly ahead with economic reforms. </p> <p> A day before the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are expected to announce that they have voted to welcome Russia and the other former Soviet republics as members, the ministers pressed the Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Yegor T. Gaidar, for assurances that Moscow would not backtrack on economic reforms under a hostile Parliament's pressure. </p> <p> The Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin and the Russian Parliament drew back today from a conflict that had threatened Mr. Yeltsin's program of economic reform. </p> <p> The confrontation, watched anxiously by the West, was tentatively defused when the Congress of People's Deputies adopted "in principle" a declaration of support for economic reform. The compromise measure, prepared by Government officials and congressional leaders, effectively neutralized the most contentious provisions of a resolution the Congress of deputies adopted on Saturday. Brady Sees 'Steps Backward' </p> <p> That resolution had prompted Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, the chief architect of the Government's radical reform program, to lead the Cabinet in offering its collective resignation. In a statement made public on Monday, the ministers declared that the Congress's decision would inevitably lead to "a catastrophic decline in living standards, famine, social upheavals and chaos." </p> <p> After nearly 75 years of deliberate isolation, Russia is expected to rejoin the world economy next week, when it should be formally accepted as a member of the International Monetary Fund. This is occurring at a critical time for President Boris N. Yeltsin, who must make some politically difficult decisions to keep his vaunted economic reform moving. </p> <p> Without these decisions -- primarily to restructure the bulky industrial economy and thereby bring about the inevitable displacement of thousands of workers -- the reform could fail to go far enough to get the billions of dollars of aid being prepared by the I.M.F. and Western nations. Russian leaders know that to receive the much needed Western aid, they will have to submit to I.M.F. discipline and tighten the collective economic belt ever tighter. Credit Is Expanded </p> <p> But already some serious signs of slippage have occurred in Mr. Yeltsin's program of economic reform. Aware that the sudden rise of prices without a similar rise in income has led to widespread grumbling, the Russian Government in recent weeks has begun to loosen up on its tight-money policy. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin's crash program of economic reform took a drubbing today from critics in the Congress of People's Deputies, with one lawmaker comparing the Yeltsin Government to a Greek in the fourth century B.C. who burned down a temple to make his name immortal. </p> <p> "Our Government will go down in history all right, as the Herostratos who finally wrecked the economy of a great country," said Mikhail Chelnakov, one in a string of legislators who lined up to deliver their verdicts on the four-month-old program. </p> <p> The Russian aid package announced last week by the Bush Administration and some Western allies is less concrete and less complete than many officials made it seem, interviews with Administration officials, American lawmakers and senior officials in Europe, Japan and Canada indicate. </p> <p> The officials said eagerness to show support for President Boris N. Yeltsin before his crucial encounter with the Russian Parliament this week accounted for the hasty announcement. </p> <p> Seeking billions of dollars to heal its economic ills, Russia presented a smooth young face to the West today, a 36-year-old Deputy Prime Minister full of enthusiasm for free markets. </p> <p> In his gray suit, light blue shirt and dark tie, Yegor T. Gaidar could have passed for a bureaucrat of any Western European government. With his unwrinkled cheeks and detailed descriptions of how to sell state-owned industries, he offered a clear-cut contrast to his boss, President Boris N. Yeltsin, a rough and bluff politician of an age to be his father. </p> <p> The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank formally offered membership today to Russia, Ukraine and most of the other former Soviet republics. It was a major step to tie the republics into the rest of the world's economy. </p> <p> Western and Russian officials said offering membership would also help make billions of dollars of Monetary Fund and World Bank aid available to the republics as they emerge from seven decades of Communism and make the painful transition to market economies. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin's entire Cabinet formally offered to resign today unless an unexpectedly aggressive Parliament halted efforts to scale back the Government's program of economic reform. </p> <p> Any such dilution of the Russian President's program could lead the West to reconsider its offer of billions of dollars in assistance and jeopardize Mr. Yeltsin's plans for economic recovery. </p> <p> Yegor T. Gaidar, the Deputy Prime Minister and chief architect of the economic reforms, said the Cabinet had submitted its resignation en masse, reflecting a growing power struggle between Mr. Yeltsin and the Congress of People's Deputies, the highest legislative authority in Russia.  Keep Working, Yeltsin Says </p> <p> Mr. Gaidar said Mr. Yeltsin had asked his ministers to continue working until the end of the Congress session in the next few days, when he will decide whether to accept their resignations. </p> <p> Their action was in protest against a resolution adopted by the Congress on Saturday ordering Mr. Yeltsin to relinquish the post of Prime Minister and to name a new Government within three months, as well as to make broad changes in the economic program, which came under sharp criticism. </p> <p> The International Monetary Fund complimented the Ukrainian Government today for "its stated commitment to a market economy," but the fund's statement fell short of the endorsement it issued last week of Russia's fast-paced reform program. </p> <p> Over the past week, the I.M.F.'s executive board has been reviewing the economic liberalization programs of the former Soviet republics in preparation for their joining the fund around the time of its meeting on April 27. </p> <p> The Russian Government's moves to slacken its tough economic reforms and hints by free-market advocates that they might resign could delay the flow of Western aid to Russia and the creation of a ruble stabilization fund, economists say. </p> <p> The $24 billion aid package announced by President Bush just before the current meeting of the Congress of People's Deputies in Moscow was intended to help President Boris N. Yeltsin press ahead with changes, but his backtracking last week, caused largely by pressures from the hostile legislature, could delay important pieces of the package. </p> <p> Russian Government and congress officials spent the day today in secretive huddles, seeking ways to retreat from the confrontation that took shape on Saturday when the country's highest elected council adopted a resolution limiting President Boris N. Yeltsin's right to name his officials. </p> <p> After a meeting between senior members of Mr. Yeltsin's Government and the Presidium of the Congress of People's Deputies, the two sides said in a statement that "as a result of constructive discussions, it became possible to narrow the positions and to agree on cooperation in advancing radical economic reform." </p> <p> In his five days of meetings here, Yegor T. Gaidar, Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister, sketched a sweeping yet detailed vision of Russia's economic future, including plans to make the ruble convertible by July 1 and to speed up privatization. </p> <p> Mr. Gaidar, who is chief architect of Russia's economic reforms, said he would put an emphasis on increasing oil and agricultural production. </p> <p> Every morning about 10, Lyuda Averyanova takes up her spot in the middle of the crush on Stoleshnikov Lane, now the hottest street bazaar in a city seized by consumer frenzy, and starts selling bottles of German blond hair dye. </p> <p> To her right, a woman sells Russian-made sweat suits for 500 rubles; to the left, other women offer Christian Dior moisturizer for 1,000 rubles and Spanish faucets for 3,500 rubles. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia signed a resolution today raising the prices for oil and gas more than fivefold, a long-awaited move that is expected to send new shock waves through the fragile Russian economy. </p> <p> Although wholesale prices for oil and natural gas will remain low by world standards, many economists fear that the increases will batter the nation's farms, factories and transportation. The price of oil is rising from 48 cents to between $2.47 and $3.01 a barrel, compared with about $20 on world markets. </p> <p> SCIENTISTS at Russia's five stations in Antarctica say they have stopped sending data home to protest the difficulties their families face in Russia. </p> <p> In a statement signed by Dr. Vladimir Nazarov, leader of the Vostok station, the Russians cited their nation's severe inflation and said: "The miserable salary of Russian polar explorers, working in the rigorous climate of Antarctica, is hardly enough for our families even to buy food. We cannot help them. We can only send moral support by telephone." </p> <p> It is a year now since Boris N. Yeltsin became the first elected President of Russia, and the reviews are as diverse as the extraordinary chain of events that transformed him from the maverick leader of a Soviet republic to the master of the Kremlin. </p> <p> Though he travels widely and gives frequent interviews, the burly, 61-year-old President remains a complex and elusive figure. He is still enormously popular at home, but abroad his stiff and formal demeanor have denied him the celebrity status enjoyed by his archrival, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  In Wake of Gorbachev </p> <p> That contrast is certain to hang over Mr. Yeltsin's visit to the United States starting Monday, which comes in the wake of Mr. Gorbachev's successful voyage. The trip is Mr. Yeltsin's second to the United States as Russia's President and his first full-dress summit meeting, and he will have the rare honor of addressing a joint meeting of Congress. </p> <p> Although the biggest news out of this week's summit meeting was the agreement to sharply reduce American and Russian nuclear arsenals, the centerpiece turned out to be economic relations between the two former rivals. </p> <p> In effect, these two days marked the moment when the currency of American-Russian relations shifted from warheads to dollars. Stripped to its essence, what President Boris N. Yeltsin did this week was promise Mr. Bush that Russia would trash thousands of warheads in exchange for long-promised trade privileges, a bilateral investment treaty, removal of cold-war trade barriers and the hope of lucrative American investment and quick Congressional approval of a Russian aid package. </p> <p> On a day that the United States gave Russia a set of trade incentives to boost its struggling economy, President Boris N. Yeltsin swept through official Washington like a conquering hero today and announced that he was deactivating the most potent nuclear missiles aimed at America. </p> <p> Amid chants of "Boris, Boris, Boris!" reverberating through the House of Representatives chamber, Mr. Yeltsin stirred Congress to 13 standing ovations as he vowed that the "idol of Communism" had "collapsed, never to rise again."  [ Excerpts, page A18. ] </p> <p> A decision by Russia to pay Government workers by printing more money, coupled with a shuffling of ministers, has brought sharp domestic questioning about President Boris N. Yeltsin's commitment to austerity measures in the transition to a market economy. </p> <p> The recent Russian moves have also generated concerns at the International Monetary Fund, according to international monetary officials. They said that an I.M.F. team had just returned to the fund's headquarters in Washington from a visit to Moscow and was evaluating the latest Yeltsin Government actions. </p> <p> In a move to speed aid to Moscow, the International Monetary Fund plans to lend the Russians $1 billion to help pay for crucial imports in a simplified reform agreement that the agency hopes to complete in the next two weeks. </p> <p> The I.M.F.'s plan, as described by its officials, represented a scaling back of original plans for a multibillion-dollar package requiring more sweeping reforms by the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin. </p> <p> Administration officials said today that they would press President Boris N. Yeltsin to bring Russia's budget deficit under control to help enable Moscow to sign an economic reform agreement with the International Monetary Fund. </p> <p> If Russia controls its deficit, reins in its money supply and moves to make the ruble convertible, then the Administration will press the I.M.F. not to delay an agreement because of concerns about details, the officials added. </p> <p> Eleven nations of the Balkan Peninsula and the former Soviet Union joined today in a group for economic cooperation. </p> <p> In a solemn ceremony, Presidents Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine, Eduard A. Shevardnadze of Georgia and Prime Ministers Suleyman Demirel of Turkey and Constantine Mitsotakis of Greece signed the Declaration of Black Sea Economic Cooperation. </p> <p> The introduction of a tough troika of former Soviet industrial managers into Boris N. Yeltsin's Government in the past two weeks has stirred a new round of speculation about the Russian President's true intentions. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin has argued that the managers, all with solid track records both in industry and in reform politics, were needed to bring a critical economic sector into the Government as it moves toward the complex next stage of privatization and conversion. </p> <p> A backlash against President Boris N. Yeltsin's economic reforms is forcing a delay of several months, and perhaps much longer, in the approval of an aid package intended to give Russia at least $24 billion in Western assistance, Russian and American officials say. </p> <p> The delay comes as there are strong signs in Washington that Congress has lost its enthusiasm for giving money to Russia to help finance the International Monetary Fund package that is threatened by the Moscow backlash. </p> <p> The first of July has been billed as the dawn of an ambitious second stage of Russia's economic reform, including, most importantly, a single floating exchange rate for the battered ruble. </p> <p> The changes are important for the Government and for business, but for most individual Russians, they will mean still higher prices for the goods they buy. </p> <p> The Zverev family is getting by in the new Russia, thank you very much. It's not easy, and the Zverevs get grumpy about the contradictions of the present, which is full of confusion, and nervous about the future -- about whether Russia's bet on the West, on democracy and a market economy is going to pay off. </p> <p> But they are managing, finding ways not just to make more money, but to make their lives more rewarding. And the manner in which they have coped with the radical changes in Russian economic life -- far higher prices, but also more possibilities for the even modestly clever -- is a testament to the survival of initiative and entrepreneurship under Soviet Communism. </p> <p> The Russian Government and the International Monetary Fund announced today that they had reached a lending agreement that gives President Boris N. Yeltsin the endorsement he had sought from the West for his economic policies, but also commits him to cut back on Government spending just when the deficit is rising sharply. </p> <p> The I.M.F. had been under pressure for weeks from the Bush Administration to soften its usual requirements so that an agreement with the Yeltsin Government could be announced before a meeting of leaders of the seven industrial powers that begins in Munich on Monday. Mr. Yeltsin is to join President Bush and the other leaders in Munich on Wednesday. </p> <p> The economic summit meetings of the seven industrial democracies, begun 17 years ago in France, are facing a crisis of credibility. With all the talk, pomp and expense, accompanied this year by scant action, people are asking: Where's the beef? </p> <p> The nearest thing, it seemed, was President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. In an unusual twist, the head of an economy in virtually complete chaos, with an "inflation rate" of 640 percent in the past four months, was welcomed today by the Group of Seven as a potential savior. </p> <p> As Russia's ruble began its precarious journey toward being a normal, convertible currency, acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar warned the Russian Parliament today that the Government budget deficit was running out of control. </p> <p> "We have begun to allow ourselves to spend more than we can afford," Mr. Gaidar said, cautioning legislators that there could be no stability for the newly floated ruble if the deficit continued to grow, further fueling inflation. </p> <p> The 64,000 steelworkers at the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Complex, the world's largest steelworks, are beginning to get nervous. The company is 90 days behind in paying wages and is offering instead 50-pound sacks of sugar and pieces of steel that the workers can try to resell. </p> <p> As production falls, 5,000 of the workers do not have a full day's work and some have been sent home on forced vacations. </p> <p> With the House apparently ready to approve a Russian-aid package but delaying the politically sensitive vote until leaders can assemble a healthy bipartisan majority, Ambassador Robert S. Strauss is back from Moscow to work the Hill. </p> <p> Demonstrating that he is still a consummate Washington insider, he is cajoling House members, posing for pictures with their aides, slapping lobbyists on the back, and cursing reporters in good- humored fashion, asking them to help him persuade Congress that the security of the United States could be at stake. </p> <p> Russia will ask the major industrial nations at their summit meeting in Munich for a two-year moratorium on repayments of principal and interest on the former Soviet debt, President Boris N. Yeltsin said today. </p> <p> The industrial nations, known as the G-7, for Group of 7, will meet in Munich starting Monday and have already discussed extending an existing nine-month moratorium, though September, on repayments of principal, as well as longer-term debt relief, as long as Russia's economic reforms continue. </p> <p> No one family, however extended, can possibly represent the full domestic drama of Russia's experiment in finding a new way to live. </p> <p> But the Zverev family, who were willing to sit through many hours of interviews about their lives and expectations, give a reasonable picture of the way Russians are getting by in this complicated transition between totalitarian Communism and a democratic market economy, when inflation is surging and the mind struggles with old habits and new possibilities. </p> <p> The Senate approved today a long-delayed aid package to the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe that authorizes nearly $1 billion in new spending and billions of dollars in credits and loans, all conditioned on continued movement toward democracy and a free market. </p> <p> By a 76-to-20 vote, the Senate passed a bill that supporters said established a new framework for friendly relations between Washington and its former cold-war foes. The House is expected to take up a similar package later this month. </p> <p> The leaders of seven major industrial democracies promised a "comprehensive partnership" with Russia and $1 billion in new aid to Moscow today. But in a meeting with the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, they signaled that the formerly Communist countries of Eastern Europe and the old Soviet Union should expect no further injections of aid until they restructured their economies. </p> <p> In a communique issued today at the end of their three-day economic summit meeting, the seven leaders said future aid to the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe "will be tailored to their reform progress and internationally responsible behavior, including further reductions in military spending and fulfillment of obligations already undertaken." </p> <p> Boris N. Yeltsin's journey to Munich was familiar: the preliminary vow that he would not "get on his knees" before the West, an encouraging pat from leaders of the rich world, a handful of change and promises of far more once he really got moving on reforms. </p> <p> Mikhail S. Gorbachev had made the same pilgrimage a year earlier, when the Group of Seven met in London, and Mr. Yeltsin had recently returned from much the same sort of thing in Washington at a meeting with President Bush. </p> <p> A plan from the new chairman of the Russian Central Bank to reduce the enormous debt burden carried by state industries has deepened the dispute inside the Government over how sharply to curb deficit spending. </p> <p> The plan, proposed last week by the chairman, Viktor Gerashchenko, was reportedly the subject of a heated discussion today by top economic officials, the news agency Interfax said. </p> <p> Twice before in this century, America was summoned to international leadership. After World War I, we ignored the summons, and we and the world paid dearly. After World War II, wiser from experience with depression and dictatorship, we heeded the call to leadership and created the democratic coalition that won the cold war. Today, America is summoned again, this time to secure a democratic peace with Russia, Ukraine and the other new independent states of the former Soviet Union. </p> <p> As President Bush said, "Democrats in the Kremlin can assure our security in a way nuclear missiles never could." The House of Representatives, by passing the Freedom Support Act, can help those democrats -- and help America, too. </p> <p> Arkady I. Volsky has the superficial slickness of a man long accustomed to deference. In his huge office in the old Communist Party's Central Committee headquarters, with all the requisite attendants and the long line of supplicants in the corridor, Mr. Volsky acts as if he has all the time in the world. </p> <p> These days in Russia, it's almost true. Power seems to flow toward Mr. Volsky on an increasingly steep slope built on the chaos of Russia's economy and the inevitable mistakes of the largely theoretical economists around acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, who is the architect of Russia's stumbling reform. </p> <p> Eleven months after the failed Communist coup and seven months after the breakup of the Soviet Union, President Boris N. Yeltsin's reformist Government is in retreat and its radical economic plan is faltering. </p> <p> There is a growing sense that the administration of Acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, who designed Russia's economic reform plan, miscalculated its plans and has lost its authority and bearings. Indications are that the radical reformers are rapidly losing ground to tough directors and managers of state-owned industries who demand a far slower pace of change. </p> <p> After a year of political and economic turmoil, Russians have become accustomed to watching things fall apart. But the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Communist Party and other institutions that once controlled their lives did not prepare them for the last and perhaps most painful shock: a breakdown in the trust and discipline that bound their society together. </p> <p> It is not just a matter of crime, corruption, prostitution, smuggling, and drug and alcohol abuse, although there is plenty of evidence that these are on the rise. There is also a widespread view that now, as Russia goes through another historic convulsion, people are out for themselves and anything goes. </p> <p> On the eve of celebrations for the anniversary of last year's failed coup d'etat, President Boris N. Yeltsin went on television tonight with details of a privatization program that will provide vouchers worth 10,000 rubles (just over $60) for each man, woman and child in Russia. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin, back from a two-week vacation, gave a somber, even defensive assessment of his economic reforms. "Some people say we plunged into the stream before learning to swim," he said. "But we have not choked, nor have we drowned." </p> <p> For seven decades this ancient city, renamed Gorky by the Bolsheviks, led the Soviet Union in making weapons of destruction. Now a new breed of bold leaders hopes that as Nizhny Novgorod once again the city can lead Russia -- this time, into a new phase of economic reform. </p> <p> From offices in the medieval citadel, a brash young Governor, a Mayor who used to fight white-collar crime and a crusading economist, backed by some imported Western talent, are plotting an ambitious and independent economic path that they believe could provide a model for the stalled reforms of Moscow, 250 miles to the west. </p> <p> Yegor T. Gaidar, the Acting Prime Minister of Russia, insists that the Government's economic program is still on track, despite mounting pressures from a powerful industrial lobby that has raised alarms among members of Parliament and the press who support the changes. </p> <p> The 36-year-old economist said in an interview today that while compromises have been made with the industrial sector since the program began in January, these compromises have so far not undercut the targets on inflation and deficit spending agreed upon earlier this summer with the International Monetary Fund. </p> <p> After 45 years of voting for foreign aid to combat the Soviet Union, the House voted today to provide billions of dollars in assistance to Russia and the other former Soviet republics. </p> <p> The action assures Congressional approval of an aid package that President Bush has called essential to the post-cold-war world and that President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia told Congress in June would help guarantee the success of his efforts to nourish democratic and economic reform. </p> <p> On the sandy shores of the Gulf of Finland, where it curves above St. Petersburg, lies a pristine swatch of pine and birch forests that somehow managed to escape Soviet development. </p> <p> Vyacheslav Kozyritsky, the 41-year-old Mayor of Zelenogorsk, wants to change all that. Where generations of Russian writers, artists and Communist bosses saw unspoiled nature, he sees opportunity -- for hotels, shopping centers, business parks, single-family housing, garden apartments, in short, a "New Petersburg" on a scale that would shock even the most ambitious American developer. </p> <p> Putting the uproar over his sudden cancellation of a trip to Japan behind him, President Boris N. Yeltsin thrust himself into the center of domestic politics today with a strong warning about the dangers threatening his economic program. </p> <p> At a conference of local officials in the Volga River city of Cheboksary, Mr. Yeltsin denounced what he said were policies of "cheap credits and unrealistic social programs" pushing the Russian economy toward an abyss. </p> <p> As the Soviet welfare system collapses, the feminization of poverty may become the new Russia's largest and cruelest problem. </p> <p> In Moscow, 70 percent of the newly unemployed are women between the ages of 45 and 55. When I visited one of Moscow's recently established unemployment offices this summer, women in line described the kind of discrimination they now face in the job market. Some were turned away because they were too old -- in their 40's. Others had been told that their maternal responsibilities made them unreliable workers. </p> <p> President Bush's new world order, which assigns leadership to the United States as the surviving superpower, clearly did not apply this week to the European currency turmoil. While the United States Government stood by, Germany marched Europe to the German agenda. </p> <p> Similarly, Mr. Bush's call last spring for rapid approval of foreign loans for Russia was not repeated by the Administration this week at the semiannual gathering of the world's finance ministers and central bank presidents -- a meeting that is frequently a platform from which to push America's foreign economic goals. The White House was silent on Russia. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin's chief economic planner opened a new round of grappling with the hostile Parliament today with a warning that unless his spartan monetary policies were restored, the Russian monetary system faced a "complete crash." </p> <p> The warning by Yegor T. Gaidar, the embattled Acting Prime Minister, served notice that he did not intend to let his economic course be torpedoed by a torrent of new credits issued by the new director of the Central Bank, Viktor Gerashchenko, who was appointed in June by the Parliament. </p> <p> As summer draws to an end and Russians drift back to work after a month of backyard farming at their country cottages, the economy is showing signs of a looming price explosion that some experts predict could double the inflation rate by mid-autumn. </p> <p> A tumble in the value of the ruble, which fell 25 percent against the dollar at restricted currency auctions over the last week, is just one sign of the wide perception that prices are about to soar again after a summer lull. </p> <p> Ask about the "free market" or "reform," and people out on these fertile South Russian plains still begin to snarl. </p> <p> But ask about the price of wheat or the cost of fuel, and the animated patter tells a different story. A year after the Government began to wean agriculture from the hugely inefficient Soviet system, some tender new shoots of market are appearing in the hardened old collective farms, the kolkhozes. </p> <p> If dragging Russia into the high-tech consumer age has proved harder than anyone suspected, don't blame the language. Since the dawn of the Age of Perestroika, the jargon of American business and electronics has been eagerly welcomed in Russia, from the entry-level </p> <p> biznes </p> <p> and </p> <p> kompyutery </p> <p> through </p> <p> griny </p> <p> , or </p> <p> buksy </p> <p> (dollars), </p> <p> press rilis </p> <p> and </p> <p> imidzh </p> <p> (image). </p> <p> One reason is that unlike the Russian character, which is traditionally resistant to innovation, the Russian language, with its plethora of prefixes and endings, is eminently suited to adopt and shape verbal imports. Tack on a syllable at the front or back, change a thing here or there, and a new arrival takes on forms even its parents would not recognize. Xerox, for example, keenly sensitive to the misuse of its familiar trade name as a common verb, might easily overlook the rise of </p> <p> otserit </p> <p> -- a Russian evolution of </p> <p> ot-kseroks-iro </p> <p> vat </p> <p> (to make a Xerox). </p> <p> Confused by the loss of an empire and frustrated by an inflation rate that keeps emptying their pockets, many Russians have fixed their fear and anxiety on a convenient target: traders from the Caucasus who have virtually taken over the farmers markets in Moscow and other cities, offering a tantalizing array of roses, lemons, bananas, bootlegged caviar, eggplant, Bulgarian chickens and other goods at prices beyond the average shopper's reach. </p> <p> More and more, people mutter darkly of an invasion by "blacks." The term is used loosely here to describe the dark-haired southerners who until recently were described on police blotters as "people of a Caucasian nationality." They include Azerbaijanis, Armenians and Georgians, but also people from Dagestan, Chechenya and other autonomous republics within Russia. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin and his Prime Minister separately defended their economic program before the Russian Parliament today, but with variations that spoke of the struggle now being waged over the further course of reform. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin, addressing the fall session of the legislature, acknowledged "serious errors" in economic management and assailed three members of his Cabinet by name -- Andrei A. Nechayev, the economics minister; Pyotr O. Aven, minister for foreign economic relations, and Aleksandr A. Titkin, minister for industry. </p> <p> Ever since Czar Aleksandr II sold Alaska to the Americans, Kamchatka has been Russia's easternmost frontier -- a peninsula roughly the size of Montana, with snow-tipped volcanoes, sputtering geysers and miles of untouched birch forests that turn amber in the fading light of autumn. </p> <p> Here, nine time zones away from Moscow, nature is still undefeated, in contrast to the rest of Russia, where the environment was regularly sacrificed to the reckless god of industrial development. On Kamchatka, the rivers are still clean enough for freshwater crayfish and spawning salmon, while in winter the snow in its volcanic craters is so white that local people describe it as almost blue. </p> <p> In an atmosphere of mounting political confrontation, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia called today for the disbanding of the National Salvation Front, an opposition group made up of ultra-nationalists and old-guard Communists that held its founding congress last weekend. </p> <p> At a meeting with top officials of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Mr. Yeltsin said the front was both unconstitutional and politically destabilizing, and declared its activities "inadmissable." </p> <p> Campaigning for his embattled reforms two weeks before a crucial session of the Russian legislature, President Boris N. Yeltsin lashed out today at the political forces ranged against him. </p> <p> "Of late, there has been an unbridled campaign in the country to fire political hysteria," Mr. Yeltsin said before the powerful lobby of industrial managers. </p> <p> Until this year, the diamonds mined here at the giant Peace pit, dug a quarter-mile deep into the harsh Siberian landscape, have been more a source of misery than of wealth for the residents of Yakutia, the largest and arguably the richest of Russia's autonomous regions. </p> <p> Yakutia's diamonds, which account for 99 percent of Russia's production and one-fourth of the world's, were discovered here in 1957. But Mirny, the hub of the diamond industry, started to pave its roads only five years ago, and still has 40 percent of them to go. Despite winter temperatures of 40 degrees below zero, many residents still live in wooden huts where, as one inhabitant put it, all the facilities are outside except the beds, and the only running water comes in spring when the snow melts. </p> <p> The Peace Corps is sending its first volunteers to Russia this week. On Friday, 102 business executives and graduates of business schools will arrive in Moscow for three months of language training before being assigned to small business centers throughout Russia. </p> <p> Like a general rallying his troops on the eve of battle, President Boris N. Yeltsin told his supporters today that the reforms he had introduced were "the main cause of my entire life" and that he would remain committed to those policies, "whatever turn things may take." </p> <p> On the other side of the city, outside the gates to Gorky Park, several hundred die-hard Communists braved arctic temperatures at a rally of their own, waving red flags and a banner that reduced the approaching clash to its bare bones: "Lenin Yes! Yeltsin No!" </p> <p> LOOKING LIKE POOH Bear in the lions' den, Yegor Timurovich Gaidar, the Acting Prime Minister of Russia, strode to the podium to face his harshest audience, the Supreme Soviet, the standing Parliament chosen 21 months before the Soviet Union collapsed. </p> <p> Gaidar, only 36 years old, was sweating, clearly nervous. The Parliament had come back into session this day, Sept. 22, after a summer of increasingly bitter denunciations of Gaidar and his Government, which is dominated by young, westernized economists like himself. </p> <p> A year ago, the stories out of Moscow were full of dark warnings about starvation, destitution, chaos and coups as the Soviet Union lurched toward its end. </p> <p> This has not been a wonderful year for the Russian economy, as an inexperienced Government tries to manage an extraordinary transition to a capitalistic system. There is more poverty, purchasing power is down, industrial production has dropped to 75 percent of what it was a year ago, inflation is running at about 25 percent a month and the ruble is hovering around 450 to the dollar, compared with 135 at the end of June. </p> <p> When Robert S. Strauss arrived here to take up his post as the United States Ambassador, there was a coup going on, so on the drive in from the airport he settled back for a nap. "There won't be much time to sleep later on," he explained to his surprised wife. </p> <p> Leaving Moscow a tempestuous 15 months later, Mr. Strauss said he was still not sure when there would be rest. But he said he was convinced that if Russia could hang tough through an additional 18 to 24 months without an explosion, the country's economic crisis would begin to lift. </p> <p> When Robert S.

But he said he was convinced that if Russia could hang tough through an additional 18 to 24 months without an explosion, the country's economic crisis would begin to lift. </p> <p> Having set off a storm of criticism by dismissing the outspoken chief of central television, President Boris N. Yeltsin took another step today toward appeasing his opposition by accepting the resignation of his pugnacious Information Minister. </p> <p> Coming only days before an important session of Russia's legislature, Mr. Yeltsin's sudden dismissal of two men known for their support of openness in the press suggested to many today that he was so deeply committed to working out a compromise with the conservative legislators to achieve qualified support of his economic reform plan that he was willing to appear less than dedicated to an independent press and television. </p> <p> The Russian legislature today called on Acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar to amend his latest economic program, thus delivering a last-minute rebuke to the Government as it prepares for next week's gathering of the Congress of People's Deputies. </p> <p> The Parliament's overwhelming vote, 135 to 14, reflected dissatisfaction with a report given by Mr. Gaidar on Thursday, which some members of the centrist opposition saw as a betrayal of a joint effort to coordinate economic policies on the eve of the Congress. </p> <p> Looking to win a firm show of Western backing, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia swept through London today, signing a flurry of broad agreements on economic and political cooperation with Britain and then making a fresh appeal to the West to do more to ease his country's crippling burden of debt. </p> <p> Closing the first day of a two-day visit, Mr. Yeltsin told a group of London bankers and business people that if Moscow is to find a way out of its cash crisis, money borrowed by the Soviet Union in its last 11 months of existence must be included in any debt-rescheduling plan. </p> <p> A few days after Lithuania's former Communists surged ahead in the first round of elections for a new parliament, pranksters put up a mock Lenin statue, made of cardboard with Russian rubles pinned on its chest, in what used to be Lenin Square. </p> <p> The figure draw a crowd of agitated citizens ready to dissect the elections on Oct. 25 for signs that Lithuania, once again, is setting a trend. </p> <p> Lithuanian voters angry at economic difficulties and cold apartments have repudiated the Sajudis movement that brought them independence, giving a party of former Communists a working majority in a new Parliament. </p> <p> After a stinging defeat on Sunday in a second, runoff round of elections for Parliament, the bitter leader of the defeated party, Vytautas Landsbergis, who announced independence in March 1990, warned that "we are moving back toward the one-party rule we saw before 1988." </p> <p> Saying he needed to "restore order" and protect the reformist core of Russia's Government, President Boris N. Yeltsin cut short his visit to China this morning and headed back to Moscow. </p> <p> His new Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, whom Mr. Yeltsin chose this week after parliamentary pressure forced him to abandon acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, was on his own visit to Kazakhstan, and Moscow itself seemed quiet early this morning. </p> <p> A year after the end of the Soviet Union, anything goes in Moscow. </p> <p> In front of the "Artistic Salon" on Dimitrova Street, where paintings and other works of art are offered for sale in three large rooms with huge picture windows visible to all passersby, signs "categorically" forbid the freelance sale of art or artistic materials outside, by order of the Moscow City Council. </p> <p> Large-scale foreign economic and financial aid to Russia, which many economists still believe is essential for a transformation to a market economy, has been pushed off the international agenda by political uncertainties here and by a global recession that affects potential donors. </p> <p> The political struggle in Russia between pro-market forces, led by President Boris N. Yeltsin, and legislators who resist the painful aspects of change leaves many Western investors and diplomats skeptical about investing large amounts. </p> <p> Despite a series of recent setbacks for President Boris N. Yeltsin's drive to establish a market economy in Russia, many Western economists and experts say that the transition is likely to continue, at a slower pace, and that the process may be too far along to be reversed. </p> <p> In a dozen interviews, experts on Russia as well as officials who deal with Russia in the United States Government, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank said they were disappointed that Mr. Yeltsin had been thwarted in his efforts. But they said they no longer feared that the Yeltsin reforms were in danger of being undone. </p> <p> With his job on the line and his program under attack, Acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar told a hostile legislature today that the country must stop inflation and runaway spending, or face the fate of the underdeveloped third world. </p> <p> Mr. Gaidar, whose policies for economic change are the focus of the Congress of People's Deputies, gave little ground to critics, whom he accused of indulging in "the economics of populism" and of ignoring the dangers of an inflation rate that is now 25 percent a month. </p> <p> Looking down into the abyss of hyperinflation a condition that bred totalitarianism in Germany -- Russian leaders, old and new, are now deciding which economic model to follow. </p> <p> One model is Western-style capitalism that couples political democracy with free markets. The Poles and Czechs, having accepted the hardship of such "shock therapy," are making this dual freedom work. </p> <p> Outmaneuvered in the end by the hostile Russian Congress, President Boris N. Yeltsin today surrendered Yegor T. Gaidar, the architect and symbol of his economic program, and in his stead named a veteran manager of the state energy sector to be Prime Minister. </p> <p> The stunning reversal, and the question mark it raised over the continuation of the already limping program of economic change, concluded a two-week power struggle between Mr. Yeltsin and the bellicose Congress of People's Deputies, during which the tide of battle shifted frequently and furiously. </p> <p> Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, Russia's new Prime Minister, has had a long and successful career as a manager and Cabinet minister in charge of the country's huge gas and energy complex. </p> <p> What was striking today was how few of the legislators who voted for him know very much about him. But many said they knew the type: a strong, experienced administrator who ran a vital industry with wide international contacts, but who was no Communist Party hack. </p> <p> When the former Communist countries of the old Soviet bloc seek advice on capitalism, they look not just to financial centers like New York and Chicago. More and more, former Soviet republics and other Eastern European countries are turning to smaller post-industrial American cities, like Baltimore and Pittsburgh, for economic advice and intellectual exchange. </p> <p> "Old industrial societies of the West have faced the same environmental and economic problems Russia now faces," said Blair A. Ruble, director of the Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies in Washington. "Russians see difficulties and need desperately to talk to people who have faced these issues on a similar scale." </p> <p> By a hair's breadth, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia today survived the most serious challenge yet mounted by hard-line opponents in Parliament intent on altering the course of his economic changes and curbing his powers. </p> <p> In secret balloting, the country's highest-ranking legislative body fell a few votes short of adopting constitutional amendments that would have diluted Mr. Yeltsin's control over the Government and given new powers to a Parliament dominated by an increasingly militant majority of hard-liners. </p> <p> From the political turmoil in Russia in recent days, two men have emerged with enhanced influence: Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the new and relatively unknown Prime Minister, who has spent most of his life in the oil and gas industry, and Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, who has burst from obscurity to make his job of Speaker of the legislature into a new power center. </p> <p> In separate news conferences today, both appealed for calm and consensus, but in radically different tones. </p> <p> At 4 P.M., as the winter sky darkens, thousands of traders from the giant flea-market at the Luzhniki Sports Stadium here trudge homeward through the dirt and slush, lugging bags and suitcases stuffed with unsold goods. </p> <p> For many Russians today, this is the "market" that the politicians have been talking about in the Kremlin for all these weeks. It is not a free exchange of goods and services, it is not checking accounts or credit cards, or even unemployment benefits and unpaid bills. It is standing in the cold for hours on end, holding up cheap cosmetics, or sweaters imported from Turkey, or the odd pair of boots or shoes, waiting for someone to come and buy. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin, in a brief but sharp address to an increasingly fractious Congress of People's Deputies, urged lawmakers today not to approve a set of constitutional amendments that he said would weaken the Government, endanger economic reform and lead the country to anarchy. </p> <p> The Congress, the country's highest legislative body, is set to vote on Saturday in secret balloting on changes to the Constitution that would require the President to submit the nomination and dismissal of top Cabinet ministers to Parliament for approval. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin, opening a session of the Russian Congress, acknowledged today that his economic changes were shriveling the living standards of most Russians. But he insisted that a change in course was not the answer. </p> <p> In a speech to 1,041 deputies in the glittering Grand Kremlin Palace, Mr. Yeltsin asked for "a respite of a year to a year and a half" from the disputes over his program, but preliminary skirmishes suggested that the session would not pass peacefully. </p> <p> A year and a half ago, Vladislav Vasnev and two other graduate-school dropouts began selling goods on commission from a rented kiosk on Lubyanka Square, outside the great yellow headquarters of the K.G.B. </p> <p> Now, Mr. Vasnev, who is 24, is the czar of Moscow's downtown street marts, selling handmade souvenirs, video equipment, shoes, clothing, watches and other goods from a chain of custom-made booths that stretch from a street off Red Square, down to the central square opposite the Bolshoi Theater, and up Petrovka, one of the city's oldest thoroughfares. </p> <p> Dallas's third touchdown, which gave them a 24-3 lead and put the game all but out of reach, came on a 23-yard run by Emmitt Smith in the third quarter. It came on a draw play that is one of the Cowboys' favorites; that also means they often execute it better than other plays because they enjoy running it. They have used it all season long and in both previous games against Eagles. No doubt Philadelphia had prepared for the play, so the fact that the Cowboys scored on it indicates how well it was executed. </p> <p> Basically, it's a cutback draw. The Eagles knew this draw would be run but did not recognize it from this formation, which was a formation Dallas had been using in this game but not running the draw play on. Dallas also says that this is Smith's best play and he makes things happen on it. </p> <p> Dallas's third touchdown, which gave them a 24-3 lead and put the game all but out of reach, came on a 23-yard run by Emmitt Smith in the third quarter.

Tikhomirov, the burly, chain-smoking, backslapping boss of this textile center 150 miles northeast of Moscow, thinks he is a reformer, too. </p> <p> In the context of Soviet history, maybe he is. But he is also an unrepentant part of the majority in the Russian legislature that forced President Boris N. Yeltsin to dump the architect of his economic program, Acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, and replace him with the former head of the gas industry, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. </p> <p> When Russians complain about the failures of economic reform, they point to cities like Ivanovo. </p> <p> A large textile center 150 miles northeast of Moscow that once clothed half the army and produced one of every four square yards of fabric in the Soviet Union, Ivanovo is suffering by any measure. Output has dropped by half, warehouses are empty, cotton and other raw materials are almost unavailable. </p> <p> The value of the Russian ruble plunged today by more than 13 percent in trading at the Moscow currency exchange, breaking a 500-ruble-to-the-dollar barrier, an event widely seen as a signal of looming hyperinflation. </p> <p> With the ruble now valued at less than one-fifth of a cent, its record low value is sure to do further damage to an economy already crippled by huge internal debt, rising inflation and a sharp drop in production. </p> <p> Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia warned Western officials today that inflation in his country would be close to 50 percent this month, putting Russia on what he called "the verge of hyperinflation." </p> <p> His statement, at an annual gathering of political and business leaders known as the World Economic Forum, was issued as several leading Russian economic officials and Western advisers pleaded for quick financial support to rescue Russia from an imminent tumble into economic chaos. </p> <p> Although a Federal grand jury has declined to indict Senator Charles S. Robb in an electronic eavesdropping case, the Virginia Democrat's troubles are far from over. </p> <p> The jury's decision on Tuesday was a major surprise. Even the Senator had predicted he would be indicted for recordings made of conversations involving his chief political rival, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder. Something happened in the late stages of the grand jury's deliberations, but there are only questions, no explanations, of what. </p> <p> Although a Federal grand jury has declined to indict Senator Charles S.

Fyodorov conceded that the battle over economic policy in Russia is still far from over. </p> <p> The famous State Department Store on Red Square, best known by its Russian acronym, GUM, formally became private more than two years ago, when the trading company that leases the building was divided among the workers and the city. </p> <p> But now any Russian get a piece of GUM, a covered mall that houses many shops, including branches of some well-known Western retailers like Galeries Lafayette, Escada, Samsonite, Benetton, Lego and Estee Lauder. </p> <p> In an unusually strong criticism, the International Monetary Fund's top official faulted Russia's Government today for letting inflation get out of control, saying the risk of hyperinflation threatened Russia's fledgling democracy. </p> <p> The official, Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director, said hyperinflation would hurt Russia's poor the most, would jeopardize other economic reforms, and was causing a severe flight of capital that would make economic recovery more difficult. </p> <p> Reflecting the complexity of Russia's problems, one of the Central Intelligence Agency's most senior analysts today laid out the divisions within the intelligence community and among independent Western and Russian experts on how best to reform Russia and promote its nascent democracy. </p> <p> George Kolt, the National Intelligence Officer for Russia and Eurasia, told a Senate panel of three broad areas of disagreement over the degree and pace of reform. His testimony illustrates how difficult it will be for the Clinton Administration to reach a consensus on a strategy for Russia as it begins its formal policy review. </p> <p> With two months to go before he and 11 co-defendants stand trial on charges of high treason for their role in the hard-line Communist coup in August 1991, Anatoly I. Lukyanov is not entertaining second thoughts. </p> <p> When not helping the old Communist Party struggle to its feet, the wily and versatile former chairman of the Soviet Parliament, which is now defunct, has been polishing off a new cycle of sonnets, while awaiting publication of a more prosaic work, "The Coup -- Fake and Real." </p> <p> Old cold warriors need not fade away. Take Richard M. Nixon -- at 80, he is battling on with much of the same fervor he showed in his celebrated jousts with Nikita S. Khrushchev 34 years ago. Only he is not fighting against Communists now, but for Russia. </p> <p> In speeches, on Op-Ed pages and today in Russia, the former President has become one of the most dedicated advocates of the notion that the United States must not ignore Russia now that Communism has collapsed. </p> <p> The Russian Government, faced with troubling new signs of very high inflation, sharply increased the prices for natural gas and telephone calls today as President Boris N. Yeltsin called for national resolve in the face of deprivation and difficulty. </p> <p> Speaking in a nationwide address on his 62d birthday, Mr. Yeltsin compared Russia's economic difficulties -- with inflation roaring again at nearly 2 percent a day and food prices up 42 percent in the first three weeks of January -- to some of the darkest times in the fight against Nazi Germany. </p> <p> The Russian Government, faced with troubling new signs of very high inflation, sharply increased the prices for natural gas and telephone calls today as President Boris N. Yeltsin called for national resolve in the face of deprivation and difficulty. </p> <p> Speaking in a nationwide address on his 62d birthday, Mr. Yeltsin compared Russia's economic difficulties -- with inflation roaring again at nearly 2 percent a day and food prices up 42 percent in the first three weeks of January -- to some of the darkest times in the fight against Nazi Germany. </p> <p> Adjourning after a tumultuous four-day session, the Congress of People's Deputies agreed today to a referendum next month on Russia's rule, setting the stage for another round in its overheated confrontation with President Boris N. Yeltsin. </p> <p> One day after it narrowly failed to oust the President, the Congress accepted his call for a national vote of confidence in his leadership on April 25, but wrapped it in additional questions and conditions that threatened to make the results indecisive. </p> <p> Those who would disagree, as I do, with some of the specific proposals in President Clinton's economic program must give him credit for his boldness and political courage in advocating them and for his indefatigable efforts to sell them to the American people. </p> <p> If he demonstrates the same leadership qualities in addressing the major foreign policy issue of our time, he can secure his place in history as a great President. That issue is the survival and success of political and economic freedom in Russia. </p> <p> The need to clarify U.S. policy toward Russia has been heightened by the political crisis in Moscow. Our long-term interests there can be promoted by practical aid and people-to-people programs. </p> <p> Boris Yeltsin's solution to the impasse between a popularly elected President and a Parliament that, under the Constitution, is the supreme organ of the state shows he believes the answer to the problems of emerging democracy is more democracy. He has cast his fate on the seas of his own waning but still significant popularity. </p> <p> President Clinton today brushed aside criticism that he was too closely tied to President Boris N. Yeltsin, saying that Mr. Yeltsin's decision to circumvent the Russian Parliament was "appropriate" and that he would give Mr. Yeltsin "an aggressive and quite specific plan" of aid at their summit meeting. </p> <p> "Boris Yeltsin is the elected President of Russia, and he has shown a great deal of courage in sticking up for democracy and civil liberties and market reforms, and I'm going to support that," Mr. Clinton said, adding that he would begin briefing Congress this week on his aid proposals. </p> <p> The People's Congress voted overwhelmingly today to sharply curb President Boris N. Yeltsin's powers and to cancel a planned referendum next month that he had hoped would give him a popular mandate to accelerate economic change. </p> <p> A final vote is expected Friday. But already this evening it was evident that the thousand deputies, elected three years ago under the Communist system, intended to reject any proposals put forth by Mr. Yeltsin and to assume more authority for themselves and for their chairman, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov. </p> <p> High-ranking Russian officials deliberately exaggerated the risks of hyperinflation in January in an effort to convince a new Russian Prime Minister that financial stabilization must take priority in economic policy, Government officials and advisers say. </p> <p> In the last two months, while President Boris N. Yeltsin has been struggling over the levers of power with the parliamentary speaker, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, the Russian economy has been deteriorating -- but not as fast as some in the Government would have the world believe. </p> <p> As demonstrators gathered by the Russian Parliament building today on the banks of the Moscow River, President Boris N. Yeltsin got his first set of early returns from the Russian people, who will be asked in a month to break the country's political stalemate. </p> <p> By midafternoon, two opposing crowds had formed, facing off across barricades reinforced by rows of parked jeeps and buses. One was rallying under a forest of red Soviet flags, symbol of the Communist-nationalist opposition to Mr. Yeltsin's Government; the other, across the street, was waving the white, red and blue of the Russian tricolor, which has become Mr. Yeltsin's emblem. </p> <p> Revving up their all-out verbal attack against President Boris N. Yeltsin and his battered economic program, his major opponents in the Russian Congress have dropped all pretenses and revealed their unreconstructed Communist instincts. </p> <p> As the members of the Congress of People's Deputies gather for the ninth time since their election in 1990, the word "democrat" is spoken with a contemptuous sneer, while "comrade," once used solely by the staunchest of Communists, has become fashionable again. </p> <p> Despite the battering of President Boris N. Yeltsin and his Government by conservatives in the Congress of People's Deputies, no one expects a return to the centralized command economy of socialism, which is widely understood to be as failed an economic idea as Communism is a political one. </p> <p> The consensus among diplomats, economists and other analysts is that some sort of market economy will emerge, in large part because no alternative seems readily available. </p> <p> The leader of Russia's Legislature indicated on the eve of a session of the Congress of People's Deputies that he would try to head off a vote on ousting President Boris N. Yeltsin. </p> <p> His statement reinforced speculation that the deputies lacked the two-thirds majority needed to vote the President out of office. But as the deputies converged on Moscow from around Russia and both sides issued their final appeals, it was evident that this would be the most contentious and fateful session of the Congress in the three years since it was elected. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin was not the only one to leave the Congress of People's Deputies in disgust this week. Today, Viktor P. Mironov, a 43-year-old deputy who took office three years ago on the first wave of Russian democracy, went up to a microphone and announced that he was handing in his mandate as a deputy to protest the "return of the Communist dictatorship." </p> <p> "Enough is enough," he said later outside the coatroom of the Grand Kremlin Palace, explaining his solitary walkout. "I don't want to be an extra in this spectacle, with 700 Communists running the show. For all intents and purposes, this Congress was a coup d'etat." </p> <p> Barely pausing for a backhanded rejection of President Boris N. Yeltsin's final bid for a national referendum on who should govern Russia, the Congress of People's Deputies today concluded a four-day rout of the President and dispersed for another three months. </p> <p> Abandoning even the pretense of national unity that they made at previous sessions, the 1,000 or so deputies left with a statement to the nation that harshly criticized the President and his reforms and left little doubt that the confrontation would only get worse. </p> <p> The elderly woman, confined to her room on the fourth floor of a rundown building in Moscow's proletarian district, knew how she wanted to vote in Russia's referendum today. "For Yeltsin," she said, firmly addressing the two young election workers who had brought her a sealed ballot box upon her request. </p> <p> As they explained patiently, that meant that she would have to cross out the "nyet,"or "no," on the ballot. However puzzling it might seem, the only way to register support for President Boris N. Yeltsin was to negate a negative -- just one of many confusing moments in this befuddled, though potentially crucial, vote. </p> <p> A week before a crucial referendum on Boris N. Yeltsin's presidency, the Yeltsin Foundation, organized to marshal support for him here in his hometown, has total assets in hand of 80,000 rubles, or about $101. </p> <p> Alya I. Tanachyova, a former Yeltsin aide and family friend who runs the foundation, rather apologetically displays a small pile of placards and leaflets urging support for Mr. Yeltsin in the nationwide vote on April 25. Mr. Yeltsin has portrayed the vote as pitting the democratic future against the totalitarian past and says it will decide who will govern Russia: he or the conservative legislature, a holdover from the Communist era. </p> <p> To help the former Soviet bloc's transition to a market economy, the International Monetary Fund unveiled a program today to provide billions of dollars in loans under less stringent conditions than usual to Russia and more than 20 other countries. </p> <p> Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director, said the program would provide $4 billion to $6 billion in loans during the next 18 months to help former Soviet bloc nations buy imported goods, ranging from food to spare parts needed to modernize industry. </p> <p> She was 16 years old, a prostitute, when they met. He was 55. But that was not the only reason the relationship ended, as it seemed destined to, in tears. </p> <p> He bedecked her in clothes of fine Turkish leather. She sold them. He set her up in an apartment across the Bosporus. She left him. </p> <p> Like most events in Russia these days, the announcement by the Group of Seven on Thursday of a new Western aid package was quickly turned into a weapon by each of the opposing sides in Moscow's political wars. </p> <p> Pravda, the old Communist Party daily that now reflects the opinion of the conservative-nationalist opposition, reacted to the package approved in Tokyo by the leading industrial nations with a rhetorical question: "What then does Russia get out of this?" The answer: "A further increase in its dependence on the West in different spheres." </p> <p> Russia is at a painful turning point, facing momentous alternatives but appearing powerless to make a deliberate choice. Its people stand at the junction of their authoritarian traditions and their novel experiment with political freedom; they hover between a state economy and a free market; they are simultaneously bound together and driven apart by their history and their current striving for a new identity. </p> <p> Hardly any nation's future is more crucial to global well-being than Russia's and hardly any nation's future is more uncertain. After decades of gray, predictable Soviet inertia, the land that sprawls some 6,000 miles from Europe to the Pacific rim churns with volatility. Even tomorrow is a question. </p> <p> As President Boris Yeltsin and President Clinton were preparing for their summit meeting, scheduled for this weekend, the rising confrontation between Yeltsin and his legislature reached a crescendo. In the absence of a firm constitutional structure, any outcome seemed possible. </p> <p> Not so long ago, Boris Yeltsin was Communist Party boss in Sverdlovsk and Bill Clinton was Governor of Arkansas. Now both country pols have made good: the back-slapping Russian bear and the bear-hugging American. And now they are binding their fortunes and futures in Vancouver, the Russian plotting to survive and the American to succeed in a place appropriately much closer to Washington than to Moscow -- and at a meeting it is no longer fitting to call a summit. </p> <p> Both men overcame long odds with perseverance and daring to get to Vancouver. Each in his own way, each according to his circumstance. </p> <p> From the day the first parcels of relief aid were unloaded from American military aircraft at Moscow's international airport more than a year ago, Russians have been puzzled by what they see as the West's fumbling attempts to help their beleaguered country. </p> <p> First, amid a blaze of publicity, came shipments of food, ranging from baby food to American military rations left over from the Persian Gulf war. Then the Group of Seven major industrialized nations patched together a complex $24 billion financial aid package intended to help Russia build a vibrant economy. </p> <p> Despite a new round of appeals and incentives from abroad to push for economic reform, President Boris N. Yeltsin is raising wages, increasing spending and issuing low-cost credits for bankrupt industries as part of a campaign to win a crucial referendum this month. </p> <p> The steps being carried out by Mr. Yeltsin include linking interest on savings to inflation, raising benefits for the military and maintaining price controls -- all of which economists say swell the Government deficit and aggravate inflation. </p> <p> Under heavy pressure from the Clinton Administration and other Western governments, the International Monetary Fund is moving to ease restrictions on aid to Russia with the aim of freeing several billion dollars in assistance. </p> <p> The much-needed burst of new assistance to the suffering Russian economy would follow a year when the monetary fund gave Moscow far less money than anticipated because Russia failed to take the strict austerity measures the fund demanded. </p> <p> Charles Bennett, West Point class of 1962, trained as a navigator bombardier on a B-52, preparing to drop nuclear bombs on the Soviet Union. Today, at 54, he is a Peace Corps volunteer in the small city of Kamyshin on the Volga River, teaching Russians how to create small businesses in a market economy. </p> <p> "I had a military flavor to my life," he said, rubbing a hand over his graying mustache. "The idea was to protect America, kill the enemy and not be friends. But now the big threat is over, and it's a hell of a reversal. Here I am now eating dinner at the tables of people I was willing to turn into dust." </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin's victory in the referendum on Sunday produced expressions of relief today from the White House, the State Department and Congressional supporters of the proposed $1.8 billion aid package for Russia, which would have been killed by a vote of no confidence. </p> <p> "This is a very, very good day, not only for the people of Russia, but for the people of the United States and all the people of the world," President Clinton said today during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House where he greeted members the University of Arkansas track team. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin's opponents moved quickly today to discredit the results of Sunday's referendum. According to incomplete returns, a solid majority of Russian voters backed both Mr. Yeltsin and his program of economic change. </p> <p> An unexpectedly large turnout, estimated at 65.7 percent, helped Mr. Yeltsin score a popular victory over the Congress of People's Deputies, the bulwark of his conservative opposition, which was brusquely rebuffed by voters. But even with 93.5 percent of the vote counted, it was clear that the referendum had failed to resolve Russia's political wars, and instead only opened a new front. </p> <p> Under pressure from Western governments and the International Monetary Fund, which are stepping up their aid, the Russian central bank has agreed with the Russian Government to limit its granting of low- or no-cost loans that inflate the country's money supply. </p> <p> Though technical and possibly temporary, covering only the second quarter of 1993, the agreement is very important. The unrestrained issuing of these credits by the central bank has driven Russian inflation to dangerous levels, devalued the ruble and undermined the economic reforms of President Boris N. Yeltsin. </p> <p> In the old days voting was much easier in remote villages like this, the math teacher at the village school recalled. </p> <p> The Communist Party committee herded everybody together in the social hall, then everybody voted in favor of whatever the Communists wanted and went off satisfied that they had made no difference whatever. </p> <p> Declaring that the United States "cannot stop investing in the peace now that we have obtained it," President Clinton today began the arduous task of convincing Americans preoccupied with domestic woes that it is also necessary to help restore the economy of Russia. </p> <p> Mr. Clinton, in a speech to the American Society of Newspaper Editors, laid the groundwork for the summit meeting he will hold with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia this weekend by signaling that he does not intend to neglect concerns at home. </p> <p> Finance ministers from the major industrialized nations urged President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia today to use his victory in the referendum last weekend to press ahead faster with reforms to create a market economy. </p> <p> After the finance ministers met in Washington, several officials said Russia would be able to take maximum advantage of the $28 billion in aid that the Group of Seven promised it only if it pushed rapidly ahead with change. </p> <p> While there were arguments here today over how much of the $28 billion in aid pledged by the wealthy industrial nations will reach Russia quickly, there were fewer doubts about another group likely to benefit: foreign businesses eager to finance risky operations in Russia. </p> <p> No sooner had the delegates to the conference on Russian aid handed out fact sheets explaining their complex new program, than they moved on to the issue of expanding trade and developing jobs -- in their own countries. </p> <p> Seeking to help President Boris N. Yeltsin's political fortunes, the leading industrialized nations committed themselves today to $28 billion in aid for Russia, most intended to be delivered this year, although much of it was contingent on austerity steps that Moscow may find difficult to adopt. </p> <p> Most of the package announced today is to be provided by various international lending agencies, not the United States Treasury. But it did include about $2 billion in United States credits or loan guarantees to pay for Russian imports of American goods, and separately the Administration announced a new commitment of $1.8 billion in direct aid that seems likely to require Congressional approval. </p> <p> That Boris N. Yeltsin won a vote of confidence in the national referendum three weeks ago, nobody denies. But what that means is a matter of sharp debate. </p> <p> Ardent supporters of radical change, who had hoped that the President would seize on the victory to sweep aside the bothersome legislative opposition and to ram through sweeping market reforms, have been disappointed. </p> <p> After decades as a virtually sealed military fortress at the point where Russia's endless expanse finally runs up against China, North Korea and the sea, Vladivostok has opened up with a vengeance. </p> <p> Merchant sailors come off the sea loaded down with loot and cars. Already four of every five cars is a used Japanese sedan, and another 260 arrive daily, all with the standard Japanese right-hand drive, creating a traffic hazard of murderous proportions on the hilly, potholed streets. </p> <p> The Russian economy has made some gains in recent weeks, with inflation down to about 17 percent a month and new pledges by the Government and the Central Bank to get better control over the budget deficit, the issuing of credits and the inflation rate. </p> <p> Those pledges have secured a new agreement between the Government and the International Monetary Fund intended to provide $3 billion to finance the Russian budget deficit. The financing is aimed at reducing sharply the amount of domestic credits issued by the Central Bank and the inflation they cause, Russian officials and Western diplomats say. </p> <p> In an effort to speed aid to Russia, Moscow and the International Monetary Fund will announce an agreement soon under which Russia will receive $1.5 billion in aid within the next few weeks in exchange for promises to control inflation, fund officials and advisers to Russia said today. </p> <p> The agreement, to be announced in the next few days, is expected to provide a total of $3 billion in loans to Russia within four to five months and is aimed at helping President Boris N. Yeltsin transform Russia into a market economy. </p> <p> Nine of the 15 former Soviet republics, including Russia, today signed a declaration of intent to form an economic union to try to restore cohesion to their ruptured relationships. </p> <p> While the agreement is only a declaration of intent, it was praised by President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia as a "turning point" in the Commonwealth of Independent States, the loose, 10-member group formed after the Soviet Union collapsed. </p> <p> Providing an extraordinarily frank glimpse of struggles in the Government to stabilize the economy, the Finance Minister directed criticism tonight at his Cabinet colleagues, at the persistence of "pseudo-Soviet thinking" and at the "financial tourism" of Western business executives who visit but do not invest. </p> <p> The official, Boris G. Fyodorov, 35, is considered the leading economic reformer in the Government and the most tireless proponent of financial and monetary discipline. But he described a Government in which his small band of Westernized economists are fighting a constant battle against colleagues who wish to restore many of the plans and price controls of the Soviet era, in which they were trained. </p> <p> The people at the St. Petersburg Inspectorate for the Preservation of Monuments have mixed feelings about what is going on these days at the Yusupov Palace, a mansion on the Moika Canal where Grigory Rasputin, the Siberian monk who wielded a sinister influence over the family of the last czar, met a grisly end in December 1916. </p> <p> Once the exclusive preserve of the Trade Union of Education Workers, the mansion in the last two years has opened its doors wide to the public -- maybe too wide, some say. Tour groups tramp through the basement, where the famous murder took place, while upstairs elegant rooms, recently restored, are made available for concerts and private parties, including a New Year's Eve gala organized by NeimanMarcus, the Texas-based department store. </p> <p> A confidential report on nuclear energy in the former Soviet bloc says it would be economically feasible to close 25 of the most dangerous nuclear reactors during the next few years and replace them with gas-fired power plants. </p> <p> But the report says the former Communist countries oppose such a plan and want to keep their nuclear plants going as long as possible, a choice that could prove more dangerous and costlier for the West. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration said today that a $4 billion international fund it proposed to help Russian state enterprises convert to private businesses would have to be shrunk because Japan and the Western European allies are too squeezed for cash to join. </p> <p> "We are doing some serious arm-twisting on the Japanese and Europeans to try to salvage as much as possible," a senior Administration official said. "People understand that the idea is not a bad idea, but they keep saying to us: Where are we going to come up with this dough?" </p> <p> The United States is pressing the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations to set up an office in Moscow to coordinate Western aid, but Britain and France oppose the idea, Western officials said this week. </p> <p> The goal of the plan is to give the seven nations a more effective and aggressive role in distributing aid to Russia, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. </p> <p> The lobby of the Metropole, Moscow's lovingly restored grand hotel a few blocks from Red Square, is almost deserted on this gray spring afternoon. That's just fine with Jeffrey D. Sachs, a boyish-looking 38-year-old Harvard professor who is now probably the most important economist in the world. He has appropriated a cluster of comfortable armchairs for a meeting with two members of his team, Americans who work full time in Russia. </p> <p> The agenda is Russia's safety net or, more precisely, whether unemployed workers will be able to make ends meet. Russia is plunging out of Communism, if not directly into a capitalist free market. Whether this huge, humiliated nation will stoically bear the pain of the transition is far from clear, and the strength of the safety net could make the difference. </p> <p> The three main Slavic states that dominated the old Soviet Union and effectively dissolved it in December 1991 have decided to press ahead with an economics and customs union, including coordinated economic policies. </p> <p> Last weekend, after secretive meetings in a rest house outside Moscow, the Prime Ministers of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine announced agreement on the principles of economic integration and a "single economic space," with a draft treaty embodying that agreement to be ready by Sept. 1. </p> <p> In the face of growing popular dissatisfaction and loud criticism from the Westernized market-oriented wing of his Government, President Boris N. Yeltsin issued a decree today sharply watering down a drastic currency revision that the Central Bank announced on Saturday. </p> <p> As Russians stood complaining in long lines from St. Petersburg to Khabarovsk to exchange their suddenly invalid pre-1993 ruble banknotes at state savings banks that had inadequate supplies of new notes, even Mr. Yeltsin's political rival, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, usually an ally of the bank, opposed the change, calling it confiscatory and threatening to reconvene Parliament to overturn it. </p> <p> Traveling in Russia recently as a writer, I came quickly to feel like a spy -- not a foreign agent for America, but a spy for each emerging social class to the others.  Members of the Russian mafia -- the organized-crime circle -- were fascinated to hear that intellectuals think the criminal class exerts social influence. The intelligentsia were obsessed with the greed of the new rich businessmen, whom they blame for the end of heroic idealism. A return to the Orthodox Church has left homosexuals worried about repressive neo-conservatism; nightclub owners are wondering whether the artists who flourished underground can survive in the new daylight. Politicians wonder whether power will remain in the hands of government or will devolve to these chaotic elements. Within all these social strata, the changes are most clear among members of the younger generation. </p> <p> Overall, their outlook is harsh indeed. According to an article in the mainstream newspaper Argumenty i Fakty in April, "Young Russian malcontents are considering suicide every second." One-third want to leave the country. Since 1989, the birth rate has dropped 30 percent, as discouraged young people choose not to have children. Even so, some young Russians are plunging ahead with often-decadent abandon to find freedom, wealth and power, defying the timidity, and idealism, of the older generation. </p> <p> Revising its aid proposals for the former Soviet Union, the Clinton Administration has told the Senate that it wants to get American companies more involved in efforts to build a private sector and to expand money allocated for republics other than Russia. </p> <p> The new proposal came in the form of a request for $2.5 billion in appropriations sent to the Senate Thursday night and intended to carry out the Administration's aid pledges for Russia and the other former republics of the Soviet Union. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration is planning to use the economic meeting in Tokyo this week to announce the successful conclusion of talks among European allies and Japan on providing new aid to Russia for economic reforms. </p> <p> The $500 million that the allies have agreed to provide includes a $125 million commitment from the United States, $120 million from Japan and $80 million from Germany, Administration officials said. </p> <p> A serious split emerged in the Russian Government today over the sudden decision by the Russian Central Bank to declare all pre-1993 ruble bank notes invalid as of midnight tonight, with senior Finance Ministry officials making a personal protest to President Boris N. Yeltsin at a Kremlin meeting. </p> <p> The decision, which has thrown Russians into panic as they scurry to unload old bank notes, was made on Saturday without consultation with the Finance Ministry, which was only notified at the last minute, a senior economic adviser to the Government said. </p> <p> Western officials and economists today criticized the decision by Russia's Central Bank to withdraw old bank notes from circulation, saying it could unfairly confiscate currency from many Russians and severely hurt small businesses, a group that the West is eager to help. </p> <p> The move to reduce the number of rubles in circulation is officially aimed at controlling the money supply and reducing inflation, but some officials and economists interviewed said the move might ultimately help drive up prices by undermining faith in Russia's currency and Central Bank. </p> <p> It has become clear that new Western credits are no longer a remedy for Russia, but a drug helping maintain an unfit system, one accustomed to continual budget overruns and fiscal irresponsibility. </p> <p> In 1992, Western countries rescheduled more than $7 billion of Russia's debt and granted it $13.3 billion in new credits, which financed more than half of Russia's hard-currency imports. </p> <p> In the last two months, the first glimmers of progress have appeared in two central issues for Russia: slowing inflation and stabilizing the ruble. Feeling encouraged, industrial countries pressed ahead with a $43 billion package of aid to help Russia make the transition to a market economy. </p> <p> But today, after drastic currency controls were imposed over the weekend by the Central Bank and then eased by the Government, some diplomats are expressing new concern about the fragility of economic reform and the future of aid. </p> <p> President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia announced today that they will meet in Moscow for their second formal summit conference, probably later this year. </p> <p> The two men conferred for more than an hour today after the conclusion of the summit meeting of the leaders of the world's seven leading industrial democracies and pronounced themselves pleased with the outcome of Mr. Yeltsin's appearance at the meeting. </p> <p> Invited as the extra man at the annual meeting of leaders of the Group of Seven major industrial nations, President Boris N. Yeltsin will come bearing news that Russia's wrenching economic transformation has made notable progress since a Western aid package was assembled three months ago in Tokyo. </p> <p> Inflation, which was running as high as 30 percent a month last winter and looked as if it might be hurtling toward the hyperinflation rate of 50 percent, has cooled to less than 20 percent, and Finance Minister Boris G. Fyodorov predicted that the figure could fall below 15 percent in the near future. </p> <p> Apparently in a move to reassert control over the money supply, Russia's central bank announced today that with the Government's support it was withdrawing all bank notes issued before the beginning of the year. </p> <p> The announcement in the middle of a summer weekend set off panic, with many Russians dashing to banks and shops to try to exchange or spend their old notes before Monday, when they will no longer be valid. </p> <p> The struggle and drift in Russian economic policy was particularly vivid today, as President Boris N. Yeltsin convened an expanded meeting of his divided Government in the Kremlin while the Parliament was busy suspending his privatization program for the second time in a month. </p> <p> As a measure of the state of affairs, it was considered a victory for the market-oriented wing of the Government that the industrialist Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, did not throw his support behind a Soviet-style effort by the Economics Ministry to resurrect the essentials of centralized planning. </p> <p> Finance ministers here for a meeting of the International Monetary Fund gave Russia a two-pronged message today: they support President Boris N. Yeltsin in his showdown with Parliament, but they want him to move faster to reduce inflation and reform the economy. </p> <p> Voicing enthusiastic support for Mr. Yeltsin, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told the ministers today, "Our task in this unfolding drama is to reinforce reform and its standard-bearers." </p> <p> Western diplomats and economists today welcomed former Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar's return to government as a desperately needed bolstering of support for market-oriented policies in the badly divided administration. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin acted under considerable pressure from the United States and international lending institutions like the International Monetary Fund, the diplomats said. Some wondered whether Mr. Yeltsin was once more responding to a crisis by an essentially symbolic gesture. </p> <p> Fair game for Communist spies during the cold war, Germany has not let down its counterespionage defenses since the collapse of Communism in Europe. German counterspies have caught more agents in the last three years than during most of the time East Germany and the Soviet Union existed, the authorities say. </p> <p> "The Federal Republic of Germany remains one of the primary targets for foreign intelligence services," said the annual report issued late last month by its domestic security and counterintelligence service. "Simply because of its economic strength and its scientific-technical resources, it offers plenty of opportunities for espionage activities." </p> <p> The International Monetary Fund has decided to delay a $1.5 billion loan to Russia because of Moscow's failure to cut its inflation rate and carry out other promised reforms. </p> <p> But United States and fund officials said they were encouraged that the Russian Government has shown what they see as a stepped-up commitment to reform during the last few days, for instance in the appointment of former Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar as a First Deputy Prime Minister. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin said today that he was bringing Yegor T. Gaidar, the reformist economist who was forced out as Acting Prime Minister by opponents last December, back into the Government as First Deputy Prime Minister in charge of all economic matters. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin made the surprise announcement while fielding questions during a visit to Interior Ministry forces. He said that Mr. Gaidar had accepted and that the move would become official on Saturday. </p> <p> After 17 years of living and working amid the snows and volcanoes of the Kamchatka Peninsula on Russia's easternmost rim, Mikhail Akhmetov is calling it quits. He will head for the sunshine and fresh fruit of his native Nalchik in the Caucasus Mountains, nine time zones away. </p> <p> Mr. Akhmetov will join a reverse migration that is slowly stripping Russia's northern periphery of many of its best-trained settlers and forcing regions like Kamchatka, a wilderness of birch forests and tundra the size of Montana, to rethink their future. </p> <p> Finance ministers and central bank presidents of the world's seven leading industrial democracies expressed support today for Russia and for Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories, but the officials pledged no new aid for either. </p> <p> The ministers also reached no new plan to stimulate the sluggish world economy. American officials said this week that they were especially interested in increasing global economic growth through lower interest rates in Europe and Japan and possibly lower taxes in Japan. So the absence of any such deal was another sign that these periodic meetings play a dwindling role in international monetary policy. </p> <p> Many Russians still measure out their lives by the price of bread, a revered staple that traditionally has been subsidized at huge cost by the collectivist state. </p> <p> On Friday, however, with scarcely a flourish, the Government decided to end subsidies on bread, taking advantage of the state of emergency that President Boris N. Yeltsin declared after the disbanding of Parliament and a brief ensuing revolt. Moscow also tripled the price of a subway ride -- to 30 rubles, still only 2.5 cents. </p> <p> American officials expressed hope today that the defeat of President Boris N. Yeltsin's opponents in Moscow had swept aside the vestiges of the old Soviet system. But they said they remained unsure that the opening would make way for true democracy. </p> <p> With their vision of a democratic Russia still embodied almost solely in Mr. Yeltsin, the officials said they recognized that the path toward democratization remained littered with obstacles within Russian society and perhaps presented by the Russian President himself. </p> <p> For 18 months, President Boris N. Yeltsin complained that the Russian Parliament was blocking his Government's efforts to move the Russian economy toward a Western-style free market. </p> <p> Now that Mr. Yeltsin has complete control, he is widely seen as having an unprecedented and probably unrepeatable chance to stabilize and reform Russia's economy. This opportunity is especially important for the West, which has hinged more than $40 billion in aid to Russia on progress toward economic reform. </p> <p> The day that Boris Yeltsin climbed up on that tank a couple of years ago, the West cheered for joy, and made a great human and political error. It is embarrassing to think about now, it was so intellectually and politically callous, so we don't. </p> <p> For all their lives, the people imprisoned under Soviet Communism never read a free newspaper, voted in a free election, made a single free speech, or heard one. They lived in a state whose captives knew that it was dangerous even to think. </p> <p> The 30 pensioners dining on a free meal at the Center for Social Protection in Moscow's Kuzminki region were complaining loudly about life since the collapse of Communism, when the waitress interrupted them. </p> <p> "What are you griping about?" demanded Natasha, a stout 33-year-old already missing a few teeth. "You are old, your life is behind you, you already have what you need. We're the ones who are the castoffs of society. Just imagine, if you can, raising a child on 15,000 rubles a month. But then, nobody thinks of us." </p> <p> The referendum and elections worked out as I had planned: I, Boris Yeltsin, am now the most powerful Kremlin leader since Yuri Andropov, and -- at the same time -- I am the only hope of the Western world. </p> <p> Not an easy combination to bring about. First I had to show my democratic reformers -- mostly intellectuals who think me a brave simpleton -- how dependent on me they are. </p> <p> Suffering from layoffs and wages that have not kept pace with inflation, the voters of this industrial and agricultural center in southern Russia appear to be favoring candidates in the parliamentary election on Sunday who advocate a much slower transformation to a market economy. </p> <p> Most of the candidates have publicly distanced themselves from President Boris N. Yeltsin's policies, which have cut off or cut back credits to industry with the goal of forcing them to become more efficient or go out of business. Even Mayor Yuri V. Chekov, who is running for Parliament, declares himself an independent, although he is endorsed by Russia's Choice, the party allied with Mr. Yeltsin. </p> <p> In what may be a sign of a weakening of economic resolve after his electoral rebuff on Sunday, President Boris N. Yeltsin today granted new heavily subsidized loans that could aggravate the budget deficit and inflation. </p> <p> At the same time, after an extended debate, Mr. Yeltsin's Government approved the draft of a weaker, less centralized privatization program over objections from well-known reformers, including First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar and Privatization Minister Anatoly B. Chubais. </p> <p> While Russia continued its painfully slow counting of votes from Sunday's election, its biggest vote-getter, the acerbic nationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, offered today to play a responsible part in any new government. </p> <p> Appearing at a news conference in a black tuxedo, Mr. Zhirinovsky, who appears to have won nearly a quarter of the vote from a population angry with the price of change, was by turns reasonable and bombastic, promising to do nothing to destabilize the Government while he waits for a presidential election to be called. Willing to Wait </p> <p> Even if President Boris N. Yeltsin completes his five-year term in June 1996, Mr. Zhirinovsky said, "then my election to that post would be a nice present for my 50th birthday." </p> <p> Despite their confident public comments, President Clinton and senior officials in his Administration were "startled and shaken," one of them conceded today, by the results of Sunday's parliamentary voting in Russia. </p> <p> Several said that while it was not clear precisely how American policy would change toward Russia, the other former states of the Soviet Union and the former Soviet satellites, it was clear that the policy would have to be rethought. At a minimum, several officials said, Mr. Clinton will have to find some way to ease the exclusive identification of American policy in the region with the success of the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin. </p> <p> After a series of crises ranging from a civil war to the worst drought in 50 years, this small country on the southwestern edge of Russia has pushed its nationalist leaders aside, and the Government is trying to reform the economy. </p> <p> But severe energy shortages and still troubled relations with Moscow, this former Soviet republic's main oil supplier, threaten the market-oriented Government's plans as winter sets in and February elections approach. </p> <p> The big trade agreements of the past few months have prompted rejoicing in the United States, Latin America, Western Europe and Asia. But they will be of little value to the former Soviet republics and Eastern Europe, where the growing economic disparity with the rest of the world will sow the seeds of enormous regional violence if it is not corrected soon. </p> <p> The key to the economic plight of these nations is all too easy to overlook: the terrible instability of their currencies and the great difficulty of converting them to other currencies. Yet if the U.S. and the rest of world ignore the currency problems of the old Soviet bloc, we will be repeating the very mistakes that led to World War II -- and forgetting the lessons of the 1940's, which not only corrected these mistakes but also laid the basis for a world trading system and for the collapse of the Soviet empire. </p> <p> After the strong vote for the far right and far left, President Boris N. Yeltsin had a serious choice to make about the pace and kind of economic reform. But today, in his first post-election news conference, there was no indication he has made that choice. </p> <p> His decision to keep Yegor T. Gaidar, a current First Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the reformers, means the probable continuation of a Government so divided that it has been unable to pursue a consistent economic strategy. </p> <p> Two old women walked past, bent by age and thickly bundled in worn quilted cotton and huge felt boots, but moving surprisingly fast through the carpet of new snow. </p> <p> "So babushka, 'everyone to the elections,' right?" said a passer-by, invoking the old Soviet slogan that used to insure turnouts of 99 percent and better for an unopposed Communist slate. </p> <p> The sinister machinations of the Russian "mafia" was a hot topic in Moscow just before the parliamentary elections. </p> <p> Exactly what the word "mafia" means in Russia is not clear, but those who use the word seem to have in mind the brash entrepreneurs, slick wheeler-dealers and aggressive businessmen who have emerged, seemingly out of nowhere, to take advantage of the hesitant movement toward a free enterprise economy. </p> <p> Sometime soon after the anti-Communist revolution, a new mantra entered international life. </p> <p> The phrases "free-market economy" and "democracy" became chanted together, an inseparable formula. Without one, the other could not exist. In combination they were sung as the only answer to the future of Eastern Europe and Russia. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration's top Russia specialist said today that the surprisingly large support for foes of reform in Russia's parliamentary elections last week showed that there had been too much emphasis on remaking the economy of Russia and not enough on improving the daily lives of its people. </p> <p> Strobe Talbott, the State Department's Ambassador at Large for Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union, also said the United States was looking to other Russian reformers as well as President Boris N. Yeltsin to bring change to the troubled country, even if they were Mr. Yeltsin's political enemies. 'Shock Therapy' Has Failed </p> <p> While Mr. Talbott was characteristically cautious and noncommittal, his remarks illuminated an important shift in official American thinking: an admission, in effect, that the "shock therapy," the-faster-the-better approach to reform advocated by the West -- and until recently by Mr. Yeltsin -- has not worked. </p> <p> In another strong signal of a shift against economic reform after the Russian elections, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin was quoted today as scathingly accusing Westernized reformers in his own Cabinet of "poorly thought-out experiments" and a failure "to think about the people, for the sake of whom the reforms were started." </p> <p> Mr. Chernomyrdin said the Government would now focus less on tight monetary and spending controls, which would reduce Russia's high rate of inflation, and more on social protection and on state and private investment to create jobs. </p> <p> Vice President Al Gore appealed to Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany today to put aside any doubts about Russia's political stability and to speed up aid to the country. </p> <p> In a nearly two hour meeting at Mr. Kohl's home, Mr. Gore also raised the question of whether the International Monetary Fund should ease the inflation quotas put on Russia so the country can get aid faster to relieve its severe social and economic troubles. </p> <p> Insisting that they would not be deterred by political uncertainty, the United States and Russia formally joined as partners today on an international space station and announced that the first Russian astronaut would fly in the space shuttle Discovery in six weeks. </p> <p> While both sides had agreed to the basic space accord, the agreement today formally ended decades of rivalry between Moscow and Washington. </p> <p> Nearly two years after Russia began its great economic experiment, freeing prices as it moved toward a market economy, industrial production seems to have stopped falling and the ruble has become relatively stable against the dollar. </p> <p> Together with the privatization of important parts of state industry, these are considerable achievements as the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin approaches a crucial parliamentary election and constitutional referendum on Dec. 12. They mean that most Russians still have jobs, that their salaries are worth more in dollars, and that there are goods in the shops to buy, though often at prices that make Russians blanch. </p> <p> Russia's precipitate election campaign entered its home stretch today with blocs led by two old-time reform rivals leading the pack, but with a large clump of voters still undecided or altogether uninterested. </p> <p> Today was the last day that public-opinion polls could be published before the Dec. 12 election for a new Parliament, and they showed that Russia's Choice, led by Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar and tacitly backed by President Boris N. Yeltsin, still holds a commanding lead. </p> <p> Officials of the International Monetary Fund said today that they were considering loosening their conditions for releasing aid to Russia, but they also called on President Boris N. Yeltsin to spend more on the poor and less on propping up inefficient state industries. </p> <p> Responding to stinging criticisms that the fund has not been sensitive enough to Russia's hardships, officials held out the hope that easing conditions on aid would make economic reform more palatable to Russians. </p> <p> One curious aspect of Russia's first full-fledged election campaign is that the country's leading political figure, President Boris N. Yeltsin, has ostentatiously stayed aloof from the race, neither forming a party nor endorsing any of the 13 blocs competing for seats in Parliament. </p> <p> When Mr. Yeltsin did finally address the electorate on television this evening, it was to issue an impassioned plea to support his draft constitution, which has come under considerable fire for giving the President too much power. Unless the constitution is adopted, he warned, the new Parliament will collapse into new power struggles and Russia could again come to the brink of civil war. </p> <p> The President seemed almost disdainful of the race for Parliament, and his only advice to voters was to support "responsible and honest" candidates and not those filled with hate. </p> <p> You can't throw a snowball at the World Economic Forum in this ski resort without hitting a rejected Russian reformer. </p> <p> Early last week, Russia's reformist Finance Minister, Boris Fyodorov, walked into President Boris Yeltsin's office with a him-or-me ultimatum: Either fire the inflationary Central Bank chief, Viktor Gerashchenko, who was on a ruble-printing binge to prop up inefficient industry, or I quit. </p> <p> Back in the old Soviet days, an American-Soviet summit meeting was a time for the Kremlin's propaganda machine to go into overdrive with a torrent of shows, books and articles about the United States. </p> <p> No matter that most of it was tendentious stuff about the "Negro problem" or American "militarism" -- nobody listened to any of that. </p> <p> Two leading Western economists resigned today as advisers to the Russian Government, saying the "aims and policies" announced by Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin mean the end of fundamental economic reform. </p> <p> In response, Mr. Chernomyrdin's spokesman quoted him as saying the new course of reforms "of course contains elements of Western market economics, but mainly takes into account the special characteristics of our state, people and Russian traditions." </p> <p> In a sharp change of tone, the Clinton Administration's top specialist on Russia, testifying on Capitol Hill, sternly warned today that the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin must press full speed ahead with economic reforms or risk an inflation rate high enough to "topple governments, sometimes with the ugliest and most dangerous of results." </p> <p> Applying undisguised pressure on Russia after a Cabinet shuffle in Moscow that left foes of swift economic change in charge, Strobe Talbott, the Deputy Secretary of State-designate, told a Senate subcommittee that "gradual reform is a prescription for hyperinflation and economic collapse." </p> <p> A day after President Clinton left Moscow, carrying assurances of continued Russian market reforms, their architect, Yegor T. Gaidar, announced today that he was quitting the Government because he did not think that it would pursue a sensible economic policy. </p> <p> "I cannot serve in the Government and at the same time be in opposition to it," Mr. Gaidar said, citing recent decisions made without Cabinet approval that he said contradicted his efforts to stabilize the economy and bring the budget deficit under control. </p> <p> Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen told Russian leaders today that the United States is prepared to help speed up delivery of Western aid, but only after credible signs that Russia is restructuring its budget to phase out money-losing industries, to lower inflation and to better assist the unemployed. </p> <p> The mantra for President Clinton's visit, Treasury officials say, is: more Russian reform in return for more Western money more quickly. </p> <p> As the ruble plummeted to new lows and ordinary Russians lined up to exchange them for dollars, President Boris N. Yeltsin and his Prime Minister apparently failed to agree today on a new Government, leaving the future of the reformist Finance Minister in doubt. </p> <p> After six hours of talks, Mr. Yeltsin and his Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, left for their country houses, and a spokesman said they might meet again on Wednesday. Their inability to announce a new Government left a degree of suspense surrounding Finance Minister Boris G. Fyodorov, who has come to symbolize the fate of economic reform after the resignation Sunday of Yegor T. Gaidar. </p> <p> Russia's Finance Minister, who has come to represent Moscow's commitment to rapid economic reform, announced tonight that he was quitting the Government after President Boris N. Yeltsin named a new Cabinet that is expected to put higher priority on protecting industrial jobs than in fighting inflation. </p> <p> After four days of intense negotiations and financial panic that sent the ruble to new lows, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, announced the new Cabinet and declared, "the period of market romanticism is now over." </p> <p> Clinton Administration officials voiced serious concern today about the announced resignation of Russia's Finance Minister, Boris G. Fyodorov, an advocate of rapid economic reform, fearing his departure could slow Moscow's move to a market economy. </p> <p> American officials hesitated to express worry when another leading reformer, First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, resigned last Sunday. Trying to put the best face on that resignation, which came on the day President Clinton left Moscow after meeting President Boris N. Yeltsin, American officials said they were still confident that reforms would continue to move apace, in part because Mr. Fyodorov was still in place. </p> <p> At a time when serious questions are being raised about the course of Russian politics, a former Communist Party bureaucrat who has been Prime Minister for little more than a year is more often than not these days making decisions for President Boris N. Yeltsin. </p> <p> Still little known in the West, the official, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, was chosen in December 1992 by Mr. Yeltsin to serve as Prime Minister, when a hard-line revolt in Parliament forced him to drop Yegor T. Gaidar, who had been the architect of his economic reforms. Mr. Chernomyrdin, a stocky 55-year-old, was a compromise candidate -- the classic "centrist" to substitute for the highly provocative Mr. Gaidar. </p> <p> President Clinton came to this wintry capital today and embraced President Boris N. Yeltsin almost without qualification, despite the surprisingly strong nationalist, anti-Yeltsin revolt evident in the parliamentary elections on Dec. 12. </p> <p> On his first visit to Russia as President, Mr. Clinton and his top aides conceded that many people here had suffered acute economic privation in the transition from Communism to a free market. They spoke of the need for a redesigned net of social services to ease the pain. But they nonetheless pressed for a sustained or, in some areas, increased pace of reform. </p> <p> Less than a week before the NATO and Moscow summit meetings, the Administration is still groping for a coherent strategy as President Clinton prepares to embark on his most comprehensive and ambitious overseas trip. </p> <p> On Russia, the Administration retreated from the position outlined by Strobe Talbott, its leading Russia strategist, just two weeks ago that American policy is now to find a way to de-emphasize rapid economic change in favor of maintaining living standards. </p> <p> At the meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Moscow last week, the American business executives had a Protestant minister open their luncheon by delivering a prayer for the Russian economy. "Dear God," he intoned, "we pray for this land. For wise decisions. Do not let us lose hope." </p> <p> It was a fitting way to begin their session and a fitting summary of American economic diplomacy toward Russia today, which relies almost as much on prayer as on policy. </p> <p> It is not that there is no substance behind the American approach to Russia today. There is. And it is not that there is no money behind it, either. It is that no more money will be delivered, or make a substantive difference, unless President Boris N. Yeltsin puts together a viable, concrete plan to restructure his budget in a way that will curb inflation, end subsidies to unprofitable state industries and create a body of laws to support a free market. Bear Hugs and Vodka </p> <p> That was President Clinton's message to the Russian leader this week. It was sugarcoated in a number of ways, with many bear hugs and vodka toasts, but underneath there was always the same theme: "More money for Russia, more quickly, but only after more reform." </p> <p> In a strong indication that the Russian Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin is concerned about Western reaction to hisnew, more conservative Government, he met today with Boris G. Fyodorov, a reformer who would not accept a position in the new Cabinet, and told him to meet with President Boris N. Yeltsin on Monday. </p> <p> Mr. Fyodorov, the young Finance Minister who announced on Thursday that he was quitting, said today in an interview with Britain's Sky News television that his resignation as Finance Minister had not yet been accepted. He suggested there was a "1,000 to 1" chance he might remain in the Government, which would seem to require his promotion to Deputy Prime Minister. </p> <p> The poor relations between Ukraine and Russia, already tense over Ukraine's nuclear weapons and its inability to pay for Russian oil, are likely to be aggravated by the election on Jan. 16 of the first President of Crimea. </p> <p> A peninsula with balmy weather and a beautiful coast that juts into the Black Sea, Crimea is home to the Black Sea Fleet, an aging fleet of rusting ships that Ukraine and Russia continue to bicker over. </p> <p> When Elisabeth Rehn joined a televised debate among Finland's 11 presidential candidates last month, a questioner demanded to know what she was doing there. As the nominee of a tiny party composed mostly of Swedish-speaking Finns, Mrs. Rehn surely did not believe that she had a serious chance of winning, she was told. </p> <p> But this month she confounded political experts here by finishing a strong second in the first round of balloting. She is now the odds-on choice to win the runoff on Feb. 6 and become Finland's first woman to serve as president, after serving as the country's first female Defense Minister. </p> <p> While most Russians are not surprised to hear that criminal gangs seem to be taking over the country, a top-level Government report has laid out the gangs' reach in stark terms: organized crime has Russia by the throat, squeezing the life out of the fledgling private sector and holding the Government itself hostage. </p> <p> The report, prepared for President Boris N. Yeltsin, says 70 to 80 percent of private enterprises and commercial banks in major cities are forced to pay a tribute of 10 to 20 percent of their turnover to organized crime. </p> <p> After a long internal debate on Russian policy, President Clinton plans to go to Moscow next week urging continued tough economic reforms, officials said today. </p> <p> But they added that he will also offer some new ideas about how Western aid can be used to retrain Russian workers and cushion those left unemployed by economic change. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration's policy toward the former Soviet Union is being undermined, slowly but surely, by the takeover in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine by politicians advocating populist economics that American officials believe will lead to financial ruin and political turmoil. </p> <p> Only two weeks ago President Clinton traveled to Moscow and Minsk to deliver his message: more economic reform will lead to more Western aid. The leaders there nodded in agreement and the White House pronounced the visit a rousing success. </p> <p> Warning that the economy should not be left in the hands of "Red managers," Russia's Finance Minister rejected the entreaties of President Boris N. Yeltsin today and said he would not remain in the current Government. </p> <p> Boris G. Fyodorov, the young minister who had come to symbolize the future of Western-endorsed economic reform in Russia, predicted economic disaster, social explosions and Ukrainian-style hyperinflation as a consequence of the stated policies of Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin and the current Cabinet, which is dominated by Soviet-era managers who favor a slower, softer, subsidized transition to the market. </p> <p> American Presidents used to come here to treat with monolithic governments. On his arrival here this week, Bill Clinton found no real government at all, but rather two inchoate groups, one composed of reformers, the other a mix of "go slow" pragmatists and counter-reformers, all struggling for power, staggering into an unfathomable future. </p> <p> That put the young, inexperienced President on something of a diplomatic tightrope, fighting to keep his balance.  He did not fall off, but he did not make it across without a few wobbles this way and that. </p> <p> As President Boris N. Yeltsin gave President Clinton general assurances that economic change would proceed in Russia, its newly elected lower house of Parliament chose an anti-reform Communist stalwart as its Speaker today. </p> <p> The vote was another graphic reminder of the political realities facing Mr. Yeltsin once Mr. Clinton goes home. The victorious candidate, Ivan P. Rybkin, had the support of the Communist Party and its allies, and of the far-right nationalist party headed by Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky. </p> <p> As turmoil in the Government caused the ruble to fall to a new low against the dollar, President Boris N. Yeltsin today accepted the resignation of Yegor T. Gaidar, the architect of Russia's economic reforms, and negotiated to keep the Finance Minister, Boris G. Fyodorov, in his job. </p> <p> Mr. Gaidar resigned as a First Deputy Prime Minister and Economics Minister on Sunday, saying that the Government was not pursuing a rational economic policy and that his advice was being ignored by Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, a former manager of state industry. </p> <p> Negotiations over a new Russian Government continued in secret today, aggravating confusion and panic over the value of the ruble, which plunged another 6.5 percent in record trading, to a low of 1,607 to the dollar. </p> <p> In a brief report this evening, Interfax news agency said Finance Minister Boris G. Fyodorov, who has come to symbolize the future of economic reform, was reappointed Finance Minister in a partial agreement between President Boris N. Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. </p> <p> Since Russia's best-known economic reformers left the Government two weeks ago, there has much been casting about for signs of impending salvation or doom, enough to drive omen mavens back to bird entrails. </p> <p> The Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, has suddenly doubled his own inflation forecasts, now projecting a rate of 15 to 18 percent a month by the end of the year. The state energy sector warned of "a complete paralysis of economic activity" unless somebody started paying bills owed to it. The Economics Minister, Aleksandr N. Shokhin, talked of price controls and unpaid Government obligations of 7 trillion rubles ($4.4 billion), which Mr. Chernomyrdin vows to pay. </p> <p> The political rearrangement in Russia that began with the governmental reshuffling of mid-1992 has come to an end. The departure of the Cabinet's leading economic and political reformers last month erased all doubts. Until then, despite reactionary successes in the December parliamentary elections, it was possible to believe that the necessary reforms would continue, even if only in half-measures. But now it is clear that there will be no reforms, not even bad ones. </p> <p> Under the guise of social welfare policies, a planned economy will be re-established. Its executors will be Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his allies. President Boris Yeltsin has become merely decorative. If reform is to come, the work will be done by others. </p> <p> Two years after he set Russia on the road of economic and political reform, President Boris N. Yeltsin acknowledged today that the results had so far been disappointing and called on his opponents to join him in "a new political style" to move the country forward. </p> <p> "Let us at long last recognize that so far we have a weak state and that there is no elementary order in the country," Mr. Yeltsin said in a long-awaited address before a joint session of the newly elected Parliament. </p> <p> Finance officials of the seven most powerful industrial nations agreed today that economic aid to Russia could continue as soon as it began credible measures to control inflation and budget deficits, but that Moscow still had much to do, Western officials said. </p> <p> "We urged them to strengthen their efforts to bring inflation under control," Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said. "We told the Russians that a strong stabilization program is needed to trigger more support from the International Monetary Fund." </p> <p> Mikhail Zhvanetsky, Russia's most popular comedian, was recently asked about reform. </p> <p> "Much has changed, but nothing has happened," he began, but then paused in feigned confusion. "Or is it that much has happened, and nothing has changed?" </p> <p> The head of the International Monetary Fund complained today that his institution was being made a "scapegoat" by the Russians, Western governments and various experts for Russia's faltering economic reform effort. He said the responsibility lies with the Russians themselves. </p> <p> In a rare public defense, the I.M.F.'s managing director, Michel Camdessus, summoned reporters to deliver a feisty rebuttal to charges that his organization has been unrealistic or too slow in negotiating with the Russian Government the terms for more Western aid. </p> <p> After months of testy negotiations, the International Monetary Fund agreed tonight to provide Russia with a crucial $1.5 billion loan in exchange for a promise of new taxes and strict curbs on Government spending. </p> <p> The agreement, signed by Michel Camdessus, managing director of the I.M.F., and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, is essential to further economic support from Western governments and private businesses. Mr. Chernomyrdin has moved to impress foreign bankers as being much more willing to carry out tough economic measures. </p> <p> A crucial visit to Moscow this week by the head of the International Monetary Fund comes at an awkward time for the Russian Government. Three months into 1994, it has no approved budget and no political strategy for dealing with a backlog of economic problems that include a continuing production slump, a mounting internal debt and a wobbly hold on inflation. </p> <p> Thus, Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director, who arrived here today, will have few guideposts to help him decide whether Russia qualifies for a second loan of $1.5 billion from the fund and if negotiations for a long-term, standby agreement can begin in earnest. </p> <p> "Ton-ya! Tonya! Thank you! Thank you, Tonya!" </p> <p> Nina V. Kapralova, her lined face pressed to the frosty window of the bus, waved at her relatives standing outside at the Ivanovo bus station in central Russia's bone-shrinking cold. </p> <p> In the Clinton Administration's most vigorous defense of its Russia policy since last week's arrest of a C.I.A. agent on charges of spying for Moscow, Secretary of State Warren Christopher told a Congressional committee today that it was vital for Washington to support economic reform in Russia. </p> <p> Mr. Christopher also rejected charges that the Administration had backed the Russian Government too uncritically. He said the White House would not shrink from differing with Moscow when appropriate and warned Russia not to intervene in neighboringcountries except as part of an international effort. </p> <p> Those who suggest that because of its vast problems Russia should no longer be treated as a world power ignore an unpleasant but undeniable truth: Russia is the only nation in the world that can destroy the United States. Therefore Russia remains our highest foreign policy priority. </p> <p> The Russia I saw on this trip is a very different nation from the one I visited just one year ago. Optimism about the future is being replaced by pessimism. A strongly pro-American attitude has in many cases become disturbingly anti-American. Boris Yeltsin is still a political heavyweight but he is no longer a superman. When Russia was a dictatorship as part of the Soviet Union, a good relationship with the man at the top was all that was necessary. This is no longer enough. </p> <p> With far more pomp than substance, President Boris N. Yeltsin won approval today for a national peace pact with most of his political opponents. </p> <p> The treaty, signed in the Kremlin and broadcast to the nation on television, is supposed to guarantee that there will be no political violence before the next presidential elections, scheduled in 1996. That would give the Government two years of calm to focus on economic recovery. </p> <p> Outsiders often describe this special place led by a bold, idealistic Governor and his round table of young advisers, some Russian, others American, as a kind of free-market Camelot. </p> <p> Nizhny Novgorod, 250 miles east of Moscow, is the model for Russian capitalism. It is an internationally acclaimed experiment in privatization to which the best Russian and Western minds -- and the most American dollars -- have been applied. </p> <p> The decision by the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday to grant Russia a long-delayed $1.5-billion loan is important recognition that the new centrist Government, even without its best-known reformers, is working to slow inflation and stabilize the economy. </p> <p> But the decision is also a kind of prayer that the Government can adhere to its tight policy on spending despite growing pressure to ease up. In a politically volatile Russia, fear of unemployment looms larger than concern about inflation. </p> <p> The International Monetary Fund gave the Russian Government a much-sought vote of confidence today and approved a $1.5 billion loan that had been delayed for months because of fears that Moscow was not committed to aggressive economic reform. </p> <p> The move, which is expected to pave the way for billions of dollars more in aid to Russia, is surprising because just three months ago officials of the monetary fund were criticizing Russia's economic policies after several top supporters of free-market policies quit the Government. </p> <p> From the attic of the building that houses Kindergarten No. 392, there is a clear line of fire to the parking lot of the Krasnopresnensky Baths, 200 yards away. </p> <p> At 5:45 P.M. on April 5, Otari V. Kvantrishvili, keeping to routine, left the red-brick bathhouse surrounded by bodyguards. Sportsman, philanthropist, businessman, politician -- loved and admired by many for his support of war veterans, orphans and elderly athletes -- Mr. Kvantrishvili was also, as everyone seemed to know, a gangster, one of the most powerful bosses in Russia. At 46, he was a "thief in law," as the Russian phrase goes, a Godfather, one of the untouchables whom many Russians think are the country's real leaders. </p> <p> The future has finally arrived for Vitaly A. Chekhovich, but it has only made him sorry that he helped to bury the past. </p> <p> In the past, Mr. Chekhovich -- along with his mother, father, wife and all three brothers -- had unshakeably safe jobs here at the vast Zil Automobile Factory. They lived in Zil apartments and attended Zil schools. As babies, they spent their days at the Zil day care center, and when they were sick, Zil doctors saw them through their illnesses. </p> <p> In the early morning on a not quite empty city street a week ago, two men fired at each other with Kalashnikov assault rifles in a shootout that left one of the gunmen, a reputed member of organized crime, dead. </p> <p> As slayings go, it was not an unusual confrontation in the new, crime-ridden Russia -- except that the one who walked away was a young, reform-minded member of Parliament. </p> <p> Sounding more like an impassioned critic of the administration than its leader, President Boris N. Yeltsin attacked his Government today for dragging its feet on economic reform and failing to protect consumers and the poor. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin also said he would sign an agreement making Russia a member of the loose alliance known as the Partnership for Peace, which offers a kind of junior partnership in NATO to members of the former Warsaw pact. Russia delayed joining, insisting that as a former superpower it should have a more important role than other, smaller countries. </p> <p> Sounding more like an impassioned critic of the administration than its leader, President Boris N.

Kuchma, shocked nationalists, who fear he will push Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit. He denies any such intention but he must deal quickly with a deepening split between nationalistic western Ukraine and the Russian-speaking eastern part of the country. </p> <p> As far as summit talks go, the meeting here of the leaders of seven major industrial democracies is a rather strange gathering for one simple reason: It has very little potential to do good, in large part because all seven countries already have economies growing faster than at any time in years. They really are not that broke and don't need much fixing. </p> <p> But this meeting has significant potential to do bad, given the nervous state of world financial markets. The dollar's recent plunge against the yen and the German mark has roiled the currency markets, and uncertainty about the future of exchange and interest rates has global bond and stock markets on edge. </p> <p> Nearly two years ago, Russia embarked on the most crucial part of its effort to become a market economy: selling the property of a state that once owned everything and thus founding a nation of property owners with a stake in the success of economic reform. </p> <p> When the end of price controls wiped out savings, the Government chose to conjure up a middle class by giving away most state property, issuing 144 million vouchers free to every Russian to turn into shares. </p> <p> At long last, after 20 years of exile and a two-month rail trip across the troubled country that expelled him, Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn, Russia's mournful sage, returned to his nation's capital tonight. </p> <p> More than a thousand people, kept quietly at their distance by dozens of armed riot police, waited in the gray rain at Yaroslavl station to greet the 75-year-old writer who has savaged the current state of the country with almost as much intensity as he used when attacking Communism. </p> <p> Driven by equal doses of panic and greed, thousands of investors swarmed stock exchanges, offices and the headquarters of Russia's largest stock fund today, desperately trying to sell the company's shares, which have lost half their value in less than a day. </p> <p> With at least five million shareholders, the company, MMM, had become the most visible, and aggressive symbol of the rowdy new capitalism here, churning profits seemingly out of air, and turning everyone from penny- pinching grandmothers to college kids into stock market addicts. </p> <p> The urban veneer of this small industrial town is melting away. Chickens and goats roam the courtyards of huge Soviet apartment complexes, and cucumber and potato plants, not begonias, sprout out of window boxes and kitchen gardens. Nerekhta's factory workers have not been paid for months, and many are turning into citified subsistence farmers. </p> <p> Survival tips, instead of gossip, now dominate the town's small talk. "We grow our own food and we borrow from my mother's pension check," is how Galina Razzhivina, 39, a bookkeeper, described her household accounts. She and her husband, Mikhail, 36, work at the largest local plant, known simply as the Mechanical Factory, and neither has received a salary since May. </p> <p> "Do not spit out bones and other such things onto your plate." </p> <p> "Do not describe your illnesses at the table." </p> <p> A year ago, President Boris N. Yeltsin announced that he was preparing a "September barrage" against his sworn opposition in the Russian congress. By October, the metaphor had turned real, with tanks shelling the Parliament building. </p> <p> This August, there is an eerie stability. Monthly inflation is down to 6 percent compared with 26 percent a year ago. Salaries are worth more with the ruble stronger, and consumer spending is up. There is consensus on economic policy under Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who has adopted the tight-money policies he criticized in January. Mr. Yeltsin appears more energetic, the new Parliament is behaving itself and a divided opposition is apparently looking more toward 1996 elections than to counterrevolution in the streets. </p> <p> Strange things are happening in this graceful port on Russia's Asian frontier. A popular Korean takeout place has opened at the corner of Leo Tolstoy and Kim Yu Chen Streets. Women are wearing cotton sundresses bought from Chinese salesmen who live across the border, 20 miles away. A visitor from Seattle has set up an espresso bar. </p> <p> And at the top of the city's Intourist Hotel, part of a chain that in most Russian cities still seems about as innovative as an old Communist Party boss, Japanese businessmen perform karaoke and eat Tokyo-quality sushi (while paying for it with fistfuls of yen.) </p> <p> They shot it out at noon, not long after a hard summer rain had turned the city roads to mud. By the time the turf battle for one of Siberia's wildest outposts had ended, two gang leaders lay dead, six others were on their way to the hospital, and this untamed city -- filled with enough strivers, gamblers, con men and thieves to make Dodge City seem like Larchmont -- had taken one step closer to anarchy. </p> <p> "This has always been a crazy place but it sure is getting wilder," said Rima Yakovleva, a 28-year-old fur trader whose friend was killed in the shootout this month. "When people say freedom is dangerous in Russia I think I know what they mean. Because no place is freer or more dangerous than Siberia." </p> <p> Suggesting that it will take more than democracy to chase intrigue from the Kremlin, one of President Boris N. Yeltsin's closest aides asserted today that an "unseen struggle" was under way among Mr. Yeltsin's advisers over his political future. </p> <p> "A struggle is going on for a democratic president, practically speaking, for the next term of Russia's history," the Russian President's press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov, told the Interfax News Agency in an interview released this evening. "All the rest are emotions and the dust of political sideshows." </p> <p> The sleek new international air terminal here is filled each day with tourists and business investors flashing passports at border guards who sit behind high-tech glass booths, watching as the travelers breeze past customs with a wave. </p> <p> Only an hour's flying time to the east, at the dilapidated Borispol Airport in Kiev, the scene could not be more different, as weary passengers line up to purchase a piece of paper entitling them to stand in another line to buy a visa. Then they wait in still a third line to appear before cell-like booths containing immigration inspectors trained by the Soviet Union's K.G.B., who then turn them out to face a gamut of customs forms and suitcase searches. The whole process routinely takes two hours, just like in the old Communist days. </p> <p> When Boris N. Yeltsin arrives in the United States this weekend, America will witness the return of a salesman. The Russian leader aims to do statesmanly things, of course. He will address the United Nations General Assembly. He will hold a summit meeting with President Clinton. But mostly, in business meetings in New York, Washington and Seattle, Mr. Yeltsin hopes to convince American executives that Russia is a blue-chip investment. </p> <p> "His personal charm can do a lot," said Georgi A. Satarov, an aide to Mr. Yeltsin. "The American businessmen will tell him what are the necessary conditions for investment and our President will explain that such changes are already happening." </p> <p> The fevered days of autumn have descended heavily upon the farmers of Russia. An unusually cold summer stunted their crops and late rains nearly washed them away. Now the frosts are only a few weeks off, and if they come any sooner the nation will suffer its worst harvest in three decades. </p> <p> "A lot in our country depends on the weather this autumn," Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin told a German television reporter recently, voicing the common concern that a particularly poor harvest will hasten the effects of an already visible farm crisis. "What happens in the fields also has its effect on the political climate." </p> <p> An increasingly disquieting feature of Russian politics is President Boris Yeltsin's ambiguous attitude toward integration with the former Soviet republics. </p> <p> Big unanswered questions hover in the air. With which members of the Commonwealth of Independent States -- if any -- should Russia integrate? How? On what basis? With what goals? And with what consequences for Russia, those republics and the rest of the world? </p> <p> Ukraine, whose economy has nosedived since independence three years ago, won pledges for hundreds of millions of dollars in international financial support today to prop up the market-oriented reforms of its new President, Leonid D. Kuchma. </p> <p> Mr. Kuchma, the 55-year-old former head of a missile factory who is making his first foreign trip since his election in July, said that as a result of the pledges, he sees a "stable, economically powerful, democratic and independent Ukraine, which will be integrated into the world's political and economic system." </p> <p> After a strong speech to Parliament by the Prime Minister defending an austere draft budget for 1995, the Russian Government survived a vote of no-confidence today in the lower house. </p> <p> Of the 450 deputies, 194 voted against the Government, 32 votes short of the required majority of 226. There were 54 votes against the no-confidence motion, while 55 deputies abstained and 147 deputies did not even show up to vote. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin moved quickly today to try to calm Russians and restore confidence in his Government after Tuesday's extraordinary and embarrassing run on the ruble, which lost more than 25 percent of its value against the dollar. </p> <p> While the financial elements to stop the plunge were put into place Tuesday night -- helping the ruble to recover today to 3,736 against the dollar from Tuesday's close of 3,926 -- Mr. Yeltsin also moved politically. He dismissed the acting Finance Minister, Sergei Dubinin, who had little responsiblity for the run on the ruble; called the Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, home from vacation, and asked Parliament to dismiss the head of the central bank, Viktor V. Gerashchenko, a long-time target of market-oriented reformers. </p> <p> Parliament postponed any vote on the fate of Mr. Gerashchenko, who was silent on the ruble's collapse today, but lawmakers called for a vote of confidence in the Government for Oct. 21. </p> <p> In time-honored Moscow fashion, Mr. Yeltsin also ascribed what is being called "Black Tuesday" to sabotage by unidentified enemies and speculators, and he ordered his National Security Council to work with the secret police to investigate. One Government official even called for an "unmasking trial," the phrase used for the show trials that defined the purges of the Stalin era. </p> <p> But rather than the work of some secret conspiracy, Tuesday's events seemed to result from a confluence of factors, and traders who saw an opportunity took it. Western diplomats, brokers and business executives said today that a correction in the value of the ruble had been inevitable, if badly controlled. They said the Russian inflation rate remained tolerable and that the panic would not have a lasting effect on investor confidence. </p> <p> "I hope there won't be any re-evaluations on the part of investors," said Maksim Boyko, director of the Russian Privatization Center. "But this whole episode underscores the fragility of the stabilization achieved in 1994. The Central Bank should share at least part of the blame." </p> <p> Reasons cited to help explain Tuesday's panic included currency speculation, inflationary expectations and a failure of the Government and central bank to act quickly enough to control the market. </p> <p> After this summer's injection of credits into agriculture and industry, the Government and the central bank have made a coordinated effort to allow the ruble to adjust to higher inflation by slipping gradually from the 2,000 or so to the dollar of early this summer to about 3,000 or even 3,500 to the dollar, the rate at which the 1995 budget is figured. </p> <p> Although Russians have enjoyed a relatively low inflation rate since August 1993, when inflation stood at 26 percent a month, the monthly rate has increased from about 4 percent in June to about 8 percent in September. (The monthly rate in the United States in August was three-tenths of a percent, about average for recent months.) </p> <p> Since there is normally a three-month lag here between the release of new credits and an increase in the inflation rate, the estimated 7 trillion rubles of credits issued in July and August, and perhaps 3 trillion more issued in September, will continue to keep inflation running higher. In response to this expectation of continuing price increases, traders have been buying dollars, which has pushed the ruble down for three weeks now. </p> <p> During the last three months, the Russian Central Bank has spent $2 billion of its reserves of Western currency to support and stabilize the ruble. Wary of spending too much, the bank announced last month that it would lessen its support of the ruble in the foreign exchange markets. On Monday and Tuesday, the bank bought few rubles, doing so only late on Tuesday to prevent the ruble from crashing past the 4,000 to the dollar. </p> <p> With Mr. Chernomyrdin on vacation, the Government seemed paralyzed and said nothing. Only after trading ended on Tuesday -- followed by a reportedly stormy Government meeting -- did Mr. Gerashchenko of the central bank announce a sharp rise in short-term interest rates to make ruble holdings more attractive and declare that the bank would support the ruble at the start of trading today. </p> <p> But with outstanding credits, unpaid salaries and a significant budget deficit to finance, economists and diplomats say, the Government had wanted a weaker ruble so that it would take fewer dollars to pay for it all. A weaker ruble also helps protect Russia's domestic industry by making imports more expensive, a demand that is frequently made by farm and industrial lobbies. </p> <p> During a parliamentary debate today, Mr. Dubinin said that the panic was directly linked to recent subsidies to agriculture and defense industries. "Now we have to decide what we want -- either stabilization of finances with lower inflation or further subsidies to bankrupt enterprises," he said. If the latter, "the ruble will continue to fall." </p> <p> Adding to the panic on Tuesday, bankers said, was a successful effort by a group of commercial banks, hurting from bad loans made when inflation was much higher, to manipulate the rules of the Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange, or Micex, where the ruble is traded. </p> <p> As one board member explained it, banks have been allowed to buy dollars and put up the rubles to cover their purchase two days later, a common international practice. But numerous banks, he said, bought dollars and then delayed payment up to four days, waiting until Tuesday night, when the ruble was at its lowest, to cover their purchases. </p> <p> Now the exchange will return to the old method of requiring money to be deposited before any trade is approved, he said, to discourage currency speculation. </p> <p> Jannik Lindbaek, executive vice president of the International Finance Corporation, a part of the World Bank, said today that the last few days would not change the fundamental attractiveness of Russia as a place for foreign investment. </p> <p> "Interest in investing here is definitely a new trend, and it's not a blip on the radar screen," Mr. Lindbaek said. "In this kind of environment, one should expect the currency market to be volatile. If we should go to hyperinflation, that would be different. But the stabilization policy of the Government is correct and necessary, and it is in fact taking hold." </p> <p> Average Russians, who saw prices for imported goods and even some domestic items zoom up during the course of a day, offered opinions ranging from imminent ruin to bemused shrugs. </p> <p> Olga, a world-weary 24-year-old who works at the Voyazh kiosk in central Moscow, where a pack of Marlboros went from 1,900 rubles to 2,500 rubles and a Snickers bar from 1,000 rubles to 1,500 in hours, said: "Of course we've hiked our prices. But no one's complaining except the grannies." </p> <p> Leonid Abalkin, a well-known reform economist of the Gorbachev period, said people trusted the dollar more than their leaders. "In contrast to the Russian Government," he said, "the U.S. dollar will not let you down or deceive you." </p> <p> Irina, who sells soaps and cosmetics at the Kabul department store nearby, said they had nearly doubled prices overnight, and there were fewer customers than usual. "We understand what has happened better than anyone," she said. "We understand it with our pockets." </p> <p> With higher short-term interest rates and intervention by the Russian Central Bank, the ruble bounced back strongly today, ending at 2,994 to the dollar, slightly higher than it was before the collapse on Tuesday. </p> <p> But the crisis leaves scars and points to deeper insecurities within the Russian economy and political leadership. While there is considerably more stability than a year ago, when tanks were firing at the Parliament and monthly inflation was over 20 percent a month, there is continuing fragility as well. </p> <p> A year after ordering tanks to crush a parliamentary rebellion, President Boris N. Yeltsin said today that Russia was moving toward economic and political stability. He promised to maintain deflationary economic policies at least until the presidential election in June 1996. </p> <p> At a news conference exactly one year after tanks fired on the Russian Parliament, Mr. Yeltsin also promised to encourage private investment, "move a bit faster on economic reform" and pursue a strong Russian role in international affairs. </p> <p> The Great Game was what Kipling called the long struggle between the Russian and British empires over Central Asia. </p> <p> The great game these days is the struggle of the Russian Government to get loans out of the International Monetary Fund to bail out its budget. </p> <p> Surrounded by rusting machinery, piles of coal and the murmurs of colleagues trooping sullenly toward the Komsomol mine shaft for the day's second shift, Vyacheslav V. Chibisov grew angry explaining how he had become a victim of Russia's economic upheaval rather than a beneficiary. </p> <p> With demand for coal collapsing, Moscow has told Mr. Chibisov and Komsomol's 650 other workers that the mine will be closed within 18 months, a casualty of the Government's plan to slash the $2 billion it pays to keep mines open, even the most uneconomical ones. </p> <p> The ruble suffered its steepest one-day plunge in value today, forcing the Russian Government to step in with a plan to bolster the currency's value and avoid lapsing into further economic instability. </p> <p> After a day of extraordinary turmoil in the Russian financial markets in which the ruble lost more than 25 percent of its value against the dollar, the Government acted to defend its credibility as fears grew that its hard-won gains against inflation could be reversed. </p> <p> As many as 40,000 children and adults will contract diphtheria in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union this year because of a shortage of vaccine there, United Nations health specialists said today. </p> <p> The specialists, from the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund, said the majority of cases were being reported from Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. </p> <p> Confidence in Russia's economic policy took another blow today when the market-minded Economics Minister resigned in response to the appointment of a new Finance Minister. </p> <p> Aleksandr N. Shokhin, the Economics Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, stepped down after President Boris N. Yeltsin gave the finance post to Vladimir G. Panskov, a Soviet-era budget specialist who spent several months in prison before bribery charges against him were dropped this year. </p> <p> Russia lost one weak Finance Minister recently but gained another, causing a Deputy Prime Minister to resign in protest. But today the Government's strongest market-minded reformer, Anatoly B. Chubais, was elevated to First Deputy Prime Minister, while the Prime Minister promised to continue a tough fight against inflation. </p> <p> Does all this Kremlin maneuvering matter? It does, of course, especially for the economy, and for the level of confidence of those who are thinking about lending or investing in Russia. </p> <p> After 13 votes over three days last week, the Russian Parliament finally approved the first reading of a tight 1995 budget. But the real battle over spending limits is still to take place, the Russian military action in Chechnya could bust the budget and the Government has brought Western aid into question by reneging on promises to remove controls on domestic energy prices. </p> <p> The decision on energy was particularly worrisome, senior Western officials said, because it marked a significant loss for economic reformers inside the Cabinet after the sudden intervention of Gen. Aleksandr V. Korzhakov, President Boris N. Yeltsin's security chief. </p> <p> Republican leaders in Congress are planning a tough new approach that treats foreign aid much like welfare: as a multibillion-dollar handout that needs to be overhauled and cut. </p> <p> In mapping strategy for the foreign aid budget, which is $13.7 billion this year, the Congressional Republicans want to focus on advancing the United States' national security and economic interests rather than what they say is an entitlement program for poor nations. Many of them talk about using their new majority to cut foreign aid by 15 to 20 percent. </p> <p> The United States and Russia talked past each other today. </p> <p> In intense meetings aimed at repairing the deteriorating relationship between their countries, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev could not agree on how to resolve Russia's war in the rebel region of Chechnya or how to bridge the gaps on other issues. </p> <p> Economic prospects around the world look better this year than last. The decision by several large countries to sell off Government-controlled industries is one big engine of growth. Yet deficits, inflation and joblessness keep hampering the pace of recovery in many countries. </p> <p> For many nations, 1994 was a turnaround year as they began pulling out of recession. Some of the hottest economies, and targets of foreign investment, emerged in once-overlooked markets of Southeast Asia and Latin America. </p> <p> Russia's Foreign Minister assured Secretary of State Warren Christopher of his country's commitment to democracy and market reform and its determination to negotiate a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Chechnya, but did not say what concrete steps his country intended to take, senior Administration officials said tonight. </p> <p> The sweeping but vague assurances by Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev came during a three-hour dinner with Mr. Christopher that opened two days of intense discussions to repair a relationship between the two countries that was declining even before Russia's military offensive in the breakaway region of Chechnya. </p> <p> As Russian troops enter the bombed-out center of Grozny, the capital of the breakaway Chechen republic, this has inescapably become Boris Yeltsin's war. It has gravely stained his presidency and damaged his reputation, and with elections scheduled 18 months from now, he is increasingly seen as a lame duck. </p> <p> If Mr. Yeltsin's nose operation on the eve of the invasion, Dec. 10, was an effort to hide from direct responsibility for Chechnya -- or, as some liberal democrats here suggest, without any evidence, the Russian President was pushed into war unwittingly -- he has identified himself with it now. And it is not too soon to look at the likely aftermath. </p> <p> Under fire for strongly backing President Boris N. Yeltsin during the Chechnya crisis, Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced a modest change today in policy, warning Mr. Yeltsin that he could lose Washington's support if he forsakes democracy or free markets. </p> <p> Mr. Christopher seemed to put new conditions on American support for the Russian leader. Appearing on the NBC News program, "Meet the Press," he said, "Our concern is for reform in Russia. We'll continue to support President Yeltsin as long as he is moving in the right direction." </p> <p> A round of talks between Russia and the International Monetary Fund about a $6.25 billion loan has ended without agreement, but officials from both sides said they are hopeful that another round expected before the end of the month will succeed. </p> <p> Russia is counting on the loan to help fill a big gap in its 1995 budget. In return, the fund, which acts as the fiduciary agent for the big Western industrialized nations, wants a budget program that will help stabilize Russia's overheating economy. </p> <p> Vyacheslav and Tatyana Shapkin, Russians born in Kazakhstan, have had enough. The state collective farm where they live, 62 miles north of here, has not paid them in six months. They are selling everything they own. </p> <p> They are doing what 300,000 other ethnic Russians in Kazakhstan did in 1994; they are moving back to a Russia they barely know. </p> <p> Vigorous, opinionated and deeply frustrated, the last Communist leader of the Soviet Union floats across the political landscape like a restless ghost, unable to make his presence felt. </p> <p> Mikhail S. Gorbachev's name is not even mentioned in most surveys of voters' favorite politicians. He complains that national television declines his requests for air time. </p> <p> In a concession to the International Monetary Fund, President Boris N. Yeltsin has signed a series of decrees intended to increase fiscal discipline and reduce widespread corruption, Russian officials said today. </p> <p> The monetary fund is in the last stage of negotiating a $6.2 billion standby loan that is contingent on Moscow's commitment to stabilize its economy and keep its budget deficit within agreed limits in an effort to cut inflation here. </p> <p> In a development that could have important implications for economic change in neighboring Russia, Ukraine is expected to borrow close to $1.5 billion from the International Monetary Fund later this month. </p> <p> Ukraine's representative at the I.M.F. in Washington, Oleh Havrylyshyn, and Anders Aslund, a Swedish economic adviser to President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine, confirmed in separate interviews yesterday that the Ukranian Government would sign a letter this week accepting the I.M.F.'s terms for the loan, which would be by far the largest the institution has given to any country of the former Soviet Union. Ukraine has 52 million people. </p> <p> IT'S 3 o'clock on a sunny April afternoon, and tens of thousands of parents know exactly where their children are. Here at Disneyland, the line for Pirates of the Caribbean is an hour long. But that's nothing: Splash Mountain will set you back 90 minutes. And somewhere, deep in the bowels of Adventureland, 10-year-olds are hunkering down for the two and a half hour trial-by-boredom that precedes entry to Indiana Jones's Temple of the Forbidden Eye. </p> <p> Nothing so graphically illustrates the organizational triumph of Disney as its ability to make people stand in line and like it. But wait. Didn't lines symbolize the bankruptcy of the Soviet system? Maybe Disneyomics has more in common with Soviet rationing than is first apparent. </p> <p> IS Russia poised for economic takeoff? After three years of on-again, off-again reforms and with the Pyrrhic military victory in Chechnya still fresh in the news, skepticism comes easily. But little by little, wary analysts are abandoning their caution. "Russia is a real market economy now," says Andrei Shleifer, an economist at Harvard who has advised the Russian Government on privatization. </p> <p> That doesn't mean the path to affluence is strewn with rose petals. A big test of Moscow's political will to contain inflation looms this summer, when the 30 million Russians who still scratch a living from the soil demand a budget-busting round of subsidies to finance the harvest. The more fundamental challenge -- one the Government will no doubt face for years to come -- is the taming of the private cartels that are replacing public monopolies. "You can't sustain an efficient, continent-wide economy with concentrated economic power," argues Donald W. Green, managing director of Planecon, a Washington-based consulting firm. </p> <p> Moscow News columnist Aleksei Pushkov likes to explain the political and economic changes taking place in Russia today through the life of his neighbor: "He was this poor driver who lived in the apartment off the entryway. Every Friday night he would get drunk and sing along, over and over in a very loud voice, to two English songs: 'Happy Nation' and 'All She Wants Is Another Baby.' He had no idea what the words meant. When he got really drunk, he'd start beating his wife and she would start screaming. He was driving us crazy. I wanted to throw a grenade at him. </p> <p> "Anyway, about eight months ago, I don't know how, he got a share in a small car repair shop," continued Mr. Pushkov. "Since then, no more 'Happy Nation,' no more singing all night, no more beating his wife. He leaves every morning at 8:30 for work and he is satisfied. He knows he has some prospects in life now. My wife said to me the other day, 'Hey, look at Happy Nation' -- that's what we call him -- 'he's an owner now.' I think about this guy and ask myself: 'Next year, will he vote for the Communists? No. Will he Vote for Zhirinovsky? No. He will vote for the center.' " </p> <p> Everyone warned me to beware of street crime in Moscow. So my first morning in the hotel I go down to the front desk and ask for a safety deposit box to store my cash. "I'm sorry," says the desk clerk, "they're all being used. There's a waiting list; would you like me to put you down?" A waiting list for safety deposit boxes? It sounded like the punch line to a joke: "How do you know when you're in a really dangerous city?" </p> <p> After a week here, though, I found reports of Moscow street crime a tad exaggerated. I spent a morning riding around in a police car with the Moscow Municipal Militia, an elite unit for fighting street crime. My hosts sounded like cops dealing with the same problems of any major U.S. city, although they did wear flak jackets and carry submachine guns. They arrested some Ukrainians for improper residence permits, sniffed around for drug peddlers and stolen cars, and complained bitterly that the criminals now drove Mercedeses while their little Russian-made Zhiguly had no reverse gear. </p> <p> The Speaker of Russia's Parliament met with the Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, today and complained that the United States had not provided Russia with millions of dollars in promised economic aid. </p> <p> Ivan P. Rybkin, Speaker of Russia's lower house of Parliament, said he had told Mr. Gingrich that his country had not received all the aid promised to build new housing for Russian troops pulled out of the Baltic states or to decommission more than a dozen Russian nuclear-powered submarines. </p> <p> Russian troops opened an assault early this morning with tanks and heavy machine guns on the hospital in this southern Russian city where some 200 Chechen fighters have been holding up to 2,000 hostages since Wednesday. </p> <p> At 9 A.M. (1 A.M. Eastern time), nearly four hours after the battle began, fighting continued floor to floor in the hospital, according to Russian officials and soldiers near the scene. About 9:15 A.M. there was a lull, and Moscow radio said Chechen fighters had agreed to release woman and children and to continue negotiations, but there was no official reaction from the Russian side. </p> <p> They are from 23 to 26 years old, all of them devotees of capitalism, and all doing just fine in Russia's new free market. </p> <p> They, too, are the "new rich," at least comparatively, and there isn't a criminal among them. Instead, the four Russians -- Dmitri Blekher, a real-estate agent; Yelena Shalneva, a press officer; Sergei Skatershchikov, a financial analyst, and Leonid Bershidsky, a journalist -- are part of an emerging class of young professionals, similar to those in almost any Western country. </p> <p> Underscoring previous warnings from Western experts about the dangers of Soviet-built nuclear power plants, a Federal intelligence report says 10 reactors in Slovakia, Lithuania, Russia, Bulgaria and Ukraine face an abnormally high risk of failure. </p> <p> The danger is attributed to design flaws, tattered economies, political disorder and weak regulatory oversight. </p> <p> In an effort to increase investors' confidence and promote economic stability, Russian officials announced today that the ruble's exchange rate against the dollar would be fixed within a band and not allowed to float freely. </p> <p> The creation of the trading band, which will be in place until Oct. 1, marked the first effort to fix the ruble's rate since the collapse of the Soviet Union, which had used differing exchange rates for different classes of commerce. </p> <p> In the early decades of Soviet Communism, overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Ireland was one of the countries where prayers were said at the end of Sunday Mass for the conversion, or reconversion, of officially atheist Soviet Russia to Christianity. </p> <p> Today, the conversion the Irish are interested in is from rubles into hard currencies like the dollar and the Irish pound. </p> <p> "We live very badly," said Anastasiya Krykova, 71, sitting on the deteriorating stoop of an old-age home for war veterans in the middle of Siberia. "If I didn't still work, I wouldn't have enough to eat." </p> <p> Mrs. Krykova's pension is only 150,000 rubles, or $34 a month, supplemented by $16 more she gets for washing floors in a library in Irkutsk University, one of the cultural treasures of this city founded by the Czar's Cossacks in the 17th century. </p> <p> Two years ago, President Clinton and Congress joined hands to create two investment funds that were to be the primary tools for pumping American money into Russia's ravaged economy and teaching the American way of doing business. </p> <p> But the lessons the two funds have been offering lately are surely not ones the Americans intended: about board room fights, wounded egos, invective and angry resignations. And some people say the ultimate lesson may be that the formula for success on Wall Street does not always work in public and nonprofit operations. </p> <p> After a painful and chaotic slide, the Russian economy appears to be stabilizing, and may be on the brink of growing for the first time since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. </p> <p> There is still considerable risk that things could go awry again, and the gains that look so impressive on statistical charts have been slow to filter down to ordinary Russians. But nearly all the signs are positive. </p> <p> Envoys to NATO approved a blueprint tonight that outlines membership requirements for formerly Communist European countries that want to join the alliance, overriding Russia's continuing strong objections to the very idea of NATO expansion. </p> <p> NATO did not make its paper public today, but officials said it would be presented next Thursday in Brussels and in the following weeks in more detail in other capitals. </p> <p> Growing up on Long Island, the grandson of Russian immigrants, Boris Jordan was fascinated by his family's native land and dreamed of returning to it, perhaps as an American diplomat. He never imagined becoming one of Russia's most powerful financiers and one of the most influential players in its economic transformation. </p> <p> Sent to Moscow three and a half years ago by the CS First Boston Corporation, Mr. Jordan and a small group of colleagues built the securities firm into the dominant investment bank in Russia and played a big role in the development of the country's financial markets. </p> <p> The Moskovsky Gorodskoi Bank does not have a cash machine. It does not have a customer service desk or loan officers. It does not have deposit insurance. And at the moment it does not have the $500 that Vladimir A. Shcherbakov entrusted to it. </p> <p> As he stood outside the bank's main branch, a dilapidated storefront, Mr. Shcherbakov, who needed his money to buy a car, was confronted first by a sign saying no withdrawals could be made for 10 days. Then he was confronted by two men with shiny suits blocking the door, telling him politely but firmly to go away. </p> <p> Scorched by a summer-long drought and plagued by years of bad farm management, Russia's fall grain harvest will be its worst in 30 years, senior Government officials said today. </p> <p> Scorched by a summer-long drought and plagued by years of bad farm management, Russia's fall grain harvest will be its worst in 30 years, senior Government officials said today. </p> <p> "Russia has suffered seriously this year, but we will remain self-sufficient in grain until the 1996 harvest," Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr K. Zaveryukha told the Interfax News Agency upon returning from Canada this afternoon. "We will provide for our own citizens." </p> <p> In a surprise decision that throws the future leadership of Russia in doubt at a time when stability seemed likely, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin announced today that "I have never planned and I am not planning" to run for president next year. </p> <p> The statement leaves an ailing and profoundly unpopular President Boris N. Yeltsin with no obvious political heir, and it raises questions about the course of the market-oriented economic changes that Mr. Chernomyrdin has shepherded over the last two years. </p> <p> In a surprise decision that throws the future leadership of Russia in doubt at a time when stability seemed likely, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin announced today that "I have never planned and I am not planning" to run for president next year. </p> <p> The statement leaves an ailing and profoundly unpopular President Boris N. Yeltsin with no obvious political heir, and it raises questions about the course of the market-oriented economic changes that Mr. Chernomyrdin has shepherded over the last two years. </p> <p> As a man trained in philosophy, Gennadi A. Zyuganov loves to toss around the  big words of the 20th century. He is forever talking about the social democrats  of Britain and the egalitarianism of Sweden. And about how liberalism changes when it travels from Germany to Italy to Spain. </p> <p> But there is one big word you almost never hear the balding, reflective Mr. Zyuganov say out loud: Communism. For some people, particularly in Russia these  days, that would be completely understandable. For the active, voluble and extremely popular chairman of what is still called the Communist Party, it seems a little bit strange. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia dismissed the head of the central bank,  Tatyana Paramonova, yesterday and named her first deputy, Aleksandr Khandruyev,  acting chairman. The move was widely expected after the Parliament's lower house failed for a second time last summer to confirm Ms. Paramonova's nomination. She took over the post in October 1994 after Viktor Gerashchenko was ousted in the wake of a major collapse of the ruble. </p> <p> Ms. Paramonova has been credited with holding to tight monetary policies, which have helped bring down inflation and stabilize the ruble. But she has been criticized by commercial banks and politicians for tightening reserve requirements, mishandling August's liquidity crisis and a growing tide of bank insolvencies. Mr. Khandruyev is regarded as an ally of Mr. Gerashchenko and is seen as less committed to tight money than Ms. Paramonova. </p> <p> (AP) </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin dismissed the acting chief of the Central Bank today in a move aimed at appeasing Parliament, but which raised questions about  the Russian Government's commitment to lowering inflation. </p> <p> The banker, Tatyana Paramonova, had been credited with tight monetary policies that have helped reduce Russian inflation and stabilize the ruble for the first time since 1992. She was temporarily replaced by her first deputy, Aleksandr Khandruyev, who is seen by some as less committed to her policies. </p> <p> In a move expected to end Russia's financial isolation and enable it to borrow on world capital markets, Russian officials signed an agreement today with a group of 600 creditor banks to reschedule the payment of interest and principal on $32.5 billion in loans. </p> <p> Deputy Prime Minister Oleg D. Davydov said the agreement would also pave the  way for a similar rescheduling of $40 billion of loans it owes to Western governments. </p> <p> The Communists may be on the march again. Economic reforms have faltered. But George Soros has not given up on Russia. </p> <p> The billionaire financier and self-appointed promoter of capitalism and democracy in former Communist countries is selectively investing in Russia despite all the risks and the ominous headlines. </p> <p> Here is Gennady Punditsky with my insider's forecast of Sunday's Russian election, including how to instantly analyze results, also what it will all mean. </p> <p> "The Commies are coming!" is what your American headlines are screaming. Polls say Communist Party will win 25 percent of party vote for seats in the Duma. This noisy Parliament is our version of U.N. General Assembly -- all talk, with real power remaining in Kremlin -- but its election is like snow blowing in wind about presidential election next June. </p> <p> In June 1992, Nina Zvereva was approached in a Moscow courtyard as she washed a battered brown Zhiguli, a Soviet-made Fiat. </p> <p> Then 28, she was just learning to drive, and she and her younger sister, Natasha, their husbands and their parents were struggling to find a niche in the new economy six months after the Soviet Union collapsed, prices were freed from Government controls and inflation gathered a frightening momentum. </p> <p> The leader of Russia's Communist Party should be having a ball right now. When voters elect a new Parliament on Sunday there is little doubt that his slate will win more votes than any other. </p> <p> But the Communist leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, has suddenly begun to discover that resurrection has its price. For months he has sold himself and his party as being more like Western European Social Democrats than the gruesome Stalinists Russia thought it put to the stake four years ago. </p> <p> All fall, it was an election campaign propelled by fear, mistrust and anger.  But when the day of reckoning finally came, Russian voters seemed almost cheerful. </p> <p> They turned out in high numbers despite freezing weather and a raging flu epidemic -- some wore gauze masks as they voted. And many seemed pleased with the process, if not always the politicians. </p> <p> In the most vivid display yet of his disenchantment with economic reform, President Boris N. Yeltsin chose a Soviet-schooled industrialist today to serve  as Russia's top economic official. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin announced that Vladimir V. Kadannikov, the director of Russia's largest and ailing automobile company and an advocate of protective tariffs, would replace Anatoly B. Chubais, the free-market crusader, as Deputy Prime Minister. </p> <p> As top specialists from the International Monetary Fund complete a painstaking review of Russia's eligibility for critical foreign loans, President Boris N. Yeltsin has embarked on a pre-election promising spree that economists  say casts new doubt on his commitment to economic discipline. </p> <p> Experts whose assessment may determine Russia's access to $9 billion in new Western lending are worried that Mr. Yeltsin's budget-busting promises -- if he  keeps them -- could undermine the country's market reforms by igniting inflation, according to economists familiar with the deliberations. </p> <p> President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, after meetings today with Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia, expressed their confidence in Russia's continuing commitment to market reform despite Moscow's dismissal of well-known reformers and new plans for large social expenditures. </p> <p> Since the Russian Communist Party did so well in December elections for the lower house of Parliament, President Boris N. Yeltsin, expected to seek re-election in June, has been moving to co-opt the Communist policy agenda and ridding his Government of ministers associated with Western-style reform. </p> <p> In a vast ballroom of the Noga Hilton in Geneva in October, directors of Russia's largest private bank, Oneksim Bank, celebrated the opening of their Swiss affiliate over caviar and chilled Russian vodka. </p> <p> Oneksim Bank, which was founded in 1993, is the only Russian commercial bank  to have met the starchy conditions of the Swiss Central Bank, a feat so challenging that a financial reporter in Moscow likened it to "me flying to the  moon." Almost as if feting a lunar landing, Russia's Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, sent the bankers an effusive congratulatory telegram. </p> <p> Distancing himself from the economic reforms that are the hallmark of his presidency, President Boris N. Yeltsin today accepted the resignation of Anatoly B. Chubais, a pillar of economic reform and the last liberal in his increasingly hard-line Cabinet. </p> <p> Mr. Chubais, 40, the Deputy Prime Minister who supervised the stabilization of the Russian economy and planned its privatization program, said he was leaving because Mr. Yeltsin had criticized his work. At a news conference tonight, Mr. Chubais, a beacon of free-market reform to the West, warned that any change of economic course before the presidential elections in June would be a "monstrous mistake." </p> <p> George Soros, the financier, announced plans today to finance a new project for developing the Internet in Russia, and also said he would begin investing selectively here again after pulling out of most of his holdings in 1994. </p> <p> Despite his renewed interest in Russia, Mr. Soros also warned at a news conference that he considered Russia's investment situation "extremely precarious" ahead of presidential elections in June. </p> <p> Senior Administration officials, once invariably chipper about President Boris N. Yeltsin, are taking a markedly more shaded and wary tone about him these days. </p> <p> After the strong Communist showing in Russia's parliamentary elections last month and Mr. Yeltsin's second episode of heart disease, American officials are  expressing considerable concern about the presidential election scheduled for June and the chance that pro-reform candidates will fail to unite behind a single candidate. </p> <p> Securing a respite from election-year labor unrest, the Russian Government tapped its severely strained budget today to persuade striking miners to go back to work. </p> <p> After rushing money to the miners and assuring them that a hefty $2.2 billion would be allocated to the coal industry this year, Russian officials persuaded the Russian Coal Workers Union to end a two-day strike by about half a million miners. </p> <p> A couple of jokes being told by Russian delegates at last week's Davos economic forum bear repeating. One was: What is the difference between an optimist and a pessimist in Russia today? Answer: A pessimist believes that things in Russia can't possibly get any worse. An optimist believes that they can. </p> <p> Count me an optimist about Russia. </p> <p> Defying the President they helped bring to power five years ago, nearly half  a million Russian coal miners went on strike today to demand $200 million in unpaid wages. </p> <p> So did one million coal miners in Ukraine, who say they are owed $367 million in back pay. </p> <p> Casting himself as Russia's best hope for protecting democracy and market reforms from a lurch back to the past, President Boris N. Yeltsin announced today that he would seek a second term in the presidential election in June. </p> <p> His declaration amounted to the formal opening of a campaign that, according  to every measure of public opinion, could well bring back to power the Communists Mr. Yeltsin ousted five years ago. </p> <p> Sounding eerily like the Communists he is battling for control of Russia, President Boris N. Yeltsin delivered a somber annual address today that was devoted almost completely to blaming his own Government for the tide of problems that have afflicted the nation since he became its leader. </p> <p> Speaking before a Parliament that has come to be dominated by his Communist and nationalist opponents, the 65-year-old Mr. Yeltsin did not smile once during an hourlong speech in which he seemed more interested in appealing to those disaffected with his presidency than in explaining why the difficult course of reform is the right one for Russia. </p> <p> Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia said today that he would soften the process of economic reform as demanded by President Boris N. Yeltsin. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin, in Friday's state of the nation address, criticized his own Government for failing to protect living standards while steering the country to a market economy, and he said the Government could be kicked out of office as a result. </p> <p> Last month Gennadi A. Zyuganov, presidential candidate and leader of the Communist Party, was the urbane, jolly statesman who impressed a worldly gathering in Switzerland with his talk of pluralism and business know-how. </p> <p> But this week Russians are seeing a different Mr. Zyuganov, belligerent and defensive. Even as he paints himself as a coalition candidate bound to defend the interests of non-Communist voters, his campaign is mired in accusations that his party harbors a "secret plan" to restore repressive Soviet-style rule and centralized economic management. </p> <p> Revising Soviet history as he goes, the Communist leader Gennadi A. Zyuganov  made his first presidential campaign swing today, trying out his election pledge to preserve pluralism and private property on mostly Communist crowds in the distant provinces. </p> <p> Mr. Zyuganov has been accused of talking like a social democrat to non-Communist audiences and like a hard-line Communist to the party rank and file. Out here on the stump in southern Siberia, he is crafting a message that justifies modest economic liberalism by rooting it in the Soviet past, mixing in familiar slogans and references to Lenin and Stalin meant to reassure the old guard. </p> <p> The International Monetary Fund said today that it had approved a $10.2 billion loan for Russia. The move is expected to be helpful to President Boris N. Yeltsin in the presidential election in June. </p> <p> The three-year loan is the fund's second biggest, after a $17.8 billion credit granted to Mexico last year. It is designed to help Russia along the road from Communism to capitalism. </p> <p> Carefully sidestepping his party's most divisive positions, Russia's Communist presidential candidate, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, unveiled an election program today that is fashioned to appeal to a broad coalition of voters. </p> <p> Though his nine-point program -- a vague, airbrushed version of his party's platform -- is fiercely populist and anti-free market, Mr. Zyuganov avoided using such hot-button terms as "nationalization," "Communism" or even "Soviet Union." </p> <p> The leaders of Russia and Belarus agreed today to form a "union state" which, while it would not quite merge the Governments of the two Slavic nations, would  nevertheless tie them to each other economically, politically and culturally. </p> <p> Such a plan has long been discussed, particularly in Belarus, where it has been eagerly sought.  But the speed and timing of the decision clearly grows mostly from election-year politics in Russia, where the Communist-dominated lower house of Parliament voted last week to denounce the 1991 accord that led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. </p> <p> In an effort to tap popular nostalgia for the former Soviet Union, President  Boris N. Yeltsin signed an agreement today to forge closer ties with Kazakstan,  Kyrgyzstan and Belarus. </p> <p> The agreement on economic integration, which was signed with the leaders of three former Soviet republics, is part of Mr. Yeltsin's political strategy to draw support away from the Communists, who have urged that the Soviet Union be restored. </p> <p> When Dmitri V. Vasiliev was a student of Marxist economics, he was taught that the stock market was a casino for the super-rich. </p> <p> "They stressed it served a narrow circle and was not in the interests of the  broad masses of people," Mr. Vasiliev recalled with a smile. </p> <p> The last time a Russian leader came to this city, in May 1989, the streets were clogged with student protesters demanding democracy and China seemed to be  on the brink of cataclysmic political change. </p> <p> The leader, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, was hailed by students camped outside City Hall as the kind of forward-looking man that China  needed to abandon its outdated ideology and rescue dilapidated cities like Shanghai. </p> <p> A day before his one-on-one meeting with Boris N. Yeltsin, President Clinton  today urged Russia to stay on the path of democratic and economic reform. But he declined to state his preference in the Russian presidential election, which could return a resurgent Communist Party to power. </p> <p> Pressed about the June Russian presidential election at a news conference after the close of a meeting on nuclear security, Mr. Clinton praised Mr. Yeltsin as a leader who had helped to reduce the nuclear threat remaining from the cold war. But he quickly added, "It is not right for the United States or for any other country to tell people how they should vote." </p> <p> Russia got up to seven years' more breathing space today on repaying more than $40 billion of the accumulated debt it owes to foreign governments, possibly giving another lift to President Boris N. Yeltsin's prospects for re-election this summer. </p> <p> Russian negotiators went into talks with 18 creditor nations here on Thursday asking for a rescheduling plan that would give them up to 25 years to pay off the credits, seven more years than the creditors' group has ever given before. </p> <p> If Boris N. Yeltsin is re-elected President of Russia in June, he will owe his victory in some part to one of Washington's least-known but most powerful people: Michel Camdessus. </p> <p> The 63-year-old Frenchman is head of the International Monetary Fund, the obscure global lending organization that gave a vital lift to Mr. Yeltsin's campaign when it formally approved a $10.2 billion loan to Russia last Tuesday. </p> <p> In a stark expression of what they hope to achieve if they take back power, Communist members of Parliament have prepared a draft law that calls for heavy state intervention in the economy. </p> <p> The proposed law would curtail pro-market reforms and rejects some key measures Russia has adopted at the insistence of the International Monetary Fund, which recently granted Russia a $10.1 billion loan. </p> <p> At the age of 22, Galina Mardoyan has seen enough turmoil to last a lifetime. By the time she was done with high school, the Soviet Union had collapsed. As an Armenian living in Georgia, she felt despised, so she moved to a resort on the Black Sea, where she hoped to live quietly with her grandmother. </p> <p> She got there in 1992, just in time to watch thousands of her new neighbors in the once glorious vacation town of Sukhumi butcher one another in a savage civil war. She fled again, this time to Moscow, where she is a college student. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin said today that he had offered to put Grigory A. Yavlinsky, an economist who is Mr. Yeltsin's main liberal challenger, in charge  of Russia's market reforms if he would agree to drop out of the presidential race. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin said that he had proposed the post of Deputy Prime Minister to Mr. Yavlinsky but that Mr. Yavlinsky had wanted more. </p> <p> The re-election of Boris N. Yeltsin promises to be a hard sell in this downtrodden factory town 200 miles northeast of Moscow. </p> <p> The two textile plants in Lezhnevo are idle. The recent voting trend here in the Ivanovo region is strongly anti-Yeltsin. Workers and retirees, dispirited and cynical, are more preoccupied with getting by than with politics. </p> <p> Yuri D. Maslyukov took another puff from his cigarette and smiled about his recent meeting with a senior official from the International Monetary Fund. </p> <p> "It was like people from the Hawaiian Islands trying to talk to Eskimos," chuckled Mr. Maslyukov, who is a top adviser to the Communist candidate for President of Russia, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, and is also the chairman of Parliament's Committee for Economic Policy. </p> <p> TWO weeks before Russia's second presidential election, market analysts are betting that the incumbent, Boris N. Yeltsin, will emerge as the winner and complete the nation's transition to market capitalism, sending stock values soaring. </p> <p> But even if the prize goes to his principal rival, Gennadi A. Zyuganov -- who calls himself a Communist, has criticized President Yeltsin's tough anti-inflation measures, and hinted that he may renationalize some companies --  many of these same analysts feel that in practice he will unable to do much more than temporarily slow the pace of economic change. And that, too, leaves their outlook for the market positive. </p> <p> It has been four decades since they carved this gentle haven for scientists from the deep stands of birch and poplar that sweep across the Siberian plain. It was to be a city like no other in the workers' paradise, a place where the unhindered ideals of socialism would fuel the quest for perfect truth. </p> <p> For a while it seemed to work. Nikita S. Khrushchev, who created this science city, spared nothing to make certain that the finest Soviet minds were freed from the worries of the common man. If a researcher needed to fly 3,000 miles to Moscow, he had only to ask for a ticket. Expensive new equipment arrived on every train. As institutes sprouted among the blooming lilacs, thousands of idealistic men and women rushed to fill them. </p> <p> Polina S. Novozhilova, a sinewy cement plant operator, remembers the glory days of working in this seaport: a 30 percent bonus for working in the Soviet Far East and guaranteed grocery supplies to ease life in a "closed city." </p> <p> Today, Russia's Far East is wide open, and Mrs. Novozhilova has a second job, peddling imported Coca-Colas from her new workplace, a sidewalk stand. </p> <p> Having endured crime, a chaotic financial system and an economy that promises better days but has yet to deliver, American and other foreign companies that do business in Russia do not rattle easily. </p> <p> But despite public displays of bravado and a small flurry of new deals in the last few months, big corporations and other international investors have clearly been shaken by the possibility of a Communist victory in Russia's upcoming Presidential elections. </p> <p> Struggling to limit the economic damage from President Boris N. Yeltsin's increasingly costly campaign promises, Russia's Central Bank imposed a series of measures today to tighten credit and keep inflation down. </p> <p> The moves came after Mr. Yeltsin instructed the Central Bank to transfer $1 billion to the federal budget so he could fulfill campaign promises to teachers, doctors and the military. </p> <p> Profoundly disenchanted by five years of faltering economic reforms but equally disturbed by the prospect of a new Communism that could drag this country back into the darkness of the Soviet era, millions of Russian voters will make the starkest political choice of their lives on Sunday. </p> <p> The differences between the main candidates seem strikingly clear: Boris N. Yeltsin, the first man elected President in Russia, promises that if he wins again his reforms will continue, openness will spread and Russia will take its place among the world's leading industrial nations. </p> <p> Saying today that he felt the "pain" of the Russian people, President Boris N. Yeltsin made a strong but emotional appeal for the voters' support. </p> <p> "I feel all your pain, all the country's pain," Mr. Yeltsin said, echoing a Clintonism, in the 127-page account of his political platform he made public today. "However, I am sure it is the pain of a recovering organism." </p> <p> Citing the Yeltsin Government's problems with tax collection, the International Monetary Fund said today that it would delay its $330 million payment to Russia this month for the first time. </p> <p> When Russia was granted a $10.2 billion three-year loan in February, the Fund set particularly stringent conditions, including monthly reviews of Russia's economic status. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin today heightened alarm about his health and gave new impetus to a power struggle in the Kremlin when he abruptly left Moscow for  a sanitarium. </p> <p> His sudden departure for what an aide described as a two-week vacation stunned an American delegation headed by Vice President Al Gore, whose meeting with Mr. Yeltsin was canceled at the last minute. The Americans had hoped to use the meeting to underscore support for the Russian President and assess his physical stamina following a grueling re-election campaign. </p> <p> Vice President Al Gore, opening a three-day visit to Russia, met here today with Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin to discuss economic reforms and the expansion of NATO. </p> <p> Mr. Gore will meet on Monday with Boris N. Yeltsin, the Russian President's first meeting with a foreign leader since his victory in the runoff election on  July 3. </p> <p> Amid the palpable relief in the Clinton Administration over Boris N. Yeltsin's victory in today's Russian election is some quiet wagering, officials  say, over how quickly Mr. Yeltsin will have the bypass operation on his heart he so clearly seems to need. </p> <p> The last few days of tension over Mr. Yeltsin's health were exacerbated by the Americans' lack of access to the Russian President, though the Russians insisted that Mr. Yeltsin's condition was not life-threatening. There is a similar concern, the officials say, over Mr. Yeltsin's plans for a second term,  though "we look to quickly engage with Yeltsin and his team over economic and security issues," a senior Administration official said today. </p> <p> While traveling, you are often asked what you do for a living. Lately I answer that I'm a foreign affairs columnist and that means I cover wars -- occasionally wars between countries but more often the wars between economic winners and losers within countries. Because it is these domestic wars that increasingly shape international affairs, from Russia to Mexico to Turkey. </p> <p> Why have such internal wars become so sharp? The short answer is "globalization" -- the integration of free markets, financial flows, trade and information -- which has established a very powerful set of rules and standards  for how countries have to behave if they are going to attract investment capital to grow. You can call those rules "The Paradigm." Once a country opens itself up to the global market and accepts The Paradigm, those of its citizens with the skills to take advantage of it become the winners and those without become losers or left-behinds. </p> <p> Ever since Russia and China embarked on their separate paths of reform there's been a competition between the two over who got it right. In this race,  China was always viewed as the hare, which rushed ahead with economic reform, leaving political reform for later. Russia was always viewed as the tortoise, which, stupidly in the minds of the Chinese, tried to do political and economic  reform at once. Well, don't count the tortoise out yet. </p> <p> Yes, China has a huge economic lead on Russia, but keep this in mind: With the democratic election of Boris Yeltsin as President last week, Russia has basically passed over a huge speed bump on the road to its development; it has made the political transition to a rudimentary form of democracy, and has done so rather smoothly. China, while it is growing rapidly, still has this huge speed bump waiting for it down the road: How will it make the transition from Communist dictatorship to a more democratic system? Because as China grows more  prosperous, its people will inevitably demand a more participatory government, and to reach the next stage of economic development Chinese businesses will require a less arbitrary system, with real rule of law. No one, least of all investors in China, knows what will happen to China when it hits that speed bump. So in the race between the tortoise and the hare, score last week a Great  Leap Forward for the tortoise. </p> <p> Russian voters will make a distinct and fateful choice in Wednesday's presidential election, but the economic and social problems that will surface after they cast their ballots will bedevil the Government no matter who wins. </p> <p> Even if President Boris N. Yeltsin wins re-election, his Government will have little time for rejoicing. Tax revenues are dangerously low, while Government spending throughout the campaign was feverish and unaccounted for. </p> <p> Vice President Al Gore will urge President Boris N. Yeltsin to capitalize on  the mandate for reform that he won with his re-election when the two men meet in Moscow, probably on Monday, American officials said this week. Mr. Gore is to arrive in Moscow tonight. </p> <p> He and about half the United States Cabinet will be in Moscow on Monday and Tuesday for the seventh in a series of semi-annual meetings with their Russian counterparts, led by Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who has been renominated to his post by Mr. Yeltsin. </p> <p> One day this spring, Canadian Navy sailors climbed a hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean and put marble headstones over graves of American and Canadian soldiers who died here while fighting against the Bolsheviks in 1918. Down the hill, workmen are restoring the Beaux Arts terminal of the Trans-Siberian Railway. Nearby, work is to start on another turn-of-the-century tourist attraction -- a mansion that the Communists expropriated from the family of Yul Brynner, the actor. </p> <p> As if awakening from a decades-old deep sleep, this Pacific port is slowly reassuming the character that once made it one of Russia's most cosmopolitan cities. A free port in Czarist days, Vladivostok virtually dropped off Westerners' maps after the Communists took control here in 1922. </p> <p> Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin announced a new Cabinet today that looked remarkably like the old one -- with one striking exception. </p> <p> Vladimir O. Potanin, 35, president of Oneximbank, one of Russia's richest and most powerful private banks, was put in charge of coordinating economic policy, including the sensitive issue of privatization. </p> <p> There are more than 15,000 Avon ladies in Russia, and not one of them rings the doorbell. </p> <p> Bowing both to security fears and old-time Soviet etiquette, Russian representatives of the world's largest direct-sales cosmetics company do not go door to door. They do not even make house calls to established customers. Instead, they sell lipsticks, wrinkle creams and facial toners in factories, airports, beauty parlors, laboratories and, sometimes, from a park bench. </p> <p> Peace between Russia and its mutinous republic of Chechnya seemed closer than ever today. But peace between President Boris N. Yeltsin and his chief security adviser, Aleksandr I. Lebed, did not. </p> <p> Late on Friday, Mr. Yeltsin halfheartedly endorsed Mr. Lebed's plan for ending the war in Chechnya and congratulated him on the ''first steps'' he had made. Flying here from Moscow today for more talks with the rebel leaders, Mr. Lebed angrily produced a decree signed by Mr. Yeltsin on Aug. 18 but made public just today. He said it would be ''almost impossible'' to stop the war if the decree was enforced. </p> <p> The hottest store in Moscow now is suitably named Arrears. </p> <p> Every morning, hours before its doors open, bargain hunters begin lining up for a chance to inspect the latest booty seized by the Moscow tax police: boxes of down coats going for the equivalent of $17, a crate of $2 red corduroy men's pants, piles of $3 denim backpacks and a 10-year-old Hungarian-made bus, going for $19,000. </p> <p> Few Russian companies are able to entice Westerners to line up to buy their shares, given the unstable political and economic situation in the country. But investors raced to buy the initial public offering of Gazprom, Russia's huge natural gas company, today and paid a premium for the shares when trading opened in London. </p> <p> Their eagerness illustrated a contemporary Russian political reality: When Gazprom talks, officials listen. Indeed, the company's chairman, responding to a planned Government crackdown on tax delinquents, put it bluntly -- what is good for Gazprom is good for Russia. </p> <p> The Russian general, standing ramrod stiff in a business suit, waved aside another plate of American food. ''Bread, salt and onions,'' he requested. </p> <p> After a round of interviews with and speeches at many of America's opinion leaders, Gen. Aleksandr Lebed -- peacemaker of Chechnya, surprise political challenger to Yeltsin, recently bounced out of the Yeltsin Kremlin after pushing for too much power -- was relaxing at a reception given in the Bethesda home of businessman Fred Bush. </p> <p> A piece of the new Russia goes on sale today on the New York Stock Exchange. Russia's leading cellular telephone company, Vimpel-Communications A.O., is set for a roughly $90 million initial public offering as the first Russian company to be listed on the Big Board. When trading begins, investors will be able to buy part of a young company run by former Soviet military scientists who, according to the prospectus, have been making money hand over cellular handset. </p> <p> Vimpelcom, as the company is known, is also a case study of leveraging political connections into cash in the Wild West business atmosphere of today's Russia. </p> <p> George Soros, the Hungarian-born investor who amassed a fortune through currency speculation, has guaranteed $1 million to help create a new home for a fledgling American-style business school at the University of St. Petersburg in Russia. </p> <p> Through his network of foundations, Mr. Soros has for years donated money for projects throughout Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union to assist institutions that foster democracy. The new pledge, from one of those foundations, the Open Society Institute, is for $750,000 in a direct grant and the guarantee of an additional $250,000 grant that is expected to be issued by the United States Information Agency. </p> <p> High above the idle smokestacks of this ailing industrial city looms a huge, haunting memorial to the million Russians who died in World War II defending the city, known then as Stalingrad. But their sacrifice is also kept alive in humbler ways. </p> <p> Grocery stores have small signs reminding shoppers to be ''attentive and kind'' to survivors of the siege -- ''a small price to pay for what they did for us.'' People too young to have lived through it describe it as if it happened yesterday. Volgograd schoolchildren paint pictures of the siege in art class. </p> <p> DREAMS of cheap and unlimited electric power from the fusion of hydrogen atoms were jolted last week with the disclosure of calculations casting doubt on the performance of a projected $10 billion international reactor. </p> <p> The journal Science reported on Friday that a team of American fusion experts had calculated that the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, or I.T.E.R., would not produce appreciable power if built according to present plans. </p> <p> A 12-foot Christmas tree stands in front of Russia's most famous toy store glimmering with unsubliminal advertising. It is trimmed with huge fake boxes of Nesquik, the Nestle chocolate powder. </p> <p> The new spirit of Russian Christmas can also be found in grocery stores, where Petrovich, a Russian beverage company, is marketing a Christmas holiday champagne for children. It is non-alcoholic and sold in champagne bottles bearing the images of Disney's Pocahontas and Lion King, for $6 a bottle. </p> <p> In a qualified endorsement of Moscow's economic policies, the International Monetary Fund has decided to resume disbursement of its $10.1 billion loan to Russia. </p> <p> Fund officials had suspended its payments to Russia in October because of the Government's chronic failure to plug tax loopholes and raise revenue. </p> <p> Sometimes the news is in the noise and sometimes the news is in the silence. If you want to understand what's wrong with NATO expansion -- the new Clinton Administration's first major foreign-policy challenge -- then you should listen to the silence, the silence of Europeans on this subject. Don't get me wrong, the West Europeans support NATO expansion, but it's nothing they ever seem to talk much about or debate. They treat it as something America will take care of, something America will finesse with the Russians and something America will pay for. </p> <p> And that's the news. The West European states are the ones supposedly most threatened by a resurgent Russia, which is right next door. They are the ones supposedly most in need of the East Europeans' joining NATO to create a buffer with Russia. And yet the members of the European Union seem about as interested in NATO expansion as they are in the Super Bowl. Why? Because the West Europeans think the real threat to them is not Russia, but Eastern Europe. </p> <p> During his swing through the corridors of America's business world this week, Aleksandr I. Lebed, the retired general who aspires to be the next President of Russia, hobnobbed with executives at Du Pont in Delaware and sipped tea with Wall Street investors at the Harvard Club in Manhattan. </p> <p> And then he dropped in on the man who aspires to be the king of New York capitalism. </p> <p> After a year of bitter politics and Kremlin intrigue, Russia now faces one of its toughest economic tests. </p> <p> Besieged by striking workers, a disgruntled military and a distressingly large number of tax delinquents, the Russian Government has been running hard just to stay in place. The key question for 1997, however, is whether the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin has the political will to expand and institutionalize capitalism. </p> <p> The Georgians were the last to know. Without even a hint of consultation with this country's authorities, the Russian border guards who still patrol Georgia's frontiers seized the Almaz, a Ukrainian ship, recently and took it to the Georgian port of Batumi. </p> <p> After being spirited to Russia and charged with smuggling during a previous port call in Russia, the Ukrainian sailors were released. </p> <p> Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov are scheduled to meet in Moscow on Thursday to discuss ways to strengthen ties between NATO and Russia -- despite Russian objections to the alliance's decision to bring in new members. The chances of progress will be greater if the Russians understand not just the inevitability of enlargement, but the reasons for it. </p> <p> The decision to expand the alliance began with a question. After the breakup of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, should there remain, on the landscape of Europe, a military alliance or should NATO retire voluntarily to the ash heap of history? </p> <p> In Nadezhda Shilyayeva's first-grade class, the words of the day are ''profit'' and ''inventory.'' As the kindly teacher bounces her pointer along the curly blackboard script, her 26 students at School 139 sing the syllables in unison. </p> <p> ''Now what do we call the money left over in Misha's wallet after all his expenses are paid?'' asked Miss Shilyayeva. ''Profit!'' shouted a pigtailed 7-year-old girl named Dasha. The teacher continued, ''And why does Misha need this profit?'' </p> <p> The managers of Russia's largest carmaker like to think big. </p> <p> Two thousand cars a day roll off the clattering, mile-long assembly lines here at the Avtovaz plant. Its gleaming new headquarters is 24 stories high. An entire city was built along the Volga River to accommodate the 111,000 workers who toil away at the main plant. </p> <p> In the last 10 years, Boris Kanishev has endured all the broken promises and flat-out lies a man can handle. A union leader in this city best known as the center of Russian airplane design, he has watched in dismay as the enormous industry has withered to nothing. </p> <p> Mr. Kanishev considers himself a reform-minded politician. He voted for Boris Yeltsin in last year's presidential election because, he said today, ''Communism is a thing of the past.'' </p> <p> Ask most Russians about this grimy old center for gunsmiths and ironmongers and you can expect a long, blank stare. Few know it was once a mighty seat of war: the thunderous cannon that drove Napoleon from Russia were made here, and in time the city's factories graduated to the Kalashnikov rifle and the ballistic missile. </p> <p> For decades the region around Izhevsk, known as Udmurtiya -- closed, snowbound and forgotten -- was simply another Soviet secret that nobody wanted to know. Not anymore, though. </p> <p> After months of illness and seclusion, a visibly reinvigorated President Boris N. Yeltsin, 66, promised today to clean house in his administration and speed up free-market reform. </p> <p> The cornerstone, he said, would be new faces in power. </p> <p> The joke on the phone from Moscow has two guys in the front seat of a speeding car. One shouts ''Turn the wheel! We're going to crash!'' and the other says ''I can't.'' ''But there's a stone wall ahead -- turn now!'' ''Can't.'' ''Why not?'' ''Because you have the wheel.'' </p> <p> Boris Yeltsin has the wheel and is shouting at others to turn Russia's economy from disaster. He's six months late and $10 billion short in payments of wages to teachers, the police and the military. Unions plan an all-Russia general strike at the end of the month. </p> <p> In the elegant Estee Lauder Beauty Center on the sumptuous grounds of the Moscow Country Club, wealthy women fill empty lives with facials, massage and the kindness of beauticians. </p> <p> ''To be honest, I am very lonely,'' Elvira Averyanova, 41, confided in a soft whisper. ''I am someone who needs human contact. I try to go to places where I am known, and I am greeted warmly.'' </p> <p> Rapidly delivering on his promise to throw some human dynamite into the faltering Russian Government, President Boris N. Yeltsin named his most effective yet despised aide tonight to a position that will essentially give him control of the economy. </p> <p> The appointment of the aide, Anatoly B. Chubais, as First Deputy Prime Minister had been expected and it was eagerly anticipated by Western investors who see the President's canny 41-year-old chief of staff as the only man capable of keeping the nation on the troublesome road to economic reform. </p> <p> But the news, which was released late tonight at the beginning of a long holiday weekend, was met with far more skepticism here than in Washington or in Paris. Mr. Chubais is the most hated public figure in Russia, having led the initial, disastrous and much-detested effort to introduce privatization here. </p> <p> If you have any doubts that the cold war is over, I suggest you watch CNN's coverage of Albania. </p> <p> The CNN reports usually begin by showing a map of the sea off Albania. On this map are little ships, each representing one of the U.S. and other foreign naval vessels that have rushed to Albania's shores. In the cold war, the ships on that map would have been U.S. and Soviet warships competing over who would get into Albania first, fill the vacuum there and thus gain an edge in the worldwide superpower competition. In the new era, an era defined not by the cold war but by globalization, the game is different: The winner is the country whose navy gets its citizens out of Albania first and gets away the fastest. Today, the loser occupies Albania; the winner evacuates Albania. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin filled the senior ranks of the Russian Cabinet with economic reformers today, making good on his pledge to overhaul his Government and quicken the pace of economic change. </p> <p> The shake-up, which gave Russia its most aggressively market-oriented Government since 1992, is aimed primarily at reviving a stalled economic program that has created fertile ground for Mr. Yeltsin's political opponents. </p> <p> Under intense political fire at home, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel sought a reprieve in Moscow today, focusing on improving economic ties to Russia and courting Russia's newly assertive Jewish minority. </p> <p> Mr. Netanyahu, on his first official visit to Russia, held two packed meetings with Jewish leaders, one in a Moscow synagogue, another in the Kolonny Zal, the vast, august government building where Stalin and other Communist leaders once lay in state. </p> <p> In more than five years as Governor, Boris Nemtsov has labored mightily to make this Volga River region a bastion of free-market reform. </p> <p> He and his youthful aides courted Western investors. They tried to nurture small businesses. They transformed the cityscape, which now boasts a trade fair and a pedestrian shopping mall. </p> <p> At a recent rally near Red Square to protest the Russian Government's delays in paying salaries and pensions, people's rage quickly focused on a different culprit. </p> <p> ''Why are there no Russians in government?'' Zinaida Piskunova screeched. ''Why, why, why are there only Jews?'' She is 46, a rosy-cheeked collective farm worker from the city of Yaroslavl who wore a flowered kerchief and a sandwich board that read, ''Down With the Government, Zionist Know-It-Alls!'' </p> <p> When President Boris N. Yeltsin wants to play the nationalist card he simply rolls out the red carpet for the United States' most vexing rivals and bitter adversaries. </p> <p> In recent weeks, Russia has ostentatiously turned toward the East, inviting officials from China, India and Iran. Mr. Yeltsin has posed for the cameras hugging the Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, and Russian officials have boasted of fashioning a ''multipolar world'' in which the United States would no longer be the dominant player. </p> <p> Russia and Belarus agreed today to form a new union, a largely symbolic move intended to appeal to nostalgia for the old Soviet empire. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin signed the accord with the autocratic leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, in a grand Kremlin ceremony. ''Our union is aimed at forging further relations of brotherhood, friendship and all-around cooperation,'' Mr. Yeltsin declared. </p> <p> The architect of Russia's economic reform program, Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly B. Chubais, said today that he would stop working with the Harvard institute that had lent him its brightest economists to assist Russia's rocky transition to a market system. </p> <p> The decision followed the dismissal of two consultants from the prestigious Harvard Institute for International Development. American officials accused the two men of misusing their positions for personal gain.  Mr. Chubais had worked with the two men for years. </p> <p> The United States Agency for International Development has suspended $14 million in grants to an institute at Harvard University, saying two of its advisers on a project promoting fiscal and legal reforms in Russia used their positions for personal profit, officials said today. </p> <p> The agency suspended the grants, the last part of a $57 million contract with the Harvard Institute for International Development, after an investigation uncovered what officials described as evidence that the advisers, Andrei Shleifer and Jonathan Hay, had misused the money. </p> <p> The newly renamed ''summit of the eight'' opened today with President Clinton, buoyed by an effervescent economy, meeting the revived Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, and trying to soothe European anger over what they see as America's arrogance in  NATO and the United Nations. </p> <p> A fit-looking Mr. Yeltsin seemed thrilled just to be here, basking in the attention accorded a nearly full member of this group of the world's most important nations. Russia is taking part in every session except an hour of financial conversation on Saturday, and making Russia feel welcome is the main point, senior American officials said. </p> <p> President Clinton and the leaders of Russia, Japan and Western Europe plunged into the messy business of defining their new roles in the global economy today, with Russia pressing for quick entry into the World Trade Organization and Europe struggling to save its effort to unify under a single currency. </p> <p> Buoyed by the strongest economic performance in the world, Mr. Clinton exuded optimism at the opening of the summit meeting, which until this year was called the Group of Seven, but now, with the inclusion of Russia, is formally called the Summit of the Eight. Nevertheless the President's aides were clearly skeptical that Russia and Europe were prepared to adopt the major economic reforms that American officials believe are necessary in the next year or two. </p> <p> In 1991 in London, Mikhail S. Gorbachev was invited to join the leaders of the Group of Seven only for lunch, after their working sessions. </p> <p> In 1992, Boris N. Yeltsin came to the meeting in Munich as a penitent, getting some aid and two meals, though by most accounts he crashed dinner. </p> <p> The basic view from this mountain village hasn't changed for 7,000 years, since a giant reservoir of molten lava crested over to form the mighty peak of Asia's largest and most active volcano. Eagles and falcons dance through the crisp air. Not far away, the world's biggest population of grizzly bears -- shaking off their winter slumber -- forage for salmon as big as dogs. </p> <p> There is nothing else in Russia, and little left on earth, like Kamchatka. A peninsula the size of California, with just one long, partly paved road, it has more earthquakes and live volcanoes -- including Asia's biggest and most active, Klyuchevskaya Sopka -- than anywhere else. Thanks to its fertile rivers, lakes and seas, the region accounts for nearly half the fish produced in Russia. </p> <p> Monday Dawn, with its shafts of light and hints of redemption, doesn't really happen in Moscow. At some point the black of night dissolves into the gray of day. Long trucks full of beets, cabbage and the first spring melons start rumbling across the broken pavement to their destinations at scores of city markets. People rouse themselves, drink tea, then shuffle across the snowy ground to 500 trolley stops and subway stations. </p> <p> Because this is a Monday, Chalva Tchigirinsky, a real-estate developer, slips into an immaculately tailored gray-checked suit from Harrods, slides into the back of his silver Mercedes and -- trailed closely by a chase car carrying three bodyguards -- begins the hourlong ride from the dacha he rents for $35,000 a month to the center of the city he is trying to rebuild. As always, he has spent the weekend out among the century-old stands of birch trees, sipping French Champagne, relaxing in a sauna that was once visited by Stalin and taking a break from the furious intensity of his normal routine in this, one of the world's most furiously intense cities. </p> <p> Monday Dawn, with its shafts of light and hints of redemption, doesn't really happen in Moscow.

Yeltsin was practically a dead man. Desperate to win a second term,  and to vanquish Communism in Russia for good, Mr. Yeltsin had a heart attack in the middle of the campaign and promptly disappeared from sight. </p> <p> He won anyway, but by his inauguration last August many Russians were convinced that the feeble, robotic leader who struggled so visibly just to take the oath of office was through. Jokes comparing Mr. Yeltsin to Leonid I. Brezhnev -- the ultimate symbol of fossilized Russian rulers -- became common. For many critical months no new laws were passed, no initiatives were offered and nobody ran the country. </p> <p> The leaders of the eight countries that together represent about half of the world's economic activity called today for rapid democratic elections in Hong Kong, renewed energy to break the stalemate in the Middle East, a new commitment to peace in Bosnia, and new aid for Africa. </p> <p> But in a sharp dispute with France and other European nations that dominated this morning's final session of ''The Summit of the Eight,'' President Clinton refused to commit the United States to a specific reduction in the emission of carbon dioxide and the other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming, agreeing only to ''substantial reductions'' by 2010. </p> <p> An unusually calm and apparently forthright Boris N. Yeltsin, speaking to the Russian people on the anniversary of his re-election as President, asserted today for the first time that the battered Russian economy had finally emerged from its stark, five-year plunge into darkness. </p> <p> ''That is it,'' Mr. Yeltsin announced today in a radio speech to the nation. ''We have reached the point when it is possible for production to go up. The decline has been stopped.'' </p> <p> Combining Western financial expertise with Russian political and economic power, two of the nation's most influential financiers have joined forces to establish Russia's largest investment bank. </p> <p> The new company will merge the Renaissance Capital Group with the International Company for Finance and Investment, which is now Russia's fifth-largest bank. </p> <p> The burning issue for Russians these days is not NATO expansion or President Boris N. Yeltsin's health. It is Mr. Yeltsin's plan to end housing and utility subsidies. </p> <p> In a politically risky move that has galvanized much of Russia, Mr. Yeltsin is pressing to phase out the enormous subsidies by 2003. The logic is clear. Six years after the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia has emerged with an economy that is part free market and part socialist. Prices for food and clothing have soared, often exceeding those in the West. But most Russians still pay a pittance for shelter, leaving cash-strapped local governments to pick up most of the tab. </p> <p> Overcoming efforts by Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin to delay the sale, one of Russia's most powerful banks plunged ahead today with an auction for one of the state's most valuable assets. </p> <p> Not surprisingly, since a subsidiary of Oneksim Bank was managing the bids, Oneksim Bank won 38 percent of Norilsk Nickel, one of the world's largest producers of nickel, copper and platinum. </p> <p> When Russia sold off a 25 percent share of the state's vast telephone and telecommunications monopoly last week, the Government proudly held up the deal as a model of fair play in the free market. </p> <p> This was different from previous  efforts to privatize huge state assets: the highest bid ($1.9 billion) actually won the auction. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia announced today that as of Jan. 1, his Government will erase the starkest symbol of the country's runaway inflation by changing the denomination of the ruble, in effect lopping off three zeros. </p> <p> The exchange rate for new bills will be approximately 6 rubles to the dollar. Right now, the rate is about 6,000 rubles to the dollar. </p> <p> Five years ago, with the Russian economy in a deep depression and people overcome by fear and confusion, Lena Volkovskaya made a solemn vow to herself. </p> <p> ''I promised I would never have children,'' the 32-year-old lawyer recalled recently. ''My friends were all the same way. There was no money here and no future here. It seemed very scary to me. We all decided that you would have to be crazy to bring a baby into this world.'' </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin said today that Russia's economic development was being jeopardized by powerful business interests and vowed the Government would play a stronger role to insure free competition. </p> <p> ''We have learned from our own experience that the market by itself is not a cure-all,'' Mr. Yeltsin said in a major economic address. ''Everyone agrees today that it is necessary to increase the state's role in the economy.'' </p> <p> The World Bank forecast today that growth in developing countries would accelerate over the next decade, and that the five biggest emerging economies -- China, India, Indonesia, Brazil and Russia -- would become economic powerhouses in the next quarter-century. </p> <p> The bank forecast that growth in developing nations would surge to an average of 5.4 percent a year through 2006, up from 4.5 percent last year and 2.3 percent from 1991 through 1995. </p> <p> Bank stocks plunged yesterday on fears about big banks' exposure to hair-raising drops in overseas markets, especially in Latin America. But traders and bankers say the Chase Manhattan Corporation, the nation's largest bank, may be facing significant losses, at least on paper, in a currently less-noticed part of the world -- Russia. </p> <p> Bank stocks have been under pressure recently as investors' fears have mounted about the banks' exposure to weaknesses in the economies of Asian, Latin American and Eastern European countries. Many of the biggest United States banks are active traders in the currencies and securities issued in those countries and for many years enjoyed robust returns. But since the financial crisis began in Southeast Asia this summer, all emerging markets have been whipsawed. </p> <p> Russia's former privatization chief is being accused of receiving a bribe in a politically explosive case that has cast a cloud over the Yeltsin Government's program to sell billions of dollars in state assets. </p> <p> The Moscow prosecutor's office disclosed today that it was investigating a $100,000 book advance paid to the former official, Alfred R. Kokh, who was head of the privatization agency until mid-August. </p> <p> BILL BROWDER started buying Russian stocks before there was a stock market here. It was 1993, the year President Boris N. Yeltsin defeated Communist hard-liners by shelling the Parliament. Industrial output was collapsing; inflation was rampant. </p> <p> Investing? Russians with money were smuggling billions of dollars out of the country. There were no exchanges, no prospectuses, no earnings reports and almost no earnings. </p> <p> Averting a political crisis, President Boris N. Yeltsin tonight staved off a parliamentary vote of no confidence in his Cabinet that could have severely undercut his economic reform effort. </p> <p> As faction leaders debated whether to put a no-confidence bill to a vote, Mr. Yeltsin telephoned the Parliament floor twice from the Kremlin, warning the deputies to desist. </p> <p> The architect  of Russian economic reform  the free-market crusader who also promised to rid the country of its entrenched corruption -- is now reeling under scrutiny of his own ethical conflicts. </p> <p> The crusader, First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly B. Chubais, 42,  barely survived a purge last week of  three of his closest aides and allies who were involved with him in a questionable $450,000 book deal.  Even if he manages to stay in office -- and, for now, President Boris N. Yeltsin seems to have concluded that Russia's fragile economy cannot afford his loss -- Mr. Chubais's credibility has been badly damaged. </p> <p> Seeking to end an ethics scandal that is threatening economic reform, President Boris N. Yeltsin appointed a new Finance Minister today to replace the embattled Anatoly B. Chubais. </p> <p> Mr. Chubais, who had held that post along with his broader duties as First Deputy Prime Minister, was stripped of the Finance Ministry job earlier today. But he remains in charge of the economy. </p> <p> Seeking to squash a growing ethics scandal that could derail Russia's economic reforms, President Boris N. Yeltsin offered today to strip the embattled first Deputy Prime Minister, Anatoly B. Chubais, of his second post of Finance Minister. </p> <p> The proposal, made by Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin to parliamentary leaders today, would keep Mr. Chubais in Government, while giving the appearance of clipping his wings. It was aimed at mollifying a hostile Parliament that is baying for Mr. Chubais's dismissal before a vote on the 1998 budget. </p> <p> In an apparent effort to loosen the stranglehold of the Russian oligarchy, President Boris N. Yeltsin dismissed one of Russia's most powerful tycoons from high Government office today. </p> <p> The removal of Boris A. Berezovsky from his position as deputy secretary of the National Security Council was the most dramatic power play yet in a vicious, continuing battle between the bankers who financed Mr. Yeltsin's re-election and the team of economic reformers the President appointed after he won. </p> <p> A roiling scandal over a hefty publishing advance taken by First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly B. Chubais, Russia's most prominent reformer, deepened today when President Boris N. Yeltsin dismissed one of Mr. Chubais's co-authors from his Kremlin job. </p> <p> The presidential press service tersely announced today that Aleksandr Kazakov, a former privatization chief and the President's deputy chief of staff, was dismissed with no public explanation. He is also the chairman of Gazprom, the state-owned gas monopoly. Mr. Kazakov, Mr. Chubais and three others were promised $90,000 each for their contributions to a history of privatization. </p> <p> Worried that the global economic turmoil could overwhelm its financial system, Russia is quietly seeking American support for an expanded program of Western assistance, government officials and private bankers said. </p> <p> The purpose of the aid would be to strengthen confidence in Russia's Central Bank, which has been using up its reserves in an anxious effort to prop up the ruble. </p> <p> Russia has got Thailand disease, and I'm not talking about the flu. </p> <p> Most Russians walking the streets here don't realize that their country's been infected by the Asian contagion. They will know soon, because if the Asian crisis slams into Moscow with the virulence that some brokers here fear, the ruble could be rubble. </p> <p> Valery Timoshenko, a quiet man and a film maker, prefers to be behind the camera. But there he was in front of it, gesticulating at what he called the scene of a future crime. </p> <p> The place looked innocent enough, a perfect half-moon bay along the Black Sea lined with hills and trees, a rare stretch of unspoiled nature. But a partnership of Russian and Western oil companies has plans for this stretch of beach, eight miles from the city's harbor. </p> <p> ''You've got to be the dumbest lawyer in Eastern Europe,'' I needled Daniel Arbess when we met in 1991. The 30-year-old Canadian-born lawyer from the Wall Street firm White & Case was helping the reform Government of Czechoslovakia solicit bids from foreign investors interested in buying state-owned enterprises. ''Smart'' lawyers worked for the foreign investors who controlled the money, but Arbess harbored a more subtle agenda. By helping the Czech Government, he hoped to boost economic reform in the region as well as make money for himself and his law firm -- and the strategy worked. White & Case made a profitable niche for itself by taking the side of former Soviet-bloc countries as they completed their traverse to capitalism. </p> <p> Arbess has come a long way from his days as a young Harvard-educated lawyer in Prague. He now hobnobs with some of Russia's most powerful businessmen, like Boris Berezovsky, and has grown rich buying dysfunctional companies in former Communist countries and turning them into profitable businesses. That Arbess is making money is insignificant (except to him); his investments also serve a greater social purpose. </p> <p> This is not the way Lena Usikova planned to usher in the new year. Clutching a fistful of dollars she had rescued from a hiding place in her three-room apartment, the bleary-eyed schoolteacher pawed the fresh snow as she waited for her grocery store to open for business. </p> <p> ''I don't know which rubles to use,'' she wailed, crossing her gray eyes in disgust. ''The old ones are bad, but could the new ones possibly be any better? I'm using dollars. At least you can't go wrong with them.'' </p> <p> In a special Government meeting that was half encounter group and half stagey show trial, President Boris N. Yeltsin lashed out at his Government for failing to correct the country's ailing economy and threatened a Cabinet shake-up. </p> <p> ''We are going to sum up 1997 by naming specific culprits,'' Mr. Yeltsin warned sternly in a televised speech today. ''By the end of the session we may be short of three Government members.'' </p> <p> When Lena, 20, arrived at a seedy hotel here after a call from the Amazonka escort service dispatcher, she felt fortunate. The client took one look at her waist-length, platinum-blond hair and chose her over the two other prostitutes the dispatcher had sent over for his inspection. </p> <p> But her luck soured when a vice detective knocked on the hotel room door, ordered her to get dressed, and put her into an unmarked police van. The nice young client turned out to be an undercover police officer. </p> <p> Just as Russia appears to have weathered the economic turmoil that has battered Asia it is facing a new threat: falling oil prices. </p> <p> The decline in the world price for oil is expected to result in billions of dollars in lost tax revenue. It is hurting Russia's major oil companies and making it harder for them to make needed investments. </p> <p> When one of Russia's most ardent reformers set out to convert the state-run pension system into a program of private individual retirement accounts, he never imagined that the unabashedly capitalist idea would be rebuffed by the World Bank. </p> <p> The idea was to give Russians more control over their financial future and encourage economic growth. The billions of rubles deposited in the accounts would find their way into investments at home. </p> <p> Demonstrating once again his enormous power and his mercurial nature, President Boris N. Yeltsin astonished the nation today by dismissing his entire Cabinet, including his loyal and dedicated aide, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. </p> <p> Even for people who have grown used to Mr. Yeltsin's almost Shakespearean penchant for casting off those closest to him at regular intervals, today's actions seemed difficult to comprehend. </p> <p> MARK GAINS.  The mark rallied to end higher after traders concluded that a Cabinet shake-up in Russia could help economic relations with Germany. The dollar cost 1.8256 marks in New York, down from 1.8302 Friday. </p> <p> Ever since President Boris N. Yeltsin was re-elected in 1996, the battle for Russia has been portrayed as a bitter struggle between a small group of tycoons who bankrolled his campaign in exchange for insider privileges, and the band of economic reformers he appointed to rein in those powerful bankers and businessmen. </p> <p> No political decision is made in Russia without setting off an explosion of conspiracy theories. When Mr. Yeltsin dismissed his entire Cabinet today, including his loyal Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the question was not just why, but who was really behind the decision. </p> <p> The shadowy battle over the future of the Russian Government has burst into the open as a struggle that is less about ideology, Boris Yeltsin's health or even the qualifications of his choice for Prime Minister than about who will control economic policy. </p> <p> After weeks of bitter infighting, the terms of the battle were laid out openly today in a newspaper controlled by one of the country's most powerful tycoons. The newspaper outlined conditions for a resolution of the fight over President Yeltsin's Cabinet that would undermine the nation's most prominent market reformers. </p> <p> Bronislaw Geremek, the Foreign Minister of Poland, is an ineffably polite man and a practiced listener. But there are occasions that try his patience. </p> <p> After hearing some platitudes over a copious lunch from his counterpart in neighboring Belarus about how the authoritarian Government there held no political prisoners, Mr. Geremek, a dissident during Poland's Communist era, replied crisply, ''That's what they used to say in Poland when I was in prison and being called a hooligan who spied for the United States.'' </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin's opponents in Russia's fractious legislature abruptly abandoned their posture of defiance today and approved his choice for Prime Minister, avoiding parliamentary elections that could have cost many of them their jobs. </p> <p> After weeks of strident threats and sullen rebellion, the lower house voted 251 to 25 to confirm Sergei Kiriyenko, a 35-year-old plucked from relative obscurity, as Prime Minister. The rest of the 450 deputies refused to vote. </p> <p> Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto began a two-day meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia today in an effort to improve economic cooperation and work toward a peace treaty that would finally mark an end to territorial disputes dating from World War II. </p> <p> Both men appeared vigorous and cheerful as they greeted each other with an embrace in the resort town of Kawana, 80 miles southwest of Tokyo. </p> <p> Since winning the race for Mayor last month, Andrei Klimentyev has had some trouble meeting with his constituents. </p> <p> No sooner was his victory announced than the election was annulled and the would-be mayor dragged to jail to face corruption charges. Instead of moving into City Hall, Mr. Klimentyev has been spending his days in a cage in a municipal courtroom, his legal papers stuffed inside a plastic bag. </p> <p> As workers took to the streets this week to demonstrate against the Government's chronic inability to pay back wages, a young Kremlin official huddled with labor leaders to defuse the protest. </p> <p> Even though Moscow has repeatedly failed to make good on its promises to pay the wages, the labor leaders agreed to give it yet another chance. ''Kiriyenko has given us hope,'' said Aleksei Surikov, the deputy head of the National Federation of Independent Trade Unions. </p> <p> As Russian financial markets steadied slightly after this week's record plunge, President Boris N. Yeltsin said today that he would call on Western leaders to help defend Russia's embattled ruble. </p> <p> His appeal was later echoed by a top finance official who said Russia would need a hefty rescue package from the West -- more generous than a $700 million loan already expected from the International Monetary Fund -- if it is to stem the panic that has threatened Russia's economic and political stability. </p> <p> Just when it began to look as if Latin America had dodged the bullet of Asia's financial and economic woes, stock markets from Mexico to Chile began to tumble. The decline, which began in earnest three weeks ago, accelerated earlier this week, ushering in a period of increased volatility, stock market analysts said. </p> <p> Stock trackers are taking note of everything from low commodity prices causing trade imbalances in Venezuela and Chile, to political uncertainty in Argentina, to fears over currency stability in Brazil, to an embarrassing money-laundering bank scandal in Mexico, stormy weather in Peru and disappointing company earnings throughout the region. </p> <p> Russia received a boost today when the International Monetary Fund said it would disburse $670 million by the end of June. That, along with conditions the I.M.F. placed on the Government, should be enough to stabilize the Russian financial markets,  fund officials said. </p> <p> ''The Government's economic policies are wholly coherent, and there is no reason for devaluation,'' said John Odling-Smee, the I.M.F.'s chief expert on Russia. </p> <p> After  months of high-stakes maneuvers, the long-awaited auction for Russia's last big oil company came to an unceremonious end today. </p> <p> No one bid. </p> <p> This year, for the first time, the annual summit meeting of the world's seven major industrial democracies and Russia became formally known as the Group of Eight, reflecting the gradual effort to give Russia an expanded voice in global economic and political issues. </p> <p> ''The format is now the G-8,'' a spokesman for the British Government said today. ''The idea was always that Russia would be included. It just took a while for the name to catch up with the reality.'' </p> <p> It was a month in the making, but President Boris N. Yeltsin has assembled a new team that is strikingly young, pro-reform and from outside Moscow. </p> <p> The Russian political establishment was stunned when Mr. Yeltsin selected the 35-year-old Sergei V. Kiriyenko last month as his new Prime Minister. After a drawn-out effort to win confirmation for Mr. Kiriyenko from Parliament, Mr. Yeltsin went further by filling out the top ranks of his Government with a squad of young politicians cut from the same cloth. </p> <p> As President Eduard A. Shevardnadze of Georgia was flying home last Sunday from a visit to Turkey, his pilot gave him alarming news. The two Georgian Air Force jets that normally escort the President's plane to guard him against airborne attack were nowhere to be seen. </p> <p> Mr. Shevardnadze's plane landed safely in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, and after an urgent inquiry it turned out that the jets were parked at a nearby Russian base and could not fly because sand had been poured into their engines. Mr. Shevardnadze was outraged and immediately dismissed the Defense Minister, Lieut. Gen. Vardiko Nadibaidze, who is known for his pro-Russian stance. </p> <p> MARK DROPS. The German currency fell in reaction to the economic crisis in Russia and its possible impact on Germany, Russia's biggest lender and trading partner. The dollar rose to 1.7829 marks in New York from 1.7705. </p> <p> The financial panic that struck Russia today had distinctly Russian causes: the Government cannot collect taxes, it suffers from an economy that is nearly moribund and it has an untested new economic team. But in Washington the Russian crisis looks very much like the next phase of the Asian crisis. </p> <p> In fact, the two are related. In recent days, as President Suharto was being toppled in Indonesia, the yen was falling in Tokyo and workers were striking in South Korea against long-delayed layoffs, investors began to fear that Asia's troubles were far from over and could easily spread to other emerging markets. </p> <p> Investors stampeded in and out of financial markets around the world yesterday, raising new concerns about the global reverberations of the Asian economic crisis that began nearly a year ago. </p> <p> Such heightened uncertainties helped further deflate a financial rebound in developing countries that began earlier this year. Now, the outlook for these emerging markets has grown even cloudier because of severe problems in Russia. </p> <p> It can't happen here, but assume our Dow average were to drop substantially. Not just the 10 or 15 percent correction customary after big run-ups, but all the way down to 4,000. What would our reaction be? </p> <p> After the disbelieving shock would come the rage. Fingers would point at economists who failed to foresee, corporate merger maniacs, bankers and brokers, at surplus budgeteers and muckraking journalists. </p> <p> As Russia's financial markets teetered on the brink of collapse, Moscow mounted a drastic effort today to preserve the value of its currency and stem the exodus of foreign investors. </p> <p> In a quick series of steps to address the new Russian Government's most serious economic crisis, officials tripled interest rates, announced that they would be willing to accept a far lower price for the sell-off of Russia's last big oil company, and appealed for support from the International Monetary Fund. </p> <p> As troubles continue to rain down on Russia's new Government, President Boris N. Yeltsin, himself now facing the latest in a series of impeachment votes, tried today to reassure jittery investors that the country would not shift off its ''balanced, finely tuned course.'' </p> <p> The week began with a sharp drop on Russia's financial markets, where prices fell 12 percent Monday. On Tuesday, the market steadied after the Central Bank spent more than $500 million to protect the ruble and raised refinancing rates to 50 percent from 30, an increase that will bite into Russia's already overextended budget. </p> <p> Shaken by global financial turmoil, Russia tried to assure anxious investors today that it would not follow the path of Indonesia and other faltering Asian economies. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin summoned leading bankers and industrialists to an unusual Kremlin meeting this week on ways to end the financial crisis. </p> <p> The Russian Government announced today that it would seek $10 billion to $15 billion in additional assistance from the International Monetary Fund. </p> <p> Russia has been quietly negotiating with I.M.F. representatives for weeks over conditions for additional aid. But today marked the first time that it has publicly declared its position. ''I think there should be serious talk about resources in the range of $10 billion to $15 billion,'' said Anatoly B. Chubais, the Government's new representative for talks with the International Monetary Fund. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin gathered the nation's most powerful businessmen at the Kremlin today and pressed them to use their money to help steady Russia's financial markets. </p> <p> ''When our own investors do not put their money in, foreigners leave,'' Mr. Yeltsin warned the businessmen. ''If you want foreign investors to put their money in, you must put in yours.'' </p> <p> Raising the money that it needs each week to pay off debt that is coming due and finance its persistent budget deficit has always been a tricky proposition for Russia, given its tumultuous political and economic climate. </p> <p> But the job will be particularly difficult on Wednesday, when the Government needs to raise $1.2 billion from the financial markets in the face of near panic among domestic and foreign investors about Russia's ability to maintain the value of its currency and honor all its debts. </p> <p> Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin warned today that unless Russia's financial crisis is resolved, its economic troubles ''could spread to Central Europe,'' placing two major regions -- Asia and Europe -- in simultaneous downturns. </p> <p> In his first statement since President Clinton said on Sunday that the United States would support an international bailout of Russia, Mr. Rubin chose his comments carefully to avoid worsening the flight from Russian and Asian currencies. </p> <p> As Congressional Republicans and human rights advocates deride President Clinton for visiting China, they might ask themselves the following question: since 1989, which system has improved the lives of its citizens more, China's one-party dictatorship or Russia's multiparty democracy? </p> <p> Whether the measure is personal freedom or economic gain, the answer is China's dictatorship. China's rulers have overseen the formation of a capitalist society, where wealth is created at the bottom by individual entrepreneurs. A middle class of tens of millions is beginning to emerge, and along with that, personal freedoms have expanded for homosexuals, unmarried couples, young parents and entrepreneurs. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, seeking to forestall a NATO military incursion in the Serbian province of Kosovo, promised today to undertake a personal diplomatic effort with the Serbian leadership in an effort to defuse the violence there. </p> <p> Speaking after a day of talks with  Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, Mr. Yeltsin said NATO action would ''destabilize the situation in the Balkans with unforeseeable consequences for all of Europe.'' </p> <p> The Yeltsin Government began its long-overdue fight against tax evasion today by arresting the country's top statisticians and accusing them of manipulating data to help Russian companies avoid taxes. </p> <p> The head of the State Committee for Statistics, Yuri Yurkov, and his top deputies were arrested in raids on Monday night. </p> <p> Both the greatest opportunity and the greatest danger for the United States internationally may well still lie in Russia. If we do not soon seize the opportunity, the danger will increase -- and could present us with the most serious threat to basic global stability since the end of the cold war. </p> <p> The recent financial turmoil and labor unrest are signs of danger. The West's response -- yet another International Monetary Fund bailout -- shows that we are helping the reformers fight, and sometimes win, battles. But we are not winning the war. We may not even have a strategy, because we have not understood the extent and depth of either the material transformation or the spiritual demoralization of the Russian people since the fall of Communism. </p> <p> YET another emerging market economy has been forced to the brink by financial panic. And yet again the International Monetary Fund is riding to the rescue. </p> <p> Only this time around the economy at risk is Russia, which is far more feeble yet far more important in geopolitical terms than the Asian Tigers. And the drumbeat is growing from critics of the I.M.F., which places an enormous premium on stabilizing currency exchange rates, sometimes at very high costs. </p> <p> There is nothing like a crisis to propel Boris N. Yeltsin into action, and the bottoming out of Russia's financial markets in recent weeks did the trick once again. </p> <p> Night after night, the 67-year-old President has been shown on television, filling the airwaves with proof of a crisis-packed schedule, meeting in turn with media chiefs, bankers and Government officials, threatening and cajoling each group with his familiar bluster. </p> <p> Russia's unsteady economy survived a critical test today as the Government sold nearly $1 billion in Treasury bills without paying the colossal interest rates that the bonds traded at just a week ago. </p> <p> Anxious foreign investors, fearing the Treasury bill auction would fail to draw enough investors, breathed a sign of relief. While the auction did not raise all the money the Government sought, it was judged a moderate success. Stock prices rose in Russia for a second day. But a more skeptical bond market was mixed. </p> <p> MARK WEAKENS.  Concerns mounted about weakness in Russia, where German banks and companies have significant investments, pressuring the mark. The dollar surged to 1.8105 marks, from 1.7992 marks on Thursday. </p> <p> The International Monetary Fund warned Russia today that it does not plan to provide the $10 billion to $15 billion in additional assistance that the Kremlin is seeking. </p> <p> Stanley Fischer, the fund's second-ranking official, said the request, announced on Thursday, was for ''a lot of money, more than the I.M.F. can give to one economy.'' Mr. Fischer spoke at a news conference in Sao Paulo, where he is attending a seminar on Brazil's economy. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia appointed Anatoly B. Chubais today as his special representative to negotiate with the International Monetary Fund, which is sending a team to Russia on Monday to discuss the possibility of a new multibillion-dollar loan to help stabilize the country's financial markets. </p> <p> Mr. Chubais, a former first Deputy Prime Minister who currently heads Russia's electrical power monopoly, has great credibility in Western financial circles because of his reputation as a free-market advocate and because he is regarded as an able manager and administrator. </p> <p> Russia's Prime Minister said in a television interview tonight that the country ''so far'' did not need emergency international loans to pull itself out of its financial crisis. </p> <p> President Clinton said today that the United States would support new international financial assistance for Russia if it was unable to meet short-term debts. Although the interview with Prime Minister Sergei V. Kiriyenko, broadcast tonight on a popular Sunday news program, had been taped before Mr. Clinton's statement, the President's support had  been sought by key members and backers of the Russian Government. </p> <p> Fearing a meltdown of the Russian currency that could threaten the stability of President Boris N. Yeltsin's Government, President Clinton said today that the United States would support new international financial aid if Russia is unable to meet its short-term debts. </p> <p> Mr. Clinton's statement, made after a tumultuous week in which investors fled the Russian ruble, appeared to pave the way for a new bailout of Russia by the International Monetary Fund. While American officials refused to talk about the size of any new program, or when it might begin, outside experts said Russia could need upward of $10 billion to make up for huge shortfalls in oil revenues and tax collections. </p> <p> Russia slashed its sky-high interest rates today in a further sign that calm was returning to its financial markets. </p> <p> The Central Bank raised interest rates, to 150 from 50 percent, last week in a drastic move to defend the ruble. But today the bank reduced the annualized rate, to 60 percent. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin summoned Russian legislators today to an unusual public meeting and demanded that they enact a rash of measures to restore the confidence of foreign investors. </p> <p> The extraordinary session was intended to impress the International Monetary Fund, which is beginning negotiations over billions of dollars in additional financing. </p> <p> The International Monetary Fund has told the Russian Government that it needs to slash its budget deficit and overhaul its antiquated tax system if it wants to qualify for billions of dollars in additional loans, senior Russian officials said today. </p> <p> Among other measures, the fund also wants Russia to strengthen its banking system. And fund officials have even gone so far as to suggest that the operations of Gazprom, the huge natural gas monopoly, be split up. </p> <p> Fresh from two significant, if modest, successes with international lenders, Russia's top leaders expressed hope today that their floundering economy was finally turning the corner toward solvency. </p> <p> Private analysts seemed less sanguine. They said the Government had gained a few months to put its fiscal house in order before it faced another financial crisis like the one that has rocked the nation for weeks. </p> <p> Russian stock prices plummeted again today, a clear indication that investors still doubt whether the Government can make good on a pledge to climb out of its seemingly bottomless hole of domestic and international debt. </p> <p> The Government seemed to underscore its plight by announcing over the weekend that it would raise money by selling part of its controlling stake in the huge Gazprom natural-gas monopoly. </p> <p> Russia's faltering economy and plunging world oil prices prompted the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin today to postpone the sale of its state oil company. </p> <p> Russian officials said tonight that the auction of the company, Rosneft, would be delayed until September or October. It is the second time that the Government has put off the sale because of a lack of bids. </p> <p> Here's Saturday's news quiz: </p> <p> 1. Is there really any difference between Boris Yeltsin and Suharto or between Russia and Indonesia? </p> <p> Vice President Al Gore ended two days of talks here today by declaring his confidence that Prime Minister Sergei V. Kiriyenko will be able to carry out the fiscal reforms needed to make the Russian Government solvent. </p> <p> Mr. Gore's statements came after two days of get-acquainted meetings with Mr. Kiriyenko, who has replaced former Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin as the senior official on a panel that coordinates the two Governments' work on major Russian-American issues. </p> <p> At a news conference with Mr. Kiriyenko, Mr. Gore said his counterpart had ''full command'' of the economic issues ''and a very impressive understanding of economic reform and what must be done in order to advance reform.'' </p> <p> Wearing black ski masks, a phalanx of gun-toting Russian tax police swept into a dingy warehouse this week and confiscated thousands of shiny bottles of vodka complete with phony markings indicating that alcohol taxes had been paid. </p> <p> The tax-cheating owner managed to escape, but Boris G. Fyodorov said he was not discouraged. </p> <p> The board of the International Monetary Fund endorsed a $17 billion emergency rescue plan for Russia tonight and formally approved its own $11.2 billion share. But the fund trimmed back its first payment in an effort to force the reluctant Russian legislature to enact austerity measures. </p> <p> The decision was announced after a closed-door meeting that lasted hours, which seemed to reflect the enormous risk the fund was taking. Russia has repeatedly failed to live up to commitments it made in return for far smaller loans than the program supported today. And on Friday the Duma, the Communist-dominated lower house of Parliament, left Moscow for summer vacation without passing some significant elements of Russia's commitments. </p> <p> The Yeltsin Government said today that it had reached agreement with the International Monetary Fund on a multibillion-dollar package to stabilize Russia's financial markets. </p> <p> ''The sides have achieved agreement on all major questions of principal importance,'' the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin said in a statement. </p> <p> Politicians began jockeying today for the chance to play chief surgeon to the world's second-largest economy after Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto resigned, saying he was responsible for his party's disastrous finish in parliamentary elections on Sunday. </p> <p> Mr. Hashimoto's resignation left a political vacuum at the economic heart of Asia, sending stocks and currencies reeling across the continent today and touching off fears that another chapter could be beginning in the Asian financial crisis. [At midday on Tuesday, the yen was up slightly against the dollar and stock prices were mixed.] </p> <p> The White House today urged Japan's next Government to move quickly to ''restore confidence in Japan's financial system,'' even while Administration officials said they feared that political paralysis in Tokyo greatly complicated efforts to ignite a recovery in Asia and ease pressure on other countries, including Russia. </p> <p> White House officials today spent little time mourning the departure of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, whose slowness to act on economic reforms had been a continuing source of frustration here. </p> <p> The Russian Government and international lenders concluded an agreement today aimed at easing Russia's financial crisis and restoring confidence in its economy. </p> <p> The agreement would provide $17.1 billion in additional loans over the next two years. About $12.6 billion would be delivered this year and another $4.5 billion would be available in 1999. Combined with existing international assistance, the new pact would bring total lending to Russia to $22.6 billion over this year and next. </p> <p> Last year Yegor Gaidar, the architect of Russia's early economic reforms, predicted that by the end of 1998 Russia would be where Poland was at the beginning of 1992 -- that is, well on its way to a market economy. </p> <p> Well, that should not have been his yardstick for the Russian economy. As a former Polish Finance Minister, I believe that if Poland had continued the policies pursued up until 1992 (the infamous ''shock therapy'') we would now be where Russia is today -- that is, in a seemingly permanent financial crisis. ''Shock without therapy,'' as we called it, was Poland's attempt to privatize without a social welfare net. The idea was to liberalize and privatize as quickly as possible. This led to growing poverty and unemployment as well as social and political tension. </p> <p> With billions in Western loans at stake, the Russian Government urged the lower house of Parliament today to pass a package of tax, budget and economic measures, the strings lenders have attached to any additional money. </p> <p> The Parliament passed several new laws designed to instill discipline in the budgeting process and restore confidence in the economy, including legislation that cuts corporate taxes,  encourages foreign investment and simplifies taxes on small businesses. </p> <p> An architect of Russia's fiscal strategy said today that foreign investors needed some good news to stem renewed fears that the Government was losing control of its financial destiny, a belief that has driven stock and bond markets to near-record lows this week. </p> <p> The official, Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, said some important indicators were beginning to move up. He added that the Government would soon begin to issue regular and detailed economic reports to investors that would prove his point. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin went over the head of the International Monetary Fund today and urged Western leaders to support a multibillion-dollar package of aid to defend Russia's currency. </p> <p> Russian officials say they are now seeking $20 billion or more, at least $10 billion of which they hope will come from the I.M.F. The total is $5 billion to $10 billion more than the Government previously said it needs, and the request to the fund is about twice what the fund has spoken of providing. </p> <p> MARK STRENGTHENS.  The mark gained as Russia, with which Germany has close business ties, seemed near an accord with the International Monetary Fund. The dollar fell to 1.8180 marks, from 1.8288 marks on Thursday. </p> <p> MARK WEAKENS.  Traders sold marks on concerns about political inaction in Russia over its economic crisis. Germany is Russia's largest investor. In New York, the dollar rose to 1.8187 marks, from 1.8080 marks on Tuesday. </p> <p> The International Monetary Fund and the Yeltsin Government are negotiating an aid package that may produce less money than foreign investors say is needed to help ease Russia's financial crisis. </p> <p> Russian officials have publicly stated that they need $10 billion to $15 billion in assistance from the fund and other lenders. As Russia's stocks, bonds and currency took a pounding today, some Western investment bankers say Russia may need $20 billion or more to rebuild investor confidence. </p> <p> Stung by his Parliament's rejection of tax-and-spending reforms widely seen as the only way out of Russia's fiscal tailspin, President Boris N. Yeltsin did this weekend what he had long threatened: He decreed reforms on his own. </p> <p> He had little choice. On Monday, the International Monetary Fund will meet to decide whether to lend Russia $5.6 billion to build up the depleted reserves of its central bank. The money is regarded as crucial to stabilizing the value of the ruble and calming panicky foreign investors. </p> <p> The international effort to calm Russia's shaky financial markets began to fall into place today, as negotiators sought to complete talks on more than $12 billion in new loans. </p> <p> The International Monetary Fund has informed Russian officials that it is now prepared to lend about $11 billion, Russian officials said. About half the sum would be provided up front and the rest would be disbursed by the end of this year. </p> <p> The Government's effort to line up preconditions for $17 billion in new loans fell short of its goal today when the Communist-dominated Parliament failed to pass a land code and adopt a series of revenue measures. </p> <p> The International Monetary Fund is to meet on Monday to decide whether to begin distributing $11.2 billion in additional loans to Russia this year. The $11.2 billion is part of a $17.1 billion package of new loans the fund has proposed for Russia over the next 18 months. </p> <p> Stocks buckled yesterday as investors grew increasingly fearful that sickly Asian economies would drive down corporate earnings at United States companies in the second half of the year. </p> <p> The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1.3 percent on the day, closing at 8,462.85. That puts the average 9.3 percent below its July 17 high of 9,337.97 and within shouting distance of a 10 percent correction. </p> <p> Stocks buckled yesterday as investors grew increasingly fearful that sickly Asian economies would drive down corporate earnings at United States companies in the second half of the year. </p> <p> The Dow Jones industrial average lost 1.3 percent on the day, closing at 8,462.85. That puts the average 9.3 percent below its July 17 high of 9,337.97 and within shouting distance of a 10 percent correction. </p> <p> Russia's markets were swept along in a global economic downdraft today. By the end of the day's trading, stocks and Government bonds were selling at near-historic lows -- that is, even lower than on Monday. </p> <p> Some analysts questioned whether the Russians, already embarked on an all-out effort to avert bankruptcy, would be able to rebuild the confidence of world financial markets, which seem to have written them off. </p> <p> Russian leaders, struggling to bail out their nation's banks from billions of dollars' worth of currency and bond deals with Western financial institutions, find themselves caught in an excruciating dilemma. </p> <p> The plans that Government leaders first announced on Monday could cost foreign lenders billions of dollars, a move that could shred Russia's lingering credibility in global financial markets. But if the Government defers to foreign lenders, as it suggested on Tuesday, Russia's banking system would veer closer to collapse. </p> <p> As Russia confronts its worst financial crisis since the collapse of the Soviet Union, with the ruble poised for a free fall, the Acting Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, made a sudden trip to Ukraine to persuade the head of the International Monetary Fund not to cut off its next installment of credits. </p> <p> Alarmed by the ruble's 9 percent drop yesterday, anxious Russians rushed to their banks this morning only to be given mixed signals on when, and how, they can retrieve their savings. An early round of dollar trading on the Moscow currency exchange was voided today for the first time in the history of the exchange, while the value of the ruble dropped 40 percent against the German mark in a single transaction. </p> <p> Russia's effective devaluation of the ruble last week has sent panic throughout the world's emerging markets, with the Latin American economies likely to be among those that suffer the most. </p> <p> The crisis has pummeled the region's markets, caused currencies throughout the region to drop and forced interest rates so high that some bankers are urging customers not to borrow. Analysts are lowering what had been healthy growth estimates for Latin America for next year and perhaps beyond. </p> <p> Boris Berezovsky had been waiting months for this moment of triumph, quietly plotting to depose Russia's earnest Prime Minister, Sergei Kiriyenko. </p> <p> Last Saturday, Mr. Berezovsky went to the White House, the mammoth, Soviet-era Government headquarters that looms over the Moscow River, and there, in a private meeting with Anatoly B. Chubais, one of the Government's most passionate reformers, he told Mr. Chubais that the Kiriyenko team was finished. President Boris N. Yeltsin, the tycoon pronounced, would soon sign a decree dismissing the entire Cabinet. </p> <p> Russia's financial markets rallied today after the Kremlin and the major Western powers indicated that they were working on another round of plans to end the nation's economic crisis. </p> <p> But with banks still shaky and the memory of Thursday's panic still fresh, brokers and analysts said they were not so much optimistic about a solution as relieved that today's markets had not completed the collapse that began the day before. </p> <p> It has been a long time since anyone in this pretty but forlorn city on the Oka River in central Russia heard any good economic news. Local industrial and agricultural production has dropped 22 percent in the last four years. Doctors, teachers and most factory workers have not been paid in months and their salaries, when they get them, are on the average a paltry $110 a month. </p> <p> Bad news, on the other hand, arrives regularly. And this week, while the ruble tumbled, it was coming in by the truckful as shipments of imported goods pulled up to Kaluga's crowded street market with prices on Turkish jackets, Polish boots and Korean blankets already as much as 10 percent higher. </p> <p> Exactly seven years after the abortive military putsch in Moscow that precipitated the collapse of Soviet Communism, Russia confronts yet another crisis. Back then, in August 1991, the consequences of the crisis appeared wholly benign, as it seemed to herald Russia's chance to move toward democracy and a market economy. Today, Russia's prospects are less clear and far more ominous. </p> <p> The current crisis has both political and economic causes. </p> <p> Boris N. Yeltsin, reclaiming a bit of his old defiant nature, insisted on national television tonight that he would serve out his term as Russia's President and that, for him, resignation was impossible. </p> <p> But rumors and reality alike suggested today that his presidency, if it does last, is rushing toward figurehead status. </p> <p> Stock prices fell sharply again yesterday, as continued fears about instability in Russia and economic weakness closer to home produced the worst week for the American stock market in nine years. </p> <p> The Dow Jones industrial average declined 114.31 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 8,051.68. For the week, the Dow industrials were down 5.6 percent. Not since the so-called mini-crash of October 1989, when the Dow fell 7.8 percent, has the bellwether index fallen so far so fast. </p> <p> The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, threw his support today behind what he described as the attempts of Russia's acting Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, to resurrect an austerity plan for Russia. </p> <p> ''He accepts the challenge,'' Mr. Camdessus said, in his first public comment after a hastily arranged meeting with Mr. Chernomyrdin in Ukraine on Wednesday night. ''Mr. Chernomyrdin has told me that he recognizes the validity'' of the monetary fund's program for restoring the Russian economy. </p> <p> Adding to the list of American companies battered by economic turmoil in Russia, three more large banks reported trading losses there, but provided mixed signals about whether financial downturns elsewhere might lead to more widespread losses. </p> <p> As the Russian crisis deepens, volatility in more economically significant countries like Brazil and Argentina is also eating into the profits of some financial concerns doing business there. Indeed, some analysts say there is now ample evidence that the current raft of financial problems extends far beyond Russia's toppling economy. </p> <p> The economic uncertainty in Russia and its reverberations in emerging markets around the globe continued to rattle European stock markets today. </p> <p> The only gains in Europe appeared to come from traders vacating short positions for the weekend. In shorting a stock, traders borrow shares from a broker for a fee and sell them. They hope to replace the shares by buying them at a lower price and pocketing the difference as profit. </p> <p> The Finance Ministers of four economically powerful Western European countries warned Moscow today that the only way out of its current crisis was to make the tough economic changes long urged by the International Monetary Fund. </p> <p> A letter by the four ministers -- from Germany, France, Italy and Britain --to Russia's acting Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, said those steps included enforcement of tax laws that were now widely ignored, and a monetary policy aimed at keeping inflation in check. </p> <p> One statistic stands out to explain the importance of Japan, along with its misery: </p> <p> When trading ended today at the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Japanese stocks this week alone had dropped in value by $241 billion -- a sum that exceeds the size of the entire annual output of the Russian economy at present exchange rates. In other words, in one glum week's work, Japan managed the financial equivalent of erasing Russia from the world map for a year. </p> <p> Which do you think is scarier? Is it that Scott Ritter, the top U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq, quit his job, accusing the U.S. and the U.N. of surrendering to Saddam Hussein? Or is it the story told by Russian economists about a Russian soldier behind the Urals who drove his army tank to City Hall to demand months of back pay? The soldier said he drove the tank not because he wanted to blow up the municipality but because he didn't have any other way to get there and couldn't afford cab fare. Or is it reading The Washington Post, where a State Department spokesman, James Foley, was quoted as saying that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright couldn't possibly be going soft on Iraq because, after all, ''Saddam Hussein has called Secretary Albright a snake and a witch, among other things''? </p> <p> What these disturbing stories suggest is that the basic pillars that have stabilized the post-cold-war world are all either shaking or crumbling. And that's scary. </p> <p> She only arrived in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, from Moscow two weeks ago, but Natalia Kuznetsova has followed the crisis at home by telephoning friends. She knows that the banks are closed, that the stores are closed, that the ruble is practically worthless. Her friends tell her they pass the days drinking vodka. </p> <p> But even as Ms. Kuznetsova in one breath compares daily life in Russia to a war, in the next breath she smiles and shrugs at the financial and political upheaval in Moscow that has rippled across the world. She said she hoped to stay in the United States for a year or longer, but the thought of returning home did not bother her. </p> <p> Stepping up pressure on Russia to follow through on its long list of promises to foreign creditors, a top official from the International Monetary Fund ended a previously unannounced round of meetings in Moscow this evening with a warning to the Russian Government that its actions this month would be carefully scrutinized. </p> <p> After a final meeting with Anatoly B. Chubais, Russia's liaison with the international financial community, Stanley Fischer, the fund's deputy managing director, said Russia was so far keeping the commitments it made during last month's negotiations over an I.M.F.-led package of $22.6 billion in credits. </p> <p> During such a tumultuous week, it might be expected that people here were preoccupied by the American missile attack in neighboring Afghanistan. After all, dozens of Pakistanis were among those killed in the barrage that fell on what the United States says were terrorist training camps. </p> <p> But this is not the case, for people in this country have concerns far more immediate. </p> <p> With President Clinton's arrival for a summit meeting just days away, Russia's ad-hoc leadership sought to telegraph a message of stability today, saying neither economic crisis nor political bargaining with Communist legislators foreshadows a return to Soviet-style fiscal policy. </p> <p> The West continued to react coolly, its leaders repeating that nothing short of a thorough economic overhaul will win their approval for further loans to the Government. </p> <p> FROM the standpoint of the United States economy, Russia does not matter.'' </p> <p> That was the line coming from American stock market optimists until late last week. Their research reports and market comments painted a benign picture of Russian turmoil, at least as it concerned Americans. Of all United States exports, the reasoning went, less than 1 percent were to Russia. The Russian economy was no larger than that of the Netherlands. Few people invested their money there and those who did knew they faced high risks. </p> <p> President Clinton plans to depart for Moscow on Monday hoping to repair his scandal-stained image while offering comfort -- but no aid -- for the wounded President of Russia, Boris N. Yeltsin. </p> <p> Not since 1974 has an American President gone to Moscow in such a weak domestic position. President Nixon met with Leonid I. Brezhnev in late June of that year as the final chapters of the Watergate scandal were unfolding. The summit meeting gave a fleeting impression of an active President engaged in the international arena, but nothing of substance was accomplished. Five weeks after returning to Washington, Mr. Nixon resigned in disgrace. </p> <p> While many American portfolios have been caught in the backlash of the financial storms in Asia and Russia, European portfolios, as a group, have chalked up far more impressive returns. </p> <p> Not that they have escaped unscathed; the France Growth fund, for example, which had risen 40.5 percent this year through July, was up just 15.48 percent as of Thursday. But compare that with the 3.26 percent gain of the Dow Jones industrial average. </p> <p> Losses, losses, who's got the losses? </p> <p> That is the parlor game for investors and traders as they try to plumb the damage sustained by American financial institutions from the mess in Russia. That nation's devaluation and de facto default on its debt on Tuesday roiled markets worldwide. </p> <p> While a few domestic banks came clean late last week about their Russian exposure -- Republic New York with a $110 million loss, BankAmerica with $220 million and  BankBoston with $10 million -- the silence from many other financial institutions is deafening. </p> <p> By Monday this week, the owner of Shury-Mury, a popular downtown Moscow restaurant that offers a country atmosphere and Russian cuisine, had made his decision: his prices would have to go up. </p> <p> By the time he changed the menus yesterday, the cost of his baked sturgeon and blinis filled with red caviar had shot up by 30 percent. </p> <p> The last time Viktor S. Chernomyrdin took the reins of the Russian Government from a brash band of reformers, in December 1992, he said nothing would change. </p> <p> ''I am for deepening the reforms; there is no way back,'' Mr. Chernomyrdin pledged then, hours after President Boris N. Yeltsin dismissed his chief economic adviser, Yegor Gaidar, and made Mr. Chernomyrdin Prime Minister in his place. But things did change: By 1995 economic reform was near a standstill and Mr. Chernomyrdin let it be known that he thought Western market theory had done ''more harm than good.'' </p> <p> What can you say about a President who dismisses his Cabinet, then reappoints the Prime Minister he replaced five months ago, at a moment when his country is teetering on the edge of financial collapse? </p> <p> If nothing else, the latest surprise move by President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia is widely seen as an act of desperation, carried out at a moment when his political credibility and clout were in danger of being swept away by Russia's latest financial shock waves. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin today dismissed his five-month-old team of economic reformers and reinstalled Viktor S. Chernomyrdin as Prime Minister in an anxious bid to shore up his political support. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin's surprise decision came just five months after he derided Mr. Chernomyrdin as a spent force and cast him out of the Government. </p> <p> As a branch  manager of one of Russia's largest  banks  one of the commercial banks rumored to be on the brink of collapse in the latest wave of Russia's financial crisis -- the young man with a baby-face was frankly worried. </p> <p> So were his depositors, who all morning Friday had been coming in asking to get their money out. Yes, but only in a few days, they were told. Some pressed further. Had the Central Bank stepped in to the rescue with a new infusion of credits, as some newspapers had reported that morning? </p> <p> As Russia searches for a new Government and a program to pull the nation out of a tailspin, a fresh wave of panic swept through the country's financial institutions today. The currency plunged about 9 percent, three banks announced a merger to shore up their stability and the Government unveiled a plan to stretch out the repayment of its debt. </p> <p> Coming at a moment when Russia's newly designated Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, was still negotiating with the Parliament over the makeup of his new Government, the ruble's abrupt drop stoked new fears of inflation similar to the spiraling rates that plunged Russia into a depression in the early 1990's. </p> <p> There is something about Russia's financial crises that won't quit, no matter how much money is thrown at them, no matter how hard the Government tries to do what its creditors expect. </p> <p> Less than one month after the International Monetary Fund promised a package of $22.6 billion in loans and credit to rescue the ruble from the brink, a new wave of panic has set in, sending shivers through the little that is left of Moscow's shattered financial markets. </p> <p> The growing possibility of a devaluation of the Russian ruble swept the world's markets yesterday. Although the Russians insist there will not be a devaluation, the threat has already led to a major selloff in emerging markets and proved a drag on Wall Street and other major stock markets. </p> <p> But the prospect of immediate shocks in the markets is only the first of many worries. Given all the other problems clouding the world's economic outlook -- such as the falling yen and the deepening woes in the rest of Asia -- Russia's crisis could be a sign of a broadening malaise that would stunt the stubbornly strong economy in the United States. </p> <p> Stock and bond prices plunged today, jarring Russian hopes that the Government could avert a depletion of its finances and a meltdown of the banking system. </p> <p> Capping a week of ominous declines, the major blue-chip index dropped as much as 15 percent this morning before the Federal Securities Commission stepped in and halted trading. The market later recouped all but 6.49 percentage points of the loss, but the blue chips now have lost almost a quarter of their value in seven days. </p> <p> A growing sense of crisis in the Russian economy helped push United States markets lower yesterday. </p> <p> Russia's stock market fell 6.5 percent. At one point, trading was stopped for 35 minutes when losses exceeded 10 percent. The central bank stepped in to protect the ruble and the banking system, but Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's downgraded Russia's foreign debt, which already had been ranked as ''junk.'' </p> <p> It was April when Dmitri Chernikh saw the first ripples of Russia's financial crisis lapping at the door of Galatica, one of Russia's hottest computer software companies. </p> <p> It was not the collapse of the Russian financial markets, or the dizzying leap in interest rates, or even the first uncertain steps of the country's new untested Government that worried Mr. Chernikh or his fellow directors. Like most other young Russian businesses, Galatica, with $8 million in sales last year, does not trade its shares publicly, nor has it ever sought bank loans, rates for which were prohibitive even before the latest financial panic. </p> <p> Tax collectors swooped down on three of Russia's biggest oil companies today, seizing executives' cars, apartments and other assets to hammer home its demand for payment of more than $150 million in back taxes. </p> <p> The seizures copied a highly successful raid six weeks ago on the offices of the natural-gas monopoly Gazprom, Russia's largest corporation and at the time its single biggest tax delinquent. </p> <p> MARK WEAKENS.  The dollar rose against the German mark as traders worried that Russia, with which Germany has close business ties, might soon devalue the ruble. The dollar rose to 1.7855 marks, from 1.7797 on Tuesday. </p> <p> Nina Kostina cheered Boris Yeltsin's ascension to the Presidency in 1991. She voted to re-elect him in 1996. She expected to be comfortablein retirement by now. Instead she is a cleaning woman at the Old Moscow Circus, working 11-hour days and taking home $70 a month -- maybe -- after last week's ruble devaluation. </p> <p> It is better not to ask what she thinks about Mr. Yeltsin's promise today that his latest government shake-up will bring stability to Russia. ''I thought we would live normally,'' she said bitterly, trudging toward a Moscow Metro station as dusk fell this evening. ''He said to wait half a year, wait a year, wait another year. Now I've waited seven years -- and nothing. We don't expect anything better, because there's nothing good. I only count on my own self.'' </p> <p> One day after he dismissed his Prime Minister, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia signaled a new approach to governing today by giving a greater voice to the Communist-led forces in Parliament that have sought to frustrate economic reform. </p> <p> The new power-sharing arrangement is intended to build support for President Yeltsin's new choice for Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. But the move raised fresh questions about whether the Kremlin is retreating from the urgent economic reforms demanded by Mr. Chernomyrdin's predecessor, Sergei V. Kiriyenko, who was ousted over the weekend. </p> <p> It doesn't take much to set off a rumor in Moscow these days, as governments and policies are flipped around like flapjacks on a griddle. </p> <p> It was enough for Boris Berezovsky, a 51-year-old multibillionaire financier with an unquenchable political appetite, to be ''sighted in the vicinity of the office of the head of Government'' today to prompt a headline in an evening newspaper, and a new round of talk about the possible return to power of Mr. Berezovsky, a master intriguer. </p> <p> As Russia staggers through its financial crisis, few countries are watching with more anxiety than Germany. </p> <p> German banks are by far the biggest lenders to Russia, with about $30 billion in outstanding loans. The German Government has guaranteed repayment of most of that money, and stands to lose billions if the loans go completely sour. </p> <p> Russia's Government has come up with a new cure for the country's economic ills: higher taxes. A chorus of Western officials, including International Monetary Fund bureaucrats and Vice President Al Gore during his trip to Moscow last month, have praised the Government's new financial plan, which includes big tax increases, as important steps to advance reform. </p> <p> The problem with this prescription is that the Russian economy produces very little to tax. Russia does need a more rationalized tax code, which might help collect revenue from a handful of oil and gas companies that do generate profits. But the vast majority of Russian companies are bankrupt and have been operating at a loss for several years. </p> <p> With great fanfare, Kremlin aides and Russian lawmakers announced a new accord today that would ease the bitter standoff over power-sharing between President Boris N. Yeltsin and the Communist-dominated Parliament. </p> <p> But within a few hours, the much celebrated breakthrough -- which was intended to pave the way for Viktor S. Chernomyrdin's confirmation as Prime Minister -- broke down, as the nation's political leaders squabbled on national television. </p> <p> Judging by how the grand and improbable alliance between Russia's pro-capitalist leadership and its Communist critics exploded this evening -- on television, spectacularly, in a crossfire of accusations and threats -- one might think these people hadn't a clue about what to do with their country. </p> <p> In fact, President Boris N. Yeltsin's Government and the Communists who run Parliament have plenty of ideas for keeping the country from sliding into insolvency, social chaos and third-world status. The problem is that their ideas are diametrically opposed. </p> <p> Administration officials warily monitored the maneuvering to form a new Government in Moscow today, disturbed by possible signs of backsliding on Russia's commitment to tough economic changes but reluctant to render a verdict until new personnel and policies were in place. </p> <p> American officials avoided definitive comment in advance of President Clinton's arrival in Moscow on Tuesday, for fear of appearing to take sides in what promises to be a delicate negotiation among factions in Moscow over the next several days. </p> <p> Pressure mounted today on President Boris N. Yeltsin to cede some of his powers or even step aside as Russia's political leaders frantically negotiated over fundamental changes in the country's economic policies. </p> <p> Emboldened by Mr. Yeltsin's weakness, his political opponents pushed for a series of steps that would reverse seven years of an uneven transition to a democracy and a market economy. They also proposed to skirt the Constitution by usurping some of the President's powers and leaving him as a ceremonial head of the Government. </p> <p> It was a brief but wild ride for Russia's cowboy banking empires, and, like the economy on which they were saddled, they appear headed for disaster. </p> <p> The banks' importance lies less in their size or conventional banking duties, but in their roles as lenders to the Government and as currency speculators. They gave the Government easy credit and got hooked on the returns, and when things started going really sour two weeks ago, their flight to the dollar made the situation worse. </p> <p> Adding to anxiety about the risk banks are facing around the world, the Republic New York Corporation, considered one of the most conservatively managed banks in the United States, said yesterday that its losses in Russia would wipe out all of its third-quarter earnings. </p> <p> Although Republic, which trades in some of the world's most exotic markets, was the only bank to disclose losses in Russia yesterday, it was hardly the only bank stock to suffer from the fears of shareholders. Investors, reacting to a confluence of real or expected economic downturns in several regions, have concluded that the financial risks facing banks in the near future are too worrisome. They fled bank stocks with a vengeance yesterday. </p> <p> After weeks of hesitation, Canada's central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by a full percentage point today in an effort to halt the slide of the Canadian dollar, which has lost more than 10 percent of its value against the United States dollar this year. </p> <p> Despite the increase in the overnight lending rate to 6 percent, the Canadian dollar swooned again, to 63.34 United States cents in New York, from 63.79 cents on Wednesday, leading many analysts to question the effectiveness of the central bank's actions and to worry about its effect on the national economy. </p> <p> When Russia was the heartland of what Ronald Reagan called the Evil Empire, bent on spreading Communist dogma and power around the globe, the United States developed economic, military and diplomatic weapons to contain and eventually to help eliminate the danger. </p> <p> Now Russia once again constitutes a threat to the rest of the world. Its inability to manage its economy has destabilized stock and currency markets from Moscow to Wall Street. </p> <p> Stock market investors around the world, frightened by the depth of Russia's economic turmoil and its possibly contagious effect on Latin America, rushed for the exits yesterday in search of safer places to put their money. </p> <p> In the worst trading day this year, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.19 percent, or 357.36 points, to close at 8,165.99. The Nasdaq fell 81.72 points to close down 4.62 percent. </p> <p> Fears of an economic meltdown in Russia put heavy new pressures on Central Europe today, but many economists and Government officials said the reaction was driven more by market psychology than economic fundamentals. </p> <p> In Hungary, the Budapest stock exchange plunged a heart-stopping 15 percent, and the central bank intervened to shore up confidence in its currency, the forint. </p> <p> Rather than give Russia a quick infusion of money in an emergency attempt to ease its economic crisis, the International Monetary Fund has apparently decided to take up to a month to consider whether to lend Russia more money. </p> <p> What the fund is pushing for is a Russian commitment to live up to key provisions of a loan agreement worked out in early summer. On the strength of that accord, the I.M.F. lent Russia $4.8 billion and agreed to consider an additional payout of $4.3 billion in late September. </p> <p> An outspoken economic reformer has reportedly left the Russian Government, removing one of the last strong voices for free-market reform in the team being put together by Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov. </p> <p> The future of the official, Boris G. Fyodorov, a former Finance Minister who returned to the Government in the spring to spearhead an aggressive tax collection drive, has been closely watched here and abroad as a sign of whether the Primakov Government will represent a range of economic viewpoints or will tilt heavily toward policies favored by the Communists. </p> <p> Record gains by Brazilian stocks accelerated today, the third consecutive day of a rally that has driven up the market 45 percent. The strong gains were fueled by a growing sense among investors that developed nations would protect Latin American economies from the devastation that has crippled Asia and Russia. </p> <p> In a financial crisis rooted in fear, and feeding on panic, the reality that any international bailout remained somewhat amorphous seemed almost beside the point. President Clinton's speech on Monday calling on advanced countries to support Latin economies, and suggestions in London by officials of the Group of Seven industrial nations of a new economic approach to promote growth in emerging markets, as distinct from a tight monetary policy, were enough for stocks to rally. </p> <p> Tiger Management L.L.C., a well-known hedge fund, and the BankAmerica Corporation, one of the country's largest banks, reported huge losses yesterday in emerging-market investments, evidence that the economic havoc in Asia, Russia and Latin America is continuing to roil United States financial companies. </p> <p> It was the second time BankAmerica reported an emerging-market loss in less than a month. </p> <p> Hours after Russia's Acting Prime Minister finally laid out his program to pull the country out of its economic crisis, Parliament today put off a crucial vote on the new Government until Monday, buying more time for political negotiations. </p> <p> Battling for support from reluctant lawmakers, the appointee, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, spelled out a series of economic remedies for the next four months. Initially the plan would risk soaring inflation by printing money to shore up Russia's troubled banking system, then shift course by pushing the country into what Mr. Chernomyrdin called an ''economic dictatorship,'' where the money supply would be rigidly controlled and failing factories could face bankruptcy for the first time. [Page A8.] </p> <p> The world looks to the International Monetary Fund to stop financial crises. Yet its best efforts are failing. Even apart from the spectacular collapses in Asia last year and in Russia this year, there has been a ''boom in busts'' -- an explosion in the number of countries whose economies have been devastated by simultaneous runs on their currencies and banks. </p> <p> What is worse, some hard-hit countries, like Indonesia and Russia, were operating under a bailout program approved by the fund. The I.M.F., critics say, appears short of ideas to stanch these crises, and short of the money that would even allow it to try. </p> <p> Today might be one of those rare heady days for Russia's post-Soviet Communists, if only someone could say what a post-Soviet Communist is. </p> <p> The Communist Party in Russia's Parliament, the legislature's biggest, used to crumple under President Boris N. Yeltsin's glare. Today it contemptuously threw back his choice of Viktor S. Chernomyrdin as Prime Minister for the second time, demanding the restoration of part of its old power and threatening to block a new government -- and risk bringing Russia to its knees if need be. </p> <p> Working for Russia's central bank has never been easy. </p> <p> In the last five years, a bomb has exploded at one office, an auditor has had his hand broken and his dacha set on fire after investigating a bank, and Sergei K. Dubinin, the chairman, has had shots fired at his home on two occasions. Mr. Dubinin, speaking on state television last year, said the shots were a ''warning from powerful structures,'' which he declined to identify. </p> <p> Russia's Parliament again spurned President Boris N. Yeltsin's choice for Prime Minister today after last-minute negotiations between the Kremlin and a defiant Communist opposition broke down. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin gave no signs of backing down tonight over his nomination of Viktor S. Chernomyrdin as Prime Minister. That set the stage for another debilitating round of political wrangling as the economy continued to reel out of control. </p> <p> Plan A, a $23.6 billion program courtesy of the International Monetary Fund, failed in less than four weeks. Plan B, a devaluation and debt moratorium cobbled together by young Russian reformers, collapsed within days. Neither prevented investors from fleeing or citizens from turning every ruble they have into dollars. </p> <p> Now, Russia's central bank is nearly out of dollars, its banks are out of cash, and its Government is not just in de facto default on its loans, but for most practical purposes, defunct. And those who have ridden to Russia's rescue before -- the I.M.F., the United States, the Group of Seven industrialized democracies -- are ruling out a bailout. </p> <p> While anxiety over Russia's deepening economic crisis spread, Acting Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin said today that he would form an acting cabinet without waiting for parliamentary approval. </p> <p> ''In the current, most grave situation, the country cannot stay without a government,'' he told a meeting of Russian officials. ''Delays and inaction may throw us back several years. This will not happen. We must not allow this under any circumstances.'' </p> <p> Europe and the United States today shunted aside a call from Japan for an emergency meeting of the world's largest economies to deal with Russia's economic crisis. </p> <p> At the same time, leaders in several nations cast about for a fresh strategy to contain virulent outbreaks of economic instability. </p> <p> The current economic turbulence has widened the gulf dividing Republicans over whether to approve new financing for the International Monetary Fund. </p> <p> Congress appeared certain to increase the American contribution to the monetary fund when lawmakers left on a monthlong recess in August. But with the Senate having resumed business this week, and the House due back next week, the new financing is now teetering on the brink with each day's gloomy news. </p> <p> Ripples from Russia's economic crisis are rapidly spreading through other financial markets, as Citicorp, Bankers Trust, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Barclays and Nomura Securities yesterday joined the growing list of companies reporting heavy losses on their Russian business. </p> <p> Citicorp's chairman, John S. Reed, and its president, Victor J. Menezes, said in a statement to employees that they expected earnings for the three months ending on Sept. 30 to be cut by about $200 million because of losses related to Russia. </p> <p> With the rugged stoicism that typifies this vast Siberian territory, Nina V. Popova thought she could ride out Russia's economic storm. </p> <p> But last week tax inspectors barged into her small food shop. After poring through her ledgers, they warned her she had violated Gov. Aleksandr Lebed's new ''anti-crisis'' decree. </p> <p> The Russian Government's most outspoken reformer was ousted from his post today, leaving policy in the hands of a unlikely coalition of Communists, regional leaders and Yeltsin holdovers. </p> <p> The reformer, Boris G. Fyodorov, who was chief tax collector and top economic policy maker, was removed from both positions, the Kremlin said. </p> <p> Russians, long accustomed to uncertainty, have a saying: ''Tomorrow's weather will be announced the day after tomorrow.'' </p> <p> But even that famous unflappablity is challenged by a currency whose value has all the predictability of, well, the weather. In the last week the ruble fell to as little as 5 cents, only to shoot back up to 9 cents yesterday. </p> <p> In selecting Yevgeny M. Primakov for Prime Minister, President Boris N. Yeltsin has picked a wily diplomat and steely opponent of American dominance. </p> <p> There is no question that the choice of Mr. Primakov, a foreign policy strategist and former intelligence chief, is a popular one for the Communist opposition and for Russians who miss the stability of Soviet times. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration today welcomed the nomination of Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov as Russia's next Prime Minister, with officials describing him as a sure-footed survivor whose appointment could help defuse a political and economic crisis that had threatened to bring down President Boris N. Yeltsin. </p> <p> ''Obviously the United States knows and respects the Foreign Minister, Primakov,'' said Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman. ''We've worked closely with him. If ratified by the Duma, we would expect to have a good and close working relationship with Prime Minister Primakov.'' </p> <p> Brazilian markets, caving in under the international financial crisis and the Government's failure over the last four years to make crucial changes, careered toward record losses today, with emergency measures over the last week proving futile to end the slide in investor confidence. </p> <p> As the Sao Paulo exchange fell, whizzing past the 11 percent mark early this morning and past 15 percent at 4:30 P.M., the market here halted trading twice in one day, for the first time in its history. When trading resumed, so did the selloffs, with the market closing down 15.8 percent. </p> <p> The gleaming marble and glass headquarters of MFK Renaissance, one of Russia's leading investment banks, stands as tangible evidence of the financial gold rush that briefly swept through here. Limousines still park by the firm's front doors, which abut the offices of Moscow's pre-eminent power broker, Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov -- quite a change from just three years ago, when MFK Renaissance operated from the spare confines of a former hotel disco. </p> <p> But inside MFK Renaissance, beyond plush royal blue carpeting and elegantly upholstered furniture, the trading floor and its computers are eerily quiet.  And for good reason. Most of the bank's capital has been wiped out, most of its assets are nearly worthless, and the firm, like many other investment banks that not so long ago were speculating in Moscow's booming markets, is scrambling to stay afloat. </p> <p> Washington has been so distracted by President Clinton's troubles, by the slow-motion collapse of the Russian Government and by the continuing meltdown of Asia that few here have had time to consider what could set off the next wave of economic turmoil. </p> <p> But today Washington and Wall Street, two universes rarely in sync, got a taste of what may be coming. </p> <p> Summoned back from a decade of obscurity, a group of Gorbachev-era economists stood outside the gates of the Russian Government building today, awaiting their turn to give advice on how to rescue a floundering economy. </p> <p> Ten years ago, these men were the talking heads of perestroika, the name given to reforms launched by then-Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev -- which in due course, led to the collapse of Communism, the end of the Soviet Union. </p> <p> Sometime next year, if it is unable to raise fresh money or delay payments, analysts expect that Russia will default on as much as $200 billion in foreign debt -- the largest default by any government in history. </p> <p> With only $12.3 billion in cash reserves in the treasury and with Russian companies' pockets virtually empty, the economy is in tatters. About $2 billion in debt comes due by the end of this year, and another $17 billion is due next year. </p> <p> FEW Russians harvested the spoils of Russia's troubled encounter with capitalism as feverishly as Vladimir Potanin, a young Soviet bureaucrat who in a few short years had parlayed his Kremlin ties into a sprawling business empire. </p> <p> As recently as last year, Mr. Potanin was a high-ranking member of Boris N. Yeltsin's Government. At the same time, he controlled a cluster of important Russian financial and industrial companies that employed about 400,000 people, had won the support of Western investors like George Soros, and was a member of a voracious clique of Russian businessmen known as the oligarchs. </p> <p> The economic policy leaders of the world's two largest economies, the United States and Japan, spent hours here Friday night talking about the heightened risk of global recession and a further spread of the turmoil that has engulfed Asia, Russia and now Latin America. But they left this morning with no new plans, and an uneasy sense that Japan and the United States remain on different wavelengths about how quickly countries must act. </p> <p> The discussion over dinner on Nob Hill included Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and Kiichi Miyazawa, the former Prime Minister who reluctantly agreed to take the job of Finance Minister last month during Japan's deepest recession since the end of World War II. </p> <p> With a bitter wind biting at his cheeks on this unusually cold but clear Saturday morning, Yevgeny Ushakov arrived at his local bank branch to find the doors closed. </p> <p> Typically, banks in Russia are open on Saturdays, but they have been closed lately as banks have had to contend with snaking lines of anxious depositors hoping to withdraw their savings. </p> <p> Russia's currency may be tumbling. Its stock market may lie in ruins. But Yevgeny Shulman is used to operating without money. </p> <p> Mr. Shulman's factory churns out valves for nuclear power plants and heavy industry. What his company receives in return is clear from a stroll around headquarters: Newly minted cars and trucks are lined up near small mountains of railroad car brake pads and raw metal. </p> <p> For a coun try that has not had a government  for a week  a week in which its currency plummeted and its banking system veered toward collapse --  there was a striking lack of urgency to the debate today in the Russian Parliament. </p> <p> Granted, the vote against confirmation of Viktor S. Chernomyrdin as Prime Minister was a foregone conclusion, after the Communist opposition pulled back from a power-sharing agreement on Sunday that would have salvaged his candidacy. </p> <p> Russia's Parliament today emphatically rejected President Boris N. Yeltsin's choice for Prime Minister after a rancorous  debate, leaving the nation virtually rudderless in the midst of its deepening economic crisis. </p> <p> Viktor S. Chernomyrdin implored lawmakers to approve his appointment as Prime Minister, saying he urgently needed to start forming a new government. </p> <p> In the eyes of many of his fellow leaders and ordinary people around the world, President Clinton has lost personal stature since investigations into his private life and his admission of an inappropriate relationship with a White House intern. But he has lost little of the authority and power conferred on him by the Presidency. </p> <p> Some, particularly in the Muslim world, fear that Mr. Clinton no longer has the moral authority to use his power in ways they would like to see. </p> <p> Russia's top network news program, ''Vremya,'' led off tonight with Parliament's rejection of Viktor S. Chernomyrdin as Prime Minister, the ruble's continued wobbliness and the anniversary of Diana's death. Then it flagged fascinating plans by Muslim extremists for several villages in rural Dagestan. </p> <p> And oh, yes -- the President of the United States arrives Tuesday morning for a summit meeting with the President of Russia, Boris N. Yeltsin. That item was relegated to the second half of the newscast. </p> <p> The demons of financial crisis are haunting Latin America again, unleashed by tumult in Russia, Japan and, now, the United States. Markets and currencies across the region are sinking as panicky investors retreat to the safe haven of American Treasury bonds and dollars. </p> <p> Most of the major Latin economies are far better fortified to withstand  external battering than they were four years ago. That was when a disastrous devaluation in Mexico engulfed several Latin economies into what economists, investors and politicians called the tequila effect. Since then Mexico and Brazil have taken sober measures to build foreign reserves and control inflation, while Argentina and Chile persevered in tough programs already in place. </p> <p> On Monday President Clinton declared that in the midst of the greatest economic turmoil in a half-century, ''the industrial world's chief priority today, plainly, is to spur growth.'' The markets soared, figuring that the combination of a Presidential call to arms and a statement issued the same day by the seven largest industrial economies meant coordinated action was on the way -- chiefly a cut in interest rates. </p> <p> By Wednesday afternoon, that hope was dashed. First Germany, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, said that ''there is no endeavor to coordinate interest rate cuts.'' </p> <p> Russia's new Communist-influenced Government indicated today that it plans to satisfy old debts and bail out old friends by printing billions of new rubles, a decision that drew a swift and strong reaction from President Boris N. Yeltsin's old capitalist allies. </p> <p> The deputy head of the central bank said today that the bank intends to bail out many of the nation's bankrupt financial institutions by buying back their multibillion-ruble portfolios of Government bonds and Treasury bills. The Government temporarily froze $40 billion worth of notes when the fiscal crisis erupted last month because it lacked the money to pay investors who hold them. </p> <p> Yevgeny M. Primakov handily won confirmation as Prime Minister from the Russian Parliament today, and signaled a sharp shift toward a more socialist economic model by endorsing two of the Communist Party's hand-picked candidates for top posts. </p> <p> The appointments -- of a moderate Communist who used to run the Soviet state planning agency and a central banker associated with easy money policies and inflation in the early 1990's -- raised questions about the future of economic reform. </p> <p> Russia's leaders offered more assurances today that the country's fiscal crisis could be tamed without provoking high inflation or social unrest. But with key positions in the new Government unfilled, few people seemed to accord the promises much weight. </p> <p> Neither President Boris N. Yeltsin nor his new Prime Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, has settled on a choice for Finance Minister, perhaps the most important post next to Mr. Primakov's. The Finance Minister will carry out many of the Government's crisis measures. </p> <p> Worried that trouble in Moscow is threatening its own dreams, NASA wants to spend up to $660 million over five years to bail out its Russian partner in building a planned international space station, agency officials said yesterday. </p> <p> Key members of Congress immediately faulted the proposal as too expensive, clouding the fate of the biggest science project of all time. But NASA officials argued that the American and Russian programs were now linked so intimately that the Russian effort must be preserved lest the American space program suffer greatly. </p> <p> Five years ago, Raymond Markovich and Paul Heth carried reels of second-run American films on their laps and candy bars and popcorn bags in their luggage on flights from Los Angeles to Moscow, using their credit cards to finance a hotel movie theater here frequented by expatriates. </p> <p> Today, the two operate Kodak Kinomir (Kodak Cinema World), one of the world's top-grossing single-screen cinemas, just blocks from the Kremlin. They plan to open up to 15 multiplexes, with 100 screens in all, over the next five years, in an investment projected at $110 million. They are part-owners of a film distribution company with exclusive rights to Walt Disney and Columbia Tri-Star pictures in Russia, so they should have no problems filling their screens. And they say the financial crisis now shaking Russia has affected neither their plans nor attendance at Kinomir, which continues to play to packed houses. </p> <p> The International Monetary Fund, having bailed out Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and Russia over the last 15 months, is nearly out of money, and Congress is not yet rushing to its defense. But its job is far from complete. </p> <p> The financial crisis that it tried to snuff out in Asia has spread to Latin America and beyond. Investors are still dumping pesos and rubles in a grab for dwindling reserves of dollars, driving up the costs of imports for consumers and depriving economies of desperately needed foreign capital. </p> <p> As President Boris N. Yeltsin pondered for a second day over who would be his next Prime Minister, the Communists threatened today to pursue impeachment if he renominated Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. </p> <p> The warning was meant to induce Mr. Yeltsin to abandon Mr. Chernomyrdin. In Russia's byzantine politics, it was also a defensive maneuver to block the President from dissolving the Parliament. A vote to impeach would prevent the President from dissolving the Parliament for several months, according to the Constitution. </p> <p> Although the Chase Manhattan  Corporation and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette joined the chorus of financial services companies announcing losses on their business in Russia yesterday, investors may soon be able to breathe more easily about the Russian impact. </p> <p> The extent of American banks' exposure to Russia, analysts say, pales in comparison with the hits taken as a result of the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980's. And quick action by several American financial institutions in recent days to mark down their possible losses by as much as 85 percent should limit the damage to their bottom line, analysts said. </p> <p> Russia struggled through another day without a Government; the ruble's value fell again; people had less money than ever, and spirits and fortunes sagged. </p> <p> ''The situation is worse than in 1917,'' the year that the Bolsheviks seized power in a country depleted by war and government indecision, Aleksandr I. Lebed, the regional governor with presidential ambitions, said he told President Clinton today. </p> <p> President Clinton signaled today that the West would step up its aid to Russia if the Kremlin pressed ahead with tough economic reforms. </p> <p> His message, intended to encourage the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin to stick with its pro-capitalist course despite the nation's deepening economic crisis, was the most striking development as a two-day summit meeting ended. It was dominated by a collapsing ruble and a Government paralyzed by its battles with a Communist opposition. </p> <p> Finance Minister Jose Angel Gurria runs an economy that is growing vigorously, with most exports surging and thousands of new jobs opening every day. But ask him whether the Mexican stock market will rise or plunge tomorrow and he shakes his head in bewilderment. </p> <p> ''Ask the Duma; ask Mr. Chernomyrdin,'' Mr. Gurria said in an interview today, referring to President Boris N. Yeltsin's embattled choice for Prime Minister and the house of the Russian Parliament that has so far refused to approve him. </p> <p> The music is still playing and the beer is still flowing, but three weeks into Russia's latest crisis, the good times at the Chesterfield Cafe -- a popular watering hole for Moscow's high-living young professionals -- are running out. </p> <p> ''This is the quietest night of the quietest week,'' said Martin Bainbridge, the Chesterfield's manager, who left London's night club business  two and a half years ago to take part in this city's giddy expansion. </p> <p> Merrill Lynch & Company said yesterday that it lost $135 million in July and August from its business with Russia and other emerging markets, and was now preparing to cut costs after the recent turmoil in financial markets. </p> <p> The losses are expected to reduce the brokerage firm's net income for July and August to an estimated $102 million, according to Merrill, which made its announcement after the stock market closed. In the third quarter ended Sept. 30, 1997, Merrill earned $493 million. </p> <p> Fearful of being swept up in the financial turmoil that has devastated Asia and Russia, officials from nine Latin American nations said today that their economies were basically sound and should not be penalized indiscriminately by panicky investors. </p> <p> Arriving for the start of a two-day meeting with the International Monetary Fund, the officials said that they were not seeking any international financial help, and that they were taking the difficult steps needed to weather a storm that is threatening to batter much of the world. </p> <p> The wasting disease now ravaging Russia's ruble and its banks has begun to infect everyday commerce in shops and groceries, with unsettling implications -- not just for ordinary citizens, but for the Russian Government, which rises and falls on their trust. </p> <p> From personal visits, interviews and anecdotal reports on the Internet and in newspapers, it is apparent that many food markets and hard-goods stores are running out of popular items, from rice to televisions. Moreover, retailers are finding it increasingly hard to replenish their inventories. </p> <p> The Soviet Union leveled the conifers and birches of the west Siberian taiga and threw up this town 34 years ago for one reason only. The red-and-white sign at the outskirts, under the drawing of a coal-cutting tool emblazoned on a birch leaf, sums it up: ''City of Miners' Glory.'' </p> <p> The sign is a lie. There is no glory here, just unrelieved bleakness -- bleakness, and talk of revolt. </p> <p> As the Russian Government today laid out ways to spend its way out of a roiling economic crisis, it also took a harsh line with its international creditors, warning them of a potential default on its long-term debt if more Western aid is not delivered. </p> <p> The stark, almost belligerent tone used today by Aleksandr Shokhin, a Deputy Prime Minister of financial affairs, suggested that Russia is ready to take an offensive, rather than conciliatory, tack in its negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and other creditors as it tries to battle its way out of a widening budget deficit. </p> <p> As foreign holders of Russian debt struggle to recover some of their billions in losses, they have begun blocking Russian bank accounts and other assets overseas, resorting to the courts to unravel a tangled skein of loan, bond and currency-contract defaults. </p> <p> Yesterday, Lehman Brothers Holdings won a court order in London freezing the British bank accounts of two big Russian banks, Inkombank and Unexim Bank. Lehman contends that the two banks defaulted on $110 million of obligations to Lehman and Lehman clients. </p> <p> A senior official of the International Monetary Fund warned today that he would neither submit to ''the blackmail'' of Russian leaders who threatened national default if they are denied billions of dollars in aid, nor let Congress ''impose conditions'' on the fund in return for $18 billion in new contributions from the United States. </p> <p> The comments came as the I.M.F. is facing the most intense criticism in its 53-year history, accused of mismanaging the spreading global financial crisis and misjudging the political effects of its prescriptions. But the senior official, who refused to allow his name to be used, conceded no mistakes on the part of the institution during his 90-minute breakfast with a large group of reporters this morning in the fund's executive dining rooms, three blocks from the White House. </p> <p> Winning approval from Russia's strident and stubborn Parliament on Friday turned out to be an easy day's work for Russia's new Prime Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, the savvy diplomat who has made a career of playing both ends against the middle. </p> <p> Now comes the hard part as the 68-year-old former intelligence chief sorts through the pile of conflicting economic plans and emergency measures he inherited on taking office, and which today continued to pour in from all sides. </p> <p> In the latest example of a leaky ship bailing out sinking boats, the Russian central bank said today that the country's insolvent banks could use about $1.65 billion in precious ruble reserves to enable them to make good on customers' bills and debts that are going unpaid. </p> <p> The ruble has been hopping up and down for weeks now as banks and the Russian Government manipulated its value against the dollar to make it easier for Russian banks to pay off debts denominated in dollars. </p> <p> On the night before Russia's Parliament is to vote again on whether he becomes Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin warned on national television that the nation has entered a fiscal nose dive and that further political squabbling could lead to social chaos. </p> <p> Mr. Chernomyrdin, who has been serving as Acting Prime Minister, also said tonight that the economic situation was so dire that ''no classical anti-crisis measures apply,'' an assessment that seemed intended to defend seemingly contradictory parts of a fiscal platform he outlined on Friday. </p> <p> Vladislav Bulakhov and his young 16-piece chamber orchestra were a big hit when they performed at the prestigious Moscow Conservatory this month. </p> <p> The seats were sold out. The concert hall reverberated with ovations. </p> <p> During the last few months in Russia, no one could be blamed for asking, ''Can this nation be saved?'' </p> <p> In July, the International Monetary Fund sent Russia $4.8 billion to prop up the wildly overvalued ruble. The I.M.F. and the Russian Central Bank did everything possible to prevent devaluation, fearing that it would inhibit foreign investment. In August, the central bank was spending nearly $500 million a day to do so. </p> <p> It's drive time, and Muscovites are heading home after another day of crisis. After the news, all of it bad, an ad comes on the radio. </p> <p> ''The ruble is falling,'' says the cheerful voice from a private dental clinic, ''but with us, at least your teeth will stay in place.'' </p> <p> Increasingly angry at what they consider the lenient treatment that Russia received in its $4.5 billion bailout by the International Monetary Fund, Latin American officials and economists warned today that the programs being offered to protect their own countries were too paltry. </p> <p> Guillermo Ortiz, Mexico's central bank governor and former Finance Minister, said that faced with the mounting financial pressures on Latin America and the rest of the developing world, the $90 billion the United States wants to give the monetary fund in extra lending money would be adequate ''if things go well, but not enough for a bad scenario.'' </p> <p> In an unusually pessimistic report, the International Monetary Fund said today that it now expects the Russian  economy to contract by 6 percent this year and next, and Japan to sink  into its deepest recession since the end of World War II. </p> <p> The report, issued a day before finance ministers from around the world arrive here for annual meetings of the World Bank and the I.M.F., also drastically scales back estimates of how fast other economies will grow. It urges 90 percent of the world's central banks to cut interest rates in an effort to spur growth and calls for greater cuts in the United States. The Federal Reserve announced its first cut in three years -- a modest quarter-percent off one of its key short-term rates. </p> <p> Russia's former tax chief urged the West today not to provide further financial aid unless Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov takes drastic measures to develop a market economy. </p> <p> ''The I.M.F. should learn a lesson from the past five years,'' the former official, Boris G. Fyodorov, said, referring to the International Monetary Fund. ''The I.M.F. was pretending that it was seeing a lot of reforms in Russia. Russia was pretending to conduct reforms. The Western taxpayer was paying for it.'' </p> <p> The House of Unions, like so many buildings in Russia, has served many different masters. In the 18th century, a Crimean prince commissioned its construction in Moscow. Russian nobles later converted it to a private club. Lenin, Stalin and Brezhnev lay in state behind its bright green facade. </p> <p> And in June, as Russia lurched toward a financial crisis that set off global shock waves, the House of Unions was rented for a glittering celebration of capitalism, with one of the country's most ardent bankers, Goldman, Sachs & Company, as its host. Goldman flew in former President George Bush, paying him more than $100,000, and entertained Russia's former Prime Minister. But between toasts to United States-Russian ties, the talk was about what really mattered to Goldman and many Wall Street brethren: deals. </p> <p> Slender birch trees, their leaves turning gold and orange in the early autumn air, line roads leading to this humble, fraying town about 50 miles southeast of Moscow. </p> <p> But closer to Voskresensk, the fresh country air turns acrid with the noxious odor of fumes belched from smokestacks atop one of Russia's largest fertilizer plants. </p> <p> As the global economic crisis spreads, the World Bank fears that it will be made to transform itself from a slow-moving development agency into a financial fire truck, programmed to squirt streams of cash at countries under speculative attack as part of a plan to head off such crises. </p> <p> Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund, which was expressly created to perform the job of emergency financial rescue, is in danger of becoming sidelined in the present emergency. After advancing huge loans to Asia and Russia, it has only enough cash left for one more big rescue operation unless the United States Congress overcomes its hostility to giving it new funds. </p> <p> If the Commu nist Party has its way  and it has been planning for months -- millions of Russians will take to the streets on Wednesday for some of the biggest demonstrations in years. </p> <p> But now that Communists or politicians with the Communist stamp of approval are running the country and its economy, the question is what the marchers will be demonstrating against. </p> <p> Yevgeny Primakov, Russia's new Prime Minister, would seem to have little choice but to pony up back wages owed to millions of Russian workers, some of whom haven't been paid in more than two years. But Mr. Primakov's solution -- printing a mass of new rubles -- has an air of unreality about it. </p> <p> Money can be printed, but how much of it will reach the unpaid? Rubles transferred by Moscow to the country's 89 regions continue to disappear without a trace, as local officials siphon them off for themselves. Russia has an inordinate number of state functionaries but no functioning state. This paralyzing circumstance constitutes the essence of the political crisis. </p> <p> With his long hair and dark blue beret, Vladimir Tyuterev, 31, didn't look like most of the other demonstrators at today's mass protest in Moscow. </p> <p> He was not waving a red flag like the Communists. He was not dressed in black like the members of nationalist youth groups. He did not carry a placard calling for President Boris N. Yeltsin's resignation. </p> <p> Red banners flapping in the breeze, Communists and trade unionists led a nationwide strike today to protest President Boris N. Yeltsin's rule. </p> <p> In Moscow, thousands of protesters marched toward the Kremlin during a brilliantly sunny day to demand that Mr. Yeltsin resign. In Vladivostok, the improverished port city on Russia's Pacific Coast, strikers briefly blocked a road. </p> <p> Members of Congress expressed doubts today about Russia's continued role in the international space station as NASA officials defended plans to help Russia finish important components of the program and reduce future dependence on the cash-strapped nation in completing the orbiting outpost. </p> <p> Daniel S. Goldin, Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said that plans to pay Russia $660 million over four years for equipment and services connected with the space station were necessary to save the multinational project and that more money would be needed to pay other added costs, most of them caused by Russia's financial problems. </p> <p> Russia's new Prime Minister picked an unusual way to reassure the nation today. After two weeks of deliberations he announced that he still had no plan to rescue the country from its economic crisis. </p> <p> ''I want to repeat once more -- there is no program,'' the Prime Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, said. ''It has yet to be worked out.'' </p> <p> When Russia went into a tailspin earlier this year, Poland's stock market crashed. Investors pulled $1 billion in short-term capital out of the country and prepared for Poland to descend into the maelstrom. </p> <p> Yet the panic that threatened to upset Eastern Europe's largest economy, and most notable success story, appears at the moment to have receded. Russia remains in distress, but Poland is moving forward. </p> <p> European stock markets, notably Germany's, plunged today, as investors across the Continent seemed to conclude that they are no longer insulated from crises elsewhere. </p> <p> Banks and other financial institutions were among the biggest losers, battered by fears of more losses related to Asia, Russia and Latin America as well as by the shock waves from the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the American hedge fund. </p> <p> When the world's finance ministers and central bankers gathered last year in Hong Kong, they nervously congratulated each other for containing -- at least for the moment -- a nasty financial brush fire in Asia. In a year's time, many predicted in hallway chatter, the troubles in Thailand and Indonesia would look like a replay of Mexico in 1995 -- a rough bump in the road for a world enjoying remarkable prosperity. </p> <p> Talk about bad market calls. Twelve months later, as the same financial mandarins clog Washington with their limousines and glide through endless receptions at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, just about everything that could have gone wrong in the world economy has: the worst downturn in Japan since World War II, economic meltdown in Russia, a depression in Indonesia that is plunging 100 million people below the poverty line, and deep fears over what happens next in Latin America. </p> <p> The global financial turmoil has jolted big banks across Europe and the United States, but few can match the woes here in Switzerland. </p> <p> First came the agreement this summer by the biggest Swiss banks, led by Credit Suisse Group and UBS A.G., to pay $1.25 billion to settle a suit brought by Holocaust survivors concerning plundered wealth that had been stored in Swiss banks. </p> <p> Now that Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov has spent six weeks leading one of the biggest nations in the world through its worst fiscal crisis, one thing is becoming increasingly clear: nobody outside the Kremlin knows what the Prime Minister is doing. </p> <p> Whether this is by design or accident, or good or bad, is open to dispute. But it is indisputably making economists, financiers and politicians nervous. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin abruptly cut short a three-day visit to Central Asia today after the his doctor announced that Mr. Yeltsin was suffering from bronchitis and a slight fever. </p> <p> But the Kremlin's record of covering up the President's health problems left many commentators questioning whether Mr. Yeltsin's illness was more serious. It also compounded the sense that the nation lacked a fully functioning leader during one of its gravest crises. </p> <p> To the Russians crazy enough to live there, summer in the Siberian Arctic is merely a deep breath before the next winter, a few weeks of melted ice and midnight sun in which to gird for the next deep freeze. </p> <p> Either they use those weeks to haul in enough food and fuel to make it to the next thaw or they shiver and starve through the coming months of darkness. </p> <p> Russia vowed today to veto any attempt by the United Nations to authorize air strikes against Yugoslavia and warned of ''serious international consequences'' if NATO proceeds with force to halt the ethnic conflict in Kosovo Province. </p> <p> Russia's stepped-up effort to insert itself into the diplomatic wrangling over Kosovo comes as Russian officials in Washington and elsewhere are pressing the West to rescue their foundering economy. </p> <p> Russia's Prime Minister made an extraordinary appeal for calm tonight as millions of Communists and trade unionists prepared nationwide strikes over the ravaged economy. </p> <p> ''The way out of the crisis for Russia is in public order and consent, stability and discipline,'' the Prime Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, said in a televised address. ''I would to like call on everybody not to rock our common boat in today's stormy seas.'' </p> <p> As President Clinton argued anew today that ''we must find a way to temper the volatile swings of the international marketplace,'' the president of the World Bank publicly broke with the approach that the United States and the International Monetary Fund have taken in managing the global crisis. </p> <p> In a speech to the finance ministers and central bank governors from 182 nations meeting here, James D. Wolfensohn, the World Bank president, said that in the rush to stabilize currencies and bring about economic reform, too little attention was being paid to the growing ranks of unemployed and the risks of undercutting political stability. ''The poor cannot wait on our deliberations,'' he said. </p> <p> Rocked by its worst harvest in 45 years and a plummeting ruble, Russia appealed today for relief aid from the European Union. It has also approached the United States and Canada for help. </p> <p> Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov broached the question of relief at a meeting today with Jacques Santer, the President of the European Union. ''There has been a request for humanitarian aid,'' a spokeswoman for Mr. Santer said. ''There are no details yet.'' </p> <p> The United States is disappointed by the economic confusion within the new Russian Government of Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said today, and she warned Russia about the dangers of an anti-Western policy. </p> <p> In her first comprehensive review of United States-Russian relations since Mr. Primakov was confirmed as Prime Minister last month, Ms. Albright said Washington was ''deeply concerned'' about Russia's direction and did not think the crisis there would soon abate. </p> <p> Fanning widespread fears that Brazil is plunging into a full-fledged recession, the Government announced today that the economy contracted by 1.5 percent in the third quarter from the second quarter and said that key indicators pointed toward an even more pronounced slump over the next few months. </p> <p> The decline in the gross domestic product, sharper than expected, was the worst in three years for Brazil. The nation's economy, the eighth largest in the world, grew 1.4 percent in the second quarter of 1998 over the preceding three months, and most analysts had been predicting further advances until the collapse of the Russian economy in August set off a stampede of investors from many emerging markets. </p> <p> Thousands of mourners waited hours in the bitter cold today to pay an emotional and politically charged farewell to a liberal legislator whose killing on Friday has turned into a call to arms for Russia's frayed democratic forces. </p> <p> Inside the ornate Marble Hall at the Museum of Ethnography, where the lawmaker, Galina V. Starovoitova, lay in state, her grim-faced friends and allies issued a challenge to those who, many believe, ordered a brazen political assassination. </p> <p> Seven weeks after it took office in the midst of a deepening financial crisis, the Russian Government today approved the first draft of a recovery plan that calls for more public spending and tighter Government control of the economy. </p> <p> The preliminary document, which has yet to be officially disclosed, has already been dismissed by a visiting team from the International monetary Fund, which said in a statement last night that the Government has not tackled several important issues, including a ''realistic budget'' for 1999. </p> <p> Russia has told Western bankers that it will renege on the terms of repaying $28 billion in Soviet-era debt to creditors, effectively paving the way for a default on interest payments next month, bankers said here today. </p> <p> The Russian position emerged from three days of negotiations this week between Russian officials and the so-called London Club, a loose assembly of more than 600 Western creditors. It is the latest setback for Russia, which has already announced its intention to renegotiate foreign loans. The country is facing a collapsing currency, a yawning budget deficit and a deteriorating economy. </p> <p> Here, along Russia's southern border, where refugees from a crumbling empire have settled in the ruins of the local economy, it does not take much to disturb the festering sores of Russian nationalism. </p> <p> All it takes is an enemy. </p> <p> Ten years ago, when economic reform began its uneven march through Russia's industrial heartland, the most visible landmark in this steel town was a deadly multicolored plume that hung over the vast Magnitogorsk Metal Works. </p> <p> Now, on a misty autumn morning, the sky is still, a welcome breath of fresh air for the scarred lungs of the 430,000 people who live here on the banks of the Ural River. </p> <p> Later this week, President Clinton heads for the annual meeting of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which this year, by quirky fate, is being held in Malaysia, a country that has denounced the West, rejected the International Monetary Fund's approach to the Asian crisis and tried to stop all trading in its currency. While in Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Clinton will also be seeing the President of China and the new Prime Minister of Russia. </p> <p> In this century, this city has made more than its share of history and seen more than its share of blood. It was here in 1917 that the Romanov dynasty fell and the Bolshevik revolution began. The murder here in 1934 of a local Communist commissar unleashed Stalin's campaign of terror, which sent millions to camps in Siberia and to their deaths. </p> <p> And so for many Russians, there was an eerie echo to the shots fired in a stairwell off the ice-bound Griboyedova Canal, killing Galina Starovoitova, a 52-year-old Russian legislator known for her fierce defense of democracy and her down-to-earth common sense. </p> <p> The Russian Government said today for the first time that it will not pay its foreign debts next year, and will seek to renegotiate the loans. </p> <p> Today's announcement is just the latest in a litany of familiar setbacks here that includes a collapsing currency, a yawning budget deficit and a deteriorating economy. </p> <p> The recent drop in the price of oil and natural gas and the continuing decline of other commodity prices at year's end is putting renewed pressure on many of the emerging-market countries at the center of the global financial crisis. </p> <p> Many of the world's most troubled nations -- economically, politically, or both -- depend on the sale of commodities for a major part of their economic growth and government revenue. </p> <p> After three months of vacillation, the Government today finally unveiled its 1999 spending plan to halt Russia's economic tumble. </p> <p> Yevgeny M. Primakov called the economic blueprint, his first as Prime Minister, a bold effort to boost Russian hard-pressed factories and farms while clamping down on wasteful spending. </p> <p> Russia failed to make a $362 million payment today on Soviet-era debt that it owes to commercial banks around the world, a move that American officials, the International Monetary Fund and lenders to Russia fear could signal a growing movement in Moscow to simply default on the country's obligations. </p> <p> The lenders, led by the Bank of America,  stopped short of calling today's action a default, even though it appeared to be exactly that. In August, in the midst of the devaluation of the ruble and the dismissal of the economic reformers who had negotiated a bailout of the country with the International Monetary Fund, Russia failed to pay hundreds of millions of dollars it owed to foreign governments. But today's action was the first in which it failed to pay private creditors, on whom the country's chances of economic recovery hinge. </p> <p> The planet's most daring construction job began today as the shuttle Endeavour carried into orbit six astronauts and the first American-built part of an international space station that is expected to cost more than $100 billion. </p> <p> After a last-minute alarm on the shuttle forced a postponement early Thursday, the launching went off flawlessly at 3:36 this morning, right on schedule. The night sky was clear, and the moon full. With a roar, Endeavour made its fiery ascent and briefly turned the Florida coastline from night to day. More than five minutes and 500 miles later, the spaceship's main engines could still be seen in the distance, twinkling like a new star. </p> <p> Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov approved a plan today to restructure nearly $14 billion in defaulted Russian Treasury bonds, but the move quickly drew criticism from foreign creditors, who complained that they had not been consulted about the details and that Russia was forcing a bad deal upon them. </p> <p> The negotiations over Russian Treasury debt have been overshadowed in recent months by President Boris N. Yeltsin's ill health, food shortages and long delays in paying back wages. The debt talks, however, are significant. At stake is Russia's credibility with foreign lenders and its long-term access to the financial markets. </p> <p> Responding cautiously to warnings about the potential for widespread computer disasters in 2000, the first global convention of government representatives to deal with the so-called Millennium bug ended today with an informal endorsement of regional cooperation. </p> <p> The concluding summary, issued by Ahmad Kamal of Pakistan, the head of the United Nations task force on information technology, also encouraged Mr. Kamal and the other organizers to develop an organization to coordinate the sharing of information and contingency plans. </p> <p> THAT would Freud have made of the way George Soros, the world's most famous hedge fund manager, describes the tension brought on by having made a fortune as a speculator and then having reinvented himself as a globe-trotting philanthropist? </p> <p> ''Sometimes I felt like a gigantic digestive tract, taking in money at one end and pushing it out at the other,'' Mr. Soros writes earthily in the preface to his new book, ''The Crisis of Global Capitalism'' (Public Affairs, $26). ''But in fact a considerable amount of thought connected the two ends.'' </p> <p> When economic crisis struck in Moscow in August, choking off the banks, wiping out savings and sending the ruble on a new downward spiral, few in Kostroma even noticed at first. </p> <p> Out here, a four-hour drive northeast of Moscow, people hadn't gambled fortunes on lucrative Government bonds or stashed sacks of dollars in the banks or developed a taste for imported goods. There really wasn't much money around -- dollars or rubles -- and hadn't been for a long time. So life mostly went on. ''We don't live, we exist,'' they'll tell you here. Eventually prices rose, but so did the hope that next time some of the money might reach the provinces. </p> <p> For four long years, President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko has pursued an unlikely obsession: to raise tiny Belarus from the shards of the sundered Soviet Union and remake it into a model socialist state. </p> <p> Lately, it seems he has succeeded all too well. </p> <p> As most of its neighbors suffer through their worst financial crises of modern times, China stands almost alone. It has held its currency steady, kept its economy primed and continued its long-running economic reforms. </p> <p> Now, it will collect its reward. </p> <p> The Presidents of Russia and Belarus said today that they intended to begin unifying their currencies and much of their economies next year, an action that would stop just short of a political merger that would again extend Russian territory to the border of Poland. </p> <p> Whether such a military or political union could occur later was left unclear. President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus, a fervent proponent of merging his nation into Russia, said he hoped that the two countries would enter the millennium as one. </p> <p> It is lunch time in the children's quarters at the women's prison colony here, and 10 little pale faces are bent over bowls of grey mush, a blend of watery potatoes with a dash of meat. The meal is not a big hit with the scruffy 2-year-olds, but for the women who are trying to coax spoonfuls into their mouths, the fact that there is anything on the table at all is a small victory. </p> <p> By their calculations, the Russian Government has practically stopped paying a daily food allowance for the 64 children, all under age 3, who live in the fenced compound where their mothers are serving sentences for crimes ranging from theft to murder. </p> <p> It was near midnight seven years ago when a vast crowd gathered outside K.G.B. headquarters here as four cranes hoisted from its pedestal a statue of a hated man: Feliks Dzerzhinsky, founder of the secret police that helped keep the Soviet Union in fear for 74 years. </p> <p> Last month, Russia's Parliament voted to put the statue back. </p> <p> Markets and governments around the world operated under an unshakable assumption throughout the economic turmoil last year: if things really got bad, the United States would be there to engineer a bailout. </p> <p> After all, as everyone from President Clinton to Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin kept declaring, the future of the United States was inextricably linked to the fate of the troubled emerging economies. </p> <p> The fall in value of the Russian ruble last August was responsible in part for toppling Prime Minister Sergei V. Kiriyenko and his reformist Cabinet, wrecking Russia's banking system and inflicting considerable damage to commerce. Traders ran into roadblocks in buying foreign goods on credit, consumers scrambled to pay inflated prices for items that quickly became scarce. And banks, including Bankers Trust, J.P. Morgan and Citigroup, reported ruble-related losses. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin left his sickbed to deliver a surprisingly bullish year-end verdict on Russia's economy. ''Russia is on the up,'' he declared. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin, in fact, is probably the only optimist. From international economists to the Kremlin's own specialists, the prognosis is decidedly grim. </p> <p> The chief question is not whether Russia will turn the corner this year. It is whether Russia will find some way to muddle through despite a weakening economy or whether the situation will tumble precipitously out of control. </p> <p> This time investors were better prepared to absorb the shock. </p> <p> In contrast to the aftermath of Russia's collapse in August, the initial flight to safety that followed the Brazilian currency devaluation yesterday did not turn to panic in American stock and bond markets. Big bettors learned their lesson: Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. </p> <p> AS Yogi Berra once observed, it's deja vu all over again. </p> <p> Brazil, which yesterday devalued its currency, the real, and announced the resignation of its central bank president, Gustavo Franco, is the latest victim of the global financial contagion that first broke out in Southeast Asia about 18 months ago. </p> <p> When President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin announced two months ago what they termed a ''precautionary'' $41.5 billion aid package for Brazil, they described it as the first test of a new strategy to help countries reform their economies before being overwhelmed by the tumultuous global market forces that have swept from Asia to Russia to Latin America. </p> <p> In return, the Brazilians said they would curb free-spending ways -- they signed an accord declaring that their Government was ''fully committed'' to maintaining the system for managing the value of its currency. Only by slowly decreasing the value of the real, the thinking went, could Brazil keep itself and the rest of Latin America from descending into a nasty recession. </p> <p> The International Monetary Fund, sharply criticized for how it handled crises from Southeast Asia to Russia, is discussing an overhaul of its operations that could let it intervene directly in national economies long before they get into deep trouble. </p> <p> The ideas being discussed in the fund -- and by outsiders like George Soros, the billionaire -- build upon and go substantially beyond proposals made by President Clinton and leaders of other industrial powers in October. </p> <p> Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright embarks Sunday on a trip to a weakened but obstinate Russia, with little expectation on either side that much will improve in a relationship plagued by disagreement on everything from Russia's economic collapse to air strikes against Iraq. </p> <p> In contrast to the euphoria of the heady days when Russia was envisioned as a full member of a ''Group of Eight'' industrialized democracies, the hope today is to keep a dialogue alive, an Administration official said. </p> <p> Some days Avilio Guia likes to come and sit outside the new Carlos III Market and watch the people coming and going from dollar-only shops. </p> <p> He was a foreman on the construction team that built the mall a year ago. Now, it is a world out of his reach. His Government salary is only 600 pesos a month, less than $30. He has no way to earn hard currency and the shops inside accept nothing else. </p> <p> Here in Russia's most northern city, a winter's day is two hours of cheerless gray. The temperature plunges to 40 below. And delays in getting wages are measured in years, not months. </p> <p> It is the edge of the world and the end of the line for thousands of Russians drawn here during Soviet times by promises of high pay and patriotic appeals. </p> <p> What's the difference between being rich and being poor? asks a joke currently making the rounds on Wall Street. Answer: About 30 seconds. </p> <p> These days, huge sums of money are made and lost on Wall Street at unforgiving speeds. Lately, mostly lost. Indeed, many of the financial service industry's biggest players, battered by global economic turmoil and rapid-fire market shifts, have reported dismal earnings for 1998. </p> <p> Russia's gross domestic product fell 4.6 percent in 1998, the sharpest drop in four years, the State Statistics Committee reported today. There were declines in industry, construction and farming. </p> <p> Before the financial crisis, Russia's economy appeared to be leveling off, and the Government had hoped it would turn around last year. </p> <p> They were serious men, prosperous and pinstriped, and they derided ''the politics of class warfare'' as they conducted a job interview with the young Governor from Arkansas. </p> <p> It was steak dinner in a private room of the ''21'' Club in June 1991, and the top Democratic executives on Wall Street were gathered at a round table to hold one of a series of meetings with Presidential aspirants in what an organizer called ''an elegant cattle show.'' They were questioning a man with a meager salary but a silver tongue, and this was another show in which Gov. Bill Clinton charmed his way to a blue ribbon by impressing the executives with his willingness to embrace free trade and free markets. </p> <p> Mary Jo Paoni stood contentedly in her front yard, as firmly planted in Middle America as any of the cornstalks out back. </p> <p> ''I wouldn't invest in Asia,'' she said, shaking her head decisively. A 59-year-old secretary with big, sparkling eyes, a plaid shirt and no pretensions, she added, ''Investing in Asia frightens me.'' </p> <p> Pigs to the left, pigs to the right, pigs all around him, Charles E. Burrus stood in the cacophonous center of his barn, gesturing at the indignant squealers. He felt like squealing, too. </p> <p> ''I don't know what we're going to do in the next three months,'' said Mr. Burrus, oblivious to the stench of the 7,000 animals around him. ''We're losing $10,000 to $15,000 a semi load.'' </p> <p> Kosovo's ethnic Albanians took the pressure off President Slobodan  Milosevic by failing to agree to terms at talks outside Paris, Serbian officials and analysts said today, allowing Mr. Milosevic to create at least temporary divisions within the West. </p> <p> Mr. Milosevic remains prepared to make a deal, these officials and analysts said, but he will want, in return, to ease his country's economic and diplomatic isolation. </p> <p> In Red Square, just across from the mausoleum where Lenin lies in state like some old biological curiosity preserved in formaldehyde, there is a grand three-story stone building that these days is in about the same shape. </p> <p> The rococo facade of the GUM department store resembles that of a cathedral, but its gaudy interior is an emporium with mink coats on hangers and on customers. GUM seemed a symbol of Russia's hope, for the spiffily dressed chairman of the board, Yuri B. Solomatin, 44, came across as a Russian capitalist with a difference. </p> <p> Russia's central bank is engulfed in a political firestorm over its decision to use an offshore company to manage some of its cash reserves. </p> <p> It is not clear how much of the bank's reserves were kept overseas or who may have earned fees and commissions from managing the money. </p> <p> Boris A. Berezovsky has always been the most brazen, the most quoted and the most visible of Russia's new tycoons -- all reasons why he also seemed to be the most influential. </p> <p> Today, the math whiz-auto dealer-financier extraordinaire -- reportedly one of the richest, and certainly one of the most reviled men in Russia -- also became the most overheard. </p> <p> The citizens of this graceful but impoverished city have a message for the West: Hand over your money, or we'll shoot. </p> <p> Just a decade ago, when Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union, Lviv was a prime supplier of Moscow's tanks, bombsights and military electronics. When the Soviet Union vanished, so did Lviv's weapons orders, scores of thousands of factory jobs -- and then, bit by bit, the city's hope for a capitalist future. </p> <p> The International Monetary Fund said today that it had agreed on ''a broad framework'' to resume financial aid to Russia, but American officials immediately warned that they would permit only enough support to keep  Moscow from defaulting on international loans. </p> <p> The vague accord, the first since Russia's economic meltdown last summer, followed a hastily arranged meeting in Moscow between Michel Camdessus, managing director of the fund, and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov of Russia. But only hours after Mr. Primakov's aides suggested that the I.M.F. would lend Russia more than $8 billion this year, the fund denied that Mr. Camdessus had discussed specific amounts. </p> <p> The unity of a key group of Western banks holding $15 billion in defaulted, short-term Russian treasury debt frayed tonight after two of its members, including the leader, broke ranks to accept a vaguely defined Russian repayment package of rubles and new bonds regarded as nearly worthless. </p> <p> Both Deutsche Bank, which heads the group, and Chase Manhattan agreed to the Russian terms, said to be worth about 5 cents on the dollar, or one-twentieth of the face value of the investments. </p> <p> Russia vowed tonight to punish the separatist Chechnya region unless Chechen kidnappers quickly released a high-ranking Russian officer. The threat  represented the most serious deterioration in Russian-Chechen relations since a peace settlement was concluded more than two years ago. </p> <p> Russian officials declined to specify how they would respond to the kidnapping of Maj. Gen. Gennadi Shpigun, a senior Interior Ministry official. Sergei Stepashin, the Interior Minister, said tonight that Russia was planning a series of economic, political and ''operational'' measures. The aim was not just to free the kidnapped officer but also to punish the Chechens, said Mr. Stepashin, who was a hawk during the fierce  Chechen war. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin has delivered a stern warning to Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov, accusing him of being ''complacent'' about the  nation's economic course and threatening yet another Government shake-up. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin's unusual public riposte was expressed through a senior aide, Oleg N. Sysuyev, the Deputy Chief of Staff. </p> <p> Serbia's latest offensive in Kosovo is leading some of Russia's top foreign policy specialists to question Moscow's longstanding support for Belgrade. </p> <p> With Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov set to leave on Tuesday for Washington, Russia's top priority is to wrest billions of dollars from the International Monetary Fund, not argue over the Balkans. </p> <p> Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov promised a group of American Jews today that the Russian Government will combat a rising tide of anti-Semitism. </p> <p> Mr. Primakov provided the assurance in a meeting with representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a division of B'nai B'rith. The Kremlin has condemned anti-Semitism, but Mr. Primakov has previously said little about the problem, although he himself has Jewish family roots. </p> <p> A group of 19 Western banks holding $15 billion in defaulted short-term Russian Government debt headed for deeper division today after the largest creditor, Credit Suisse First Boston, broke the group's already fractured ranks to announce a new ruble-based investment fund aimed at recovering the bad debt. </p> <p> The proposal by Credit Suisse First Boston represented the second time in recent weeks that the lender banks had been divided over the best way to recover at least some of a debt that no one expects to be repaid in full. </p> <p> In his long and somewhat mysterious political career, Yevgeny M. Primakov has dealt with the United States in many guises: reform Communist, intelligence chief and an occasionally quarrelsome Foreign Minister. </p> <p> But now, as Prime Minister and effective leader of the Russian Government under an erratic, ailing and jealous President Boris N. Yeltsin, Mr. Primakov is facing one of his most important challenges. </p> <p> The Treasury Secretary, Robert E. Rubin, told a Congressional panel today that he suspected that much of the $4.8 billion in loans sent to Russia last summer by the International Monetary Fund ''may have been siphoned off improperly.'' </p> <p> It was the Clinton Administration's first public statement supporting accusations that bailout money simply helped wealthy Russian oligarchs move billions of dollars to Switzerland and other safe havens. </p> <p> When the Russian Prime Minister, Yevgeny Primakov, visits Washington next week, he and President Clinton will have to confront this incongruity: The International Monetary Fund needs to renew lending to Russia not so Russia can finally reform itself, but mainly so that it can repay the I.M.F. It's an absurd situation, but international finance is like that. </p> <p> The I.M.F. suspended its loans to Russia last year after Russia's devaluation and partial default, and after a long record of false promises and failed reforms. Now the I.M.F. is deciding whether to release the rest of the $22.6 billion in loans. Without the money, there is no chance whatsoever that Russia will be able to repay the approximately $4.8 billion it owes this year to the fund and the World Bank. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin told Russian political leaders today that the country ''will not allow itself to be drawn into military conflict'' in Yugoslavia. </p> <p> The President's words came at the start of his annual speech to lawmakers and Cabinet members on the state of the nation. He presented Russia as a country at a critical and historic juncture, in danger of being relegated to a second rank of nations if it failed to overcome its political divisions and economic weaknesses. </p> <p> Like many of Russia's Jews, Anatoly Vugman would like to stay in Russia. But since the financial crisis hit last August, the 20-year-old student has begun to hedge his bets by attending evening Hebrew classes. </p> <p> Mr. Vugman has plenty of company. With the economy distressed and political extremists making anti-Semitic tirades, enrollment in Hebrew classes here has tripled in the last year. </p> <p> After months of decline, the Russian economy is beginning to show some stability, according to a monthly report issued today by an independent research organization and the Government. </p> <p> The April issue of the report, ''Russian Economic Trends,'' noted small increases in consumer spending and industrial production in February and a falling inflation rate last month. </p> <p> The International Monetary Fund and the Russian Government will begin a critical round of negotiations later today that is aimed at completing an economic program and loan package to avert a threatened default on Russia's foreign debt. </p> <p> Its Treasury and central bank reserves vastly depleted by the financial crisis that began last August, Russia hopes to get the fund to refinance about $4.8 billion in loans coming due this year, most of that in the second and third quarters. </p> <p> Ignoring the protests of several international banks, Russia held foreign investors to a deadline of today for agreeing to a plan that restructures $40 billion in defaulted Government debt at a fraction of its face value. </p> <p> Represented by 19 major lenders such as Credit Suisse First Boston, Deutsche Bank and Chase Manhattan, foreign investors hold about $17 billion of that debt, which is in ruble-denominated Russian Treasury bills. </p> <p> The International Monetary Fund announced a preliminary agreement tonight to lend Russia $4.5 billion over the next 18 months, the first resumption of loans since the country defaulted on its debts and devalued its currency last summer. </p> <p> But in a highly unusual element of the deal that was not mentioned in tonight's announcement, the money will never actually be sent to Moscow. Instead, at the insistence of the United States Treasury and some European nations, the loans will essentially be transferred from one of the I.M.F.'s accounts to another -- allowing Russia to avoid default on money it owes the lending agency this year and next. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin's decision to dismiss his Cabinet may deepen Russia's economic troubles by jeopardizing a badly needed loan-refinancing program from the International Monetary Fund and negotiations with other foreign creditors. </p> <p> This year, Russia was supposed to repay the I.M.F. about $4 billion and sovereign lenders and commercial banks about $17 billion. But after the economy collapsed last summer, Russia effectively defaulted on much of its foreign debt. Consequently, the Cabinet of the now-ousted Prime Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, and the I.M.F. had spent the last few months developing an economic program and tied it to a critical refinancing agreement, announced in Washington late last month. The I.M.F. deal, in turn, gave Russia the credibility to renegotiate its debts with other creditors. </p> <p> Finance Minister Mikhail M. Zadornov, an advocate of tough fiscal policies, will take charge of Russia's economic policy, Prime Minister Sergei V. Stepashin said today. </p> <p> Mr. Zadornov's promotion to the rank of First Deputy Prime Minister was one of the few surprises in a series of Cabinet appointments announced today by Mr. Stepashin, Russia's new Prime Minister, as he returned to Moscow after meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin at the Black Sea resort of Sochi. </p> <p> Russia's Acting Prime Minister told Parliament today that he would demand a vote of confidence in his new Government if the lawmakers refused to enact economic reforms on which Western lenders have conditioned billions of dollars in new loans. </p> <p> Sergei V. Stepashin, President Boris N. Yeltsin's choice for Prime Minister, issued the pledge as he met with major parties in the Communist-led lower house of Parliament, which will vote on Wednesday on his nomination. </p> <p> Ever the gambler, President Boris N. Yeltsin abruptly fired Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov today, pushing Russia to the brink of a new political crisis. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin's latest Government shake-up, his third in 15 months, comes as the Russian Parliament opens what promises to be a stormy debate on his impeachment on Thursday, with the outcome of the vote, scheduled for Saturday, increasingly uncertain. </p> <p> Encircled by leftist opponents and reduced almost to a cipher in opinion polls, clearly ill and on the brink of impeachment, Boris N. Yeltsin rose today to dismiss a Government he had never embraced and to try once again to position himself as Russia's savior. </p> <p> But after eight years of such dramatic dismissals, the question this time was: Who is Mr. Yeltsin trying to save, democratic Russia, or himself? </p> <p> Another spring, this one cold and raw, finds Aleksandra Varfolomeyeva in her one-story wooden house on the road halfway between Pskov and St. Petersburg. She lives here with her husband, her 40-year-old son, six sheep, two cows, two calves, a horse, a piglet and a dog named Fog. </p> <p> Mrs. Varfolomeyeva, a vivacious 75-year-old with a gap-toothed smile beneath a bright purple kerchief, spent her working life on the local collective farm, for which she receives a Government pension of 400 rubles a month. Last year, 400 rubles were worth $66. Today, that same sum is worth $16 -- that is, when it is actually delivered to her door, in cash, by the postman. </p> <p> Fresh from concluding a vital debt refinancing agreement with the International Monetary Fund, top Russian ministers said today that foreign creditors were close to agreeing on deferred repayment of the country's Soviet-era loans. </p> <p> At the same time, the officials played down the political disputes that the I.M.F. agreement could cause within the Russian Parliament and the Government. The I.M.F.'s terms commit the Russians to making painful economic changes. </p> <p> Caterpillar had just cleared away a patch of spindly trees in this town outside St. Petersburg and begun building a new $50 million factory when, one day last August, the Russian financial system collapsed. </p> <p> Overnight, the Russian Government devalued its currency and simultaneously defaulted on $40 billion in domestic debt. Prices rose by two-thirds over the next seven months, and the spending power of ordinary Russians decreased 40 percent. The ruble, worth around 15 cents before the crisis, has fallen to about 4 cents. Many smaller companies, such as those Caterpillar had envisioned as customers for its Russian-made construction equipment, were ruined. </p> <p> About two years ago, Matt Hazard and three of his buddies got together to form a new, hard-rock band in Minneapolis. At a loss for what to call themselves, they settled on Moral Hazard. </p> <p> ''The guitarist wanted to get my last name in the band because we thought it sounded cool, but every combination seemed kind of lame,'' recalls the 19-year-old Mr. Hazard. ''But we were all in the same high school economics class, and one day our teacher began writing that term on the board and we said, 'That's it.' '' </p> <p> The Parliament is priming itself for a vote to impeach the President on charges that he brought Russia to ruin. The President's men talk darkly of dumping the Prime Minister, accusing him of leading the country back to its Communist past. </p> <p> Welcome to Russia's latest political crisis, where rumors are rife and political intriguers have already unsheathed their knives for a showdown Saturday, when the impeachment of President Boris N. Yeltsin is due to come to a vote. </p> <p> Against the backdrop of Russia's political turmoil, the economy seems to be gradually reviving from its collapse last summer, with increased consumer spending and industrial production, a Moscow research group said today in a widely followed monthly report. </p> <p> Consumer expenditures rose 1.5 percent in March from February, the second consecutive month of growth, according to the report, Russian Economic Trends. Industrial production returned to its level in December 1997, the highest since the collapse of the Soviet Union. </p> <p> Reflecting concern that the war in Kosovo is diverting political energy and  scarce resources from other conflicts, Secretary General Kofi Annan appealed today to world leaders to do more next month at the meeting of major industrialized nations to help the developing world. </p> <p> In a letter to the heads of the  Group of Seven industrialized countries and Russia, Mr. Annan pressed for increased development aid and greater debt relief for debt-ridden third-world countries and additional steps to shore up the international financial system, whose stability he said is key to preventing global recession. </p> <p> When Russia defaulted on $40 billion in debt last August, most foreigners who had once been lured by the high interest rates on Russian Government bonds figured they would be lucky to get anything at all out of their investments. </p> <p> By late last week, nearly all of them had agreed to the stringent terms of the Russian Government's debt restructuring plan. The trouble is, no one really knows what they have exactly agreed to and how much, if anything, the Government's plan will give them in the end. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin placed two familiar and reform-minded fiscal experts in top economic posts today. </p> <p> But after a week of brutal infighting among his closest advisers, the question of who really controls his latest Government seemed no clearer than before. </p> <p> On Wednesday, Russia will default on roughly $900 million in interest payments on debt it owes the so-called London Club, a group of major foreign banks and investors that lent money to commercial entities of the former Soviet Union. </p> <p> Reneging on debt may be a grave transgression, but most London Club lenders have shown little rancor or surprise at Russia's failure to pay. </p> <p> Investors in the Russian Far East are used to working with risks: the currency is fragile, deposits disappear when banks close, and companies can be taxed out of existence before they show a profit. </p> <p> But a new threat this week has rattled foreign business groups here: a regional governor announced on Monday that he was using the main successor agency to the K.G.B. to investigate whether a prominent British businessman had illegally obtained shares for foreign clients in Russia's biggest shipping company. </p> <p> A blisteringly hot summer and the reverberations from Russia's economic crisis have taken a devastating toll on the nation's crops, making it likely that Moscow will appeal for American food aid, according to Russian and American officials. </p> <p> Russia had hoped to harvest 70 million tons of grain this year. But Western experts estimate that Russian farms will yield no more than 55 million tons. </p> <p> Cementing the relationship between the Kremlin and big business, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin was installed today as chairman of Russia's biggest company, the natural gas monopoly Gazprom. </p> <p> The move returns the former Prime Minister, who recently served as Moscow's envoy to the Balkans, to the company where he began his career. </p> <p> As old as the forbidden fruit, and as hardy a perennial, corruption is back in. </p> <p> Take Russia. When the Soviet Union first collapsed, the first worry in the West was of a Communist revanche. Then it was mass hunger. Then it was resistance to radical reform. Now, virtually to the exclusion of everything else, it is ''koruptsiya'' -- the image of last week's Communists, yesterday's reformers and over-dressed ''New Russians'' amassing billions through plunder and crony capitalism. </p> <p> Seated around the long table on the first floor of the modest dacha, the young men were relaxed, laughing a lot, talking excitedly, sometimes all together. They barely noticed as, guided by their chairman, I skirted the table and took a seat in a little room off their conference chamber to wait for a break in the proceedings. As I sat there, I marveled at the hilarity and occasional cacophony that fairly shook the wooden walls. </p> <p> It was October 1991; the Soviet Union still existed. Yet next door, this little band of brothers was writing the economic program for an independent Russia. When the chairman joined me and began to describe what they were doing, I could not at first take it in. We were seated in a dacha in a little colony of state dachas some 30 miles from Moscow. The scope of the task contrasted oddly with the participants' youth and high spirits. Something graver seemed called for -- a hushed conference hall with graybeards attended by aides, perhaps. This seemed so . . . light. </p> <p> By early evening, there was already a crush of young professionals, families and couples lined up to eat at Arkady Novikov's newest restaurant. </p> <p> For 130 rubles a plate (slightly over $5), Mr. Novikov was offering an oriental buffet of stir-fried vegetables, topped with a mound of sliced meat. Festooned with colorful banners and other trappings from the East, the restaurant has been a huge hit since it opened near Pushkin Square a month ago. </p> <p> With glittery new steel-and-glass offices, an imposing mansion and a high profile in yacht racing, Peter M. Bond has never quite been shy about his success. </p> <p> Indeed, as head of Valmet (Isle of Man) Ltd., Mr. Bond is now in the top ranks of one of this misty island's biggest industries: setting up offshore corporations that shield clients from taxes and regulation. </p> <p> American foreign policy toward Cuba is really unique among U.S. foreign policies. It isn't just 15 degrees off. It has the distinction of being 360 degrees wrong. </p> <p> That is, the longstanding U.S. boycott and isolation of Cuba is a failed policy if your desire is to punish Cuba's people so they will oust Fidel Castro, and it is a failed policy if your desire is to ease the pain on Cuba's people while they wait for Mr. Castro to pass away. It is a failed policy if you think we should be preparing for a post-Castro Cuba. And it is a failed policy if you think we should be trying to bring down Mr. Castro today. It is a failed policy if you believe in human rights, and it is a failed policy if you believe only in trade. </p> <p> In the last month, Russia has been through what people in other countries would call mayhem. A low-level war broke out on the southern border in Dagestan. Then came money-laundering investigations in the United States and Europe that have implicated high-ranking Kremlin officials. And in a two-week period, five terrorist bombings in Moscow and two other cities have left hundreds dead. </p> <p> But to foreign businesses, especially those that have been in Russia for several years, upheaval seems to be part of the landscape. Despite all these disturbances, foreigners trading and manufacturing in Russia have decided to stay put. Portfolio investors in the Russian stock market have been more skittish, but few have sold their holdings. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration said today that it wants assurances that international financial aid already sent to Russia has not been lost to corruption, but stopped short of calling for a halt in future loans to Moscow from the International Monetary Fund. </p> <p> Seeking to defend the Administration's policy of supporting aid to Russia -- and to defuse an issue that could have political ramifications for Vice President Al Gore -- Treasury Department officials and John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said the Administration wanted to be certain that no money loaned to Russia by the fund had been moved surreptitiously out of the country. They were responding to reports of money laundering in which billions of dollars were sent by Russians through the Bank of New York. </p> <p> Only hours after hearing Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers describe the new conditions Russia must meet to receive continued international aid, the head of the country's central bank said his country was ''being treated like whipping boys'' by Washington and suggested that he would resist intensive audits of Russia's books. </p> <p> The comments by Viktor Gerashchenko, a wily veteran of Russia's shifting political scene who also ran the Soviet Union's central bank, marked the first time that Russia has openly and harshly criticized the extensive new auditing demanded by Washington before lending new money to Moscow through the International Monetary Fund. </p> <p> Congressional Republicans ratcheted up their attack on President Clinton's Russia policy today, expanding the scope of hearings into the Russian banking scandal and Washington's dealings with Moscow. </p> <p> The House International Relations and Senate Foreign Relations committees announced that they would hold separate, wide-ranging hearings later this month about American policy toward Russia. The House Banking Committee said hearings it had previously announced would begin on Sept. 21 to examine allegations of Russian corruption and money-laundering, possibly including the diversion of billions of dollars in international aid. </p> <p> Responding to the scandal over alleged Russian money laundering, the Clinton Administration has offered two basic defenses of its Russia policy: 1) that it has long known about crime and corruption (Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott), and 2) that we must stay engaged with Russia for our national security (Samuel Berger, national security adviser). Both of these statements are true. So what is wrong with this picture? </p> <p> Of course the Administration has been aware of the crime and corruption and has known that this has been much more than mafia-type activity. It has known that ''reform'' was the entrenchment of a kleptocracy in which corrupt officials ally with a very few business magnates to send wealth out of the country. </p> <p> Recent allegations that American and European banks have facilitated money laundering for Russian organized-crime figures underscore how intractable a problem corruption in Russia is and how vulnerable Western institutions are to the lure of servicing the world's most virulent kleptocracy. </p> <p> Russia is hardly the first country to be victimized by a culture of corruption. The plundering of the Philippines under Marcos, the looting of Zaire by Mobutu and Indonesia's crony capitalism during the last years of Suharto stand as parallels. What sets Russia apart is the pervasiveness of politically tolerated corruption in a country of such size and geopolitical significance. </p> <p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reported surprisingly strong earnings yesterday in its first full quarter as a public company, a striking reversal from a year ago when fallout from Russia's economic woes forced the firm to postpone plans for its initial public offering of stock. </p> <p> Goldman, which went public with an offering of $3.7 billion on May 4, said it earned $638 million, or $1.32 a diluted share, in its fiscal third quarter, which ended Aug. 27. The results were essentially even with those Goldman reported for its fiscal second quarter and nearly double the $329 million, or 69 cents a share, that Goldman said it would have reported for the period a year earlier if it had been public then. </p> <p> This morning, the House Banking Committee is scheduled to open hearings on the Clinton Administration's Russia policy. This debate can be useful, indeed helpful, provided it takes into account three important factors. </p> <p> First, we must realize that the United States has a critical interest in Russia's stability and economic success and in its transition over time to a market democracy. Second, we must recognize the obstacles Russia faces in switching to a market economy. And third, we must realistically assess the choices the West faces, given the conditions in Russia and our own interests. </p> <p> The American who brought consumer capitalism to Russia 40 years ago came back for a visit last week -- to the reports of bribery and money laundering, to the Mercedesful of impeccably suited thugs, to the political wars  among the lap-dog newspapers and television networks of too-wealthy tycoons, to the throngs of street urchins and dumpster-miners trampled in the stampede to wealth. </p> <p> All in all, he said, it could have been worse. </p> <p> Russia's shaky foreign-investment reputation weakened further today when a court in St. Petersburg ruled that the 255-year-old Lomonosov porcelain factory be renationalized, annulling a majority stake held by executives of a prominent Wall Street buyout firm and an American-financed investment fund. </p> <p> Alistair Stobie, vice president of the $440 million United States-Russia Investment Fund, said it planned to appeal the ruling that voided the ownership interests of his organization and those of executives in Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company. </p> <p> The most important story out of Russia last week was buried in the business pages: Russia's top stock-market watchdog quit after declaring that Boris Yeltsin's government was simply not interested in enforcing laws to protect shareholders in Russia. </p> <p> Imagine if you picked up the paper and found that Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, had quit, saying that the New York stock exchange and our commercial courts were so corrupt that you were better off going to Las Vegas, and putting your money on red or black, than investing in the market. </p> <p> The World Bank said today that it was launching an investigation ''as a matter of urgency'' into the actions of a former member of Russia's delegation to the international development institution who is suspected of passing insider information to a major Russian bank. </p> <p> The investigation, which is being aided by a Washington law firm, will focus on whether the official, Leonid Grigoriev, was secretly receiving payments from Inkombank, a Moscow bank that has since had its license revoked, in return for information about the World Bank's plans to aid the Russian economy. Mr. Grigoriev, who now directs a Moscow research group financed largely by the World Bank, was placed on ''administrative leave'' today. </p> <p> The Clinton administration is quietly reassessing whether to slow two major loan programs to Moscow as the war in Chechnya accelerates and the two leading candidates for the Republican presidential nomination call for a cutoff of aid to Russia. </p> <p> In public, White House officials have said that they continue to favor modest economic support for the Yeltsin government, and that termination of the aid runs the risk of further destabilizing Russia before two major elections there. Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, reiterated that position on Monday when he told reporters that despite the Russian military offensive in Chechnya, it would not ''make sense for us to affect'' a forthcoming loan from the International Monetary Fund, ''assuming the economic and transparency criteria are met.'' </p> <p> Capped in snow, the Shatili Mountains are fabled for their rugged beauty. These days they are also one of the Caucasus' more anxious borders. </p> <p> To the north is Chechnya, a brutal battleground for the Russian military. On the southern side of the mountain divide is Georgia, a former Soviet republic. </p> <p> The Yeltsin ''family'' and its new K.G.B. front man, Vladimir Putin, came up with a plan to regain popularity in the coming elections: Use foreign funds to build up the army and -- under the pretext of anti-terrorism -- exterminate the militant Chechens. </p> <p> So far, it's working. The Russian generals, humiliated by the independence forces five years ago, are using new tactics that inflict civilian casualties with missiles and artillery. Controlled media show victories, not 200,000 pitiful Chechen refugees or Russian body bags. The Yeltsin-Putin party's popularity is soaring. </p> <p> Buoyed by high world oil prices and a boost from a currency devaluation last year, the Russian economy is looking better than it has in years. </p> <p> Gross domestic product is up by almost 2 percent over last year. Tax revenues are well above target, and better yet, they are being collected in cash. Government pensions are now paid up in full. The trade surplus for this year is up almost 30 percent over last year, thanks mostly to a decline in imports. </p> <p> Irina Venyaminova, who runs a family-owned leather workshop in the center of this southern Russia city, has no great desire to vote on Dec. 19, when Russia elects a new Parliament. </p> <p> Neither does Andrei Myakinnikov, who like Irina started his own company in the early 1990's, just as the dust was settling from the collapse of the old Soviet state economy. </p> <p> The United States will not seek to block economic aid to Russia as punishment for that country's widely condemned campaign against separatist rebels in Chechnya, a Clinton administration official said today. </p> <p> The official, speaking after Russia won the release today of a $100 million loan from the World Bank, said  aid packages to Russia from the United States, the World Bank or its sister agency, the International Monetary Fund, would be considered on a case-by-case basis. But he said the Clinton administration would not apply a umbrella political standard when reviewing aid programs and has no plans to cut off aid in general as a way of punishing Russia for its military campaign in Chechnya. </p> <p> After weathering a year of debt defaults, a currency crash, an absentee president and governments that change with the seasons, Russians have one piece of good news: The economy has not collapsed. </p> <p> In the months after the August 1998 crash of the stock market and the ruble, and the appointment of a Government heavy with ardent Communists, many analysts feared a return to fixed prices, shortages of consumer goods and a ceaseless printing of rubles that would have once more ignited hyperinflation. ''It was all lined up for catastrophe, and it just didn't happen,'' said James Fenkner, equities strategist for the Moscow brokerage firm Troika Dialog. </p> <p> Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright  ordered the Export-Import Bank today to reject a $500 million loan for Russia ''for the time being, '' arguing that the state-affiliated oil company that would receive it is an example of resistance to economic reform. </p> <p> After a day of frantic meetings in which Dr. Albright tried unsuccessfully to persuade the independent agency to defer consideration of the loan guarantees, she invoked a rarely used law to block the loan. </p> <p> Behind a display case filled with cassettes of Cuban music from decades past, Wilfredo del Rio keeps another oldie under glass. It is a photograph of Fidel Castro, smiling and youthful, taken in the heady days after the revolution triumphed in January 1959. </p> <p> ''I have it guarded, like a relic,'' said Mr. del Rio, a cashier at the store in the Barrio Colon section of Havana. ''It is something big for us. We love Fidel a lot. He has his defects like anyone else. But I consider him to be the man of the century.'' </p> <p> The newly emboldened Russian military has now embarked on a modern version of what Rudyard Kipling in 1901 called ''the Great Game'' -- that struggle against the West for economic and political power in the Caucasus and Middle East. </p> <p> A war on terrorism out of Chechnya is its excuse. Next week's elections to the Russian Parliament are the immediate cause of the systematic massacre of the dark-skinned Muslim troublemakers. The blood-thirstiest of the Russian politicians are getting the most support, if we can believe the easily rigged polls. </p> <p> If you think it's easy being a pro-Western, pro-market politician in Russia these days, get an earful of the first question asked Anatoly M. Chubais during a radio interview this week. </p> <p> ''There is a widespread attitude,'' the interviewer said, ''that you have brought the country to the point of collapse -- taken the economy to an extreme, 'done animal experiments,' that you are 'laboratory scientists who do not know what life is,' that you have 'with the cruelty of vivisectors' pushed millions of people beyond the poverty line. Why should people vote for you?'' </p> <p> The Clinton administration asked the Export-Import Bank of the United States today to delay $500 million in aid to a Russian oil company as a protest over continued resistance to economic reforms and, more obliquely, to step up pressure to end the military campaign in Chechnya. </p> <p> But the chairman of the bank, James A. Harmon, said tonight that he had not yet received any communications from the State Department and that he expected that the board of the independent agency would probably reject such a request, which he argued was based on an extremely loose reading of the law. </p> <p> A few years ago, when an American company was seeking a toehold in the newly privatized and potentially lucrative Russian telecommunications market, it cut a secret deal with directors and officers at the Moscow telephone company. </p> <p> As part of the arrangement, which has raised legal and ethical questions and thrown a light on how some Western businessmen have operated in Russia, the American company, Global Telesystems, paid at least $65 million in stock and cash. Global paid the money to a company the insiders had set up in the Bahamas to avoid public scrutiny and taxes. </p> <p> Acknowledging that the Kremlin had underestimated the cost of defeating Islamic rebels in Chechnya, a senior Russian official said today that Russia spent 50 percent more for the war in Chechnya last year than it initially planned. </p> <p> The soaring economic, military and human costs reflect the intensity of the fighting in the breakaway republic and the inability of the Russian forces to bring the conflict to an early close. </p> <p> In a city where banks sprout like mushrooms, and die just as fast, the money-moving network described in the unfolding Bank of New York case quickly branches into a web of control and ownership. Some strands reach to the highest levels of Russian finance and government. </p> <p> And adding to the flavor, the two Moscow banks that figure prominently in the accounts of Lucy Edwards and Peter Berlin -- the couple who pleaded guilty in New York on Wednesday, opening a new window in the case -- were not really banks at all, according to Russian bankers and United States investigators. </p> <p> AGREED. It wasn't such a good idea for Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer, to try to open its advertising campaign in the Moscow Metro for its first Russian store with a picture of a bed and the slogan, ''Every 10th European was made in one of our beds.'' </p> <p> Johannes Stenberg, the Ikea marketing manager for Russia, acknowledged the error. ''The sensitivities of Russians are higher than we are used to,'' he said. The Metro management declared the slogan in bad taste and, Mr. Stenberg added, ''said we couldn't prove it.'' </p> <p> If President-elect Vladimir V. Putin is going to fight corruption and lawlessness in Russia, as he has vowed to do in the wake of his election last month, he might start here on the southern shore of the Baltic Sea. </p> <p> This territory of rolling farmland where Mr. Putin's wife, Lyudmila, grew up and where the 18th-century philosopher Immanuel Kant devoted much of his life to the study of morality is about as corrupt as any in Russia. </p> <p> When this newspaper last looked in on Viktor Kuzmin, an eon ago in 1990, Russia was still in the Soviet Union. And Mr. Kuzmin, 45, a brash, elfin rebel, was kicking hard at its tottering legs. </p> <p> An unrepentant capitalist in a Communist state, Mr. Kuzmin seemed destined for greatness, or maybe prison. He was building his own 10,000-square-foot home, a shocking act for someone not even a Communist Party member. He had subverted state curbs on ownership by declaring himself a business. He ran his own construction company and planned to start an investment bank. </p> <p> Russia's next federal budget should be balanced for the first time in the government's 10-year history, even allowing for a sizable increase in social spending, Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov told the cabinet today. </p> <p> Mr. Kasyanov, until last month Russia's finance minister, said federal spending in the proposed 2001 budget totals about $38 billion, or roughly 17 percent of Russia's gross domestic product. Inflation was estimated to run about 11 percent a year, slightly below the 12 to 14 percent projected for 2000. </p> <p> On a day largely devoted to displaying its political and fiscal mastery, the Kremlin issued its long-awaited plan to overhaul Russia's creaking economy today. True to predictions, it was the very model of modern Western economic theory. </p> <p> It was also considerably bolder than almost any plans that most Western nations have ever tried to push past suspicious voters and hardened special interests. But given the overwhelming popularity President Vladimir V. Putin is enjoying these days, outside experts say that for the moment, anyway, it actually has a chance to become law. </p> <p> At 77, President Heydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan is a wily veteran of Soviet politics and of the K.G.B., an 18-year leader of Communist Azerbaijan and, for the last seven years, president of the newly independent country of the same name. </p> <p> He has some advice for his Russian counterpart, Vladimir V. Putin, a comparative political novice and former K.G.B. agent: deal with former Soviet republics as equals, not as client states with interests and policies subservient to those of Moscow. </p> <p> On the street here these days you hear French, Swedish, Russian, Japanese and at least half a dozen other foreign tongues. It is not tourists who give the city this cosmopolitan air, but business executives slinging around expressions like informationsteknologi (Swedish for information technology) and keizai kaihatsu (Japanese for economic development). </p> <p> Not too bad for a city that 80 years ago, under the alias Zenith, was branded as hopelessly small-minded and provincial by Sinclair Lewis in his novel ''Babbitt.'' </p> <p> Bill Clinton today was a president caught between two summit meetings, one in Camp David dealing with the oldest and thorniest problems in diplomacy, the other in Japan approaching the newest and vaguest issues of global inequity. </p> <p> The meeting on the Maryland mountaintop was grueling, but Mr. Clinton was not going to leave while there was even a glimmer of hope that he might achieve a legacy-enhancing breakthrough in the pursuit of Middle East peace. </p> <p> For much of the last decade, Russia's government had promised that it would reduce the country's huge tax burden. Last week it finally did. But the changes, business owners say, do not go nearly far enough. </p> <p> Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, businesses have been plagued by a tax system so complicated and burdensome that most have chosen to keep big chunks of their revenue hidden. Armies of bureaucrats, many of them prone to bribery, make operating even more expensive and turn company accountants into tax negotiators. Even losses are taxed, while slender profits can turn into losses after taxes. </p> <p> Federal prosecutors today filed a civil suit contending that two Harvard University advisers who helped mold Russia's economic reforms in the mid-1990's misused their government-financed positions in pursuit of personal gain for themselves and their wives. </p> <p> The two advisers, Andrei Shleifer, a prize-winning economics star and tenured Harvard professor, and Jonathan Hay, a former Harvard legal expert, deny any wrongdoing. Harvard University, too, rejects the accusation that it failed in its obligation to supervise the advisers. </p> <p> The Novokuznetsk Aluminum Plant here turns out 276,000 tons of metal a year, more than 10 percent of Russia's total production and enough to build more than 3,500 Boeing 747's. </p> <p> It makes a profit on every ton by selling its ingots abroad for foreign currency after processing it in Russia, where workers' wages and supplies are priced in rubles far below world cost. </p> <p> The factories built as part of the great Soviet industrialization undertaken for Stalin, Georgia's native son, stand empty. The ugly concrete apartment houses for the workers are crumbling. The shops display few wares, and every traffic light is off to save electricity. </p> <p> Only the soup kitchen seems to be thriving as a line snakes out the door. </p> <p> Western powers gave tens of billions of dollars in aid to Russia with no comprehensive strategy, and, at least partly as a result, the programs failed to bring about the desired capitalist transition there, a Congressional study has concluded. </p> <p> The study, by the nonpartisan General Accounting Office, raises questions about what has arguably been the highest foreign policy priority of the United States: making sure Russia did not become hostile after the collapse of Communism in 1991. Many Clinton administration officials supported a huge amount of international aid and a ''big bang'' approach to change in which Russia was encouraged to sell state companies rapidly and overhaul banks as a way of making the nation both capitalist and democratic -- and of ensuring that Communists could never regain control of the economy. </p> <p> In the intensive-care unit at Hospital No. 1, there are 12 beds for the near-dead. One morning 10 unfortunates lay there, mostly unconscious and virtually naked beneath tobacco-colored sheets. </p> <p> The first had ignored an earache that grew into a raging bacterial infection of the brain. The second, third and fourth shattered their bodies in auto accidents. The fifth, sixth and seventh bloodied their brains in mostly drunken falls. </p> <p> When the chest pains first gripped him that February day in 1998, Anatoly Iverianov was driving a tractor through one of the birch-and-pine forests that carpet Russia's border with Finland, dragging fresh-cut logs to a wood lot. </p> <p> ''I had a glass of vodka,'' he said. ''I thought that would help.'' </p> <p> If Ina Chaikovskaya does not have it all, she has more than most women in this ancient military town: brains and pluck, an apartment and a Zhiguli sedan bought with profits from her own business, a pointed wit. </p> <p> What she does not have, and would like, are a husband and children. At 37, she is running out of time. </p> <p> Dmitri Chernov was near despair as he recounted his difficulties making ends meet. ''Russia is a rich country, with tremendous natural and human resources,'' he said. ''But there is no one to manage this wealth properly.'' </p> <p> Mr. Chernov is neither a businessman nor a politician. He is a Russian auto mechanic, yet his complaint about a lack of capable management in Russia is often heard among ordinary Russians, few of whom have benefited much from 10 years of chaotic and poorly managed attempts at economic reform. </p> <p> Natalia Kostina lay flat on her back on a metal examining table in this city's tuberculosis hospital, staring impassively at the ceiling. In an instant, a doctor jabbed into her abdomen a thick needle attached to a syringe and pushed in a few cubic inches of air. </p> <p> A moment later the needle was withdrawn and Ms. Kostina, silent and stoic, got off the table and returned to her room. Her treatment was over for another week. </p> <p> For Russia, this was a year of a startling economic rebound, driven in part by soaring oil prices and the after-effects of a currency devaluation. Yet investors remain wary, looking for signs of meaningful change before committing new funds. </p> <p> Five years ago, government reformers were scrambling to control raging inflation and to hold the nation's finances together. Now, they are haggling with parliament over how to spend post-Soviet Russia's first budget surplus. Consumer spending is forecast to rise as much as 9 percent this year  compared with declines in the last two years. The economy is expanding at an annual rate of 7 percent, regaining ground lost in the previous decade, and investment is up 18 percent. Even ills that strangled the economy for years, like a reliance on barter and unrest over unpaid wages and pensions, have eased with the economy's rebound. </p> <p> With its rolling, barren bluffs and rocky coastline, and its migratory white whooper swans outnumbering people here each winter, this frigid crab-fishing town is about as deep into the backwater as one can get in this heavily urbanized and modernity-crazed country. </p> <p> The modest grid of streets and unfussy manners of its residents give this small town the feel of Down East Maine -- 20 years ago that is. When a foreigner checked into one of the two hotels, a request for a room with an Internet-friendly phone drew a puzzled stare. Moments later came the discovery that cable television and CNN had not reached the northeastern tip of Japan either. </p> <p> Russia's official creditors issued a stern warning today, telling the government that it had no economic basis for putting off payments on $48 billion in debt. </p> <p> The creditors said that, given Russia's favorable economic situation nowadays, they expected it to pay both the interest and the principal. </p> <p> ANOTHER emerging-markets crisis erupted last week. But while it rattled many foreign markets a bit, by the time Turkey devalued its currency on Thursday by letting it float freely, it appeared that there would be little lasting fallout from this rocky episode. </p> <p> But if you invest in these risky markets, don't take that as much comfort. Turkey is small potatoes. Its bonds make up only 1.9 percent of the closely watched Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus compiled by J. P. Morgan. Argentina's bonds are 23.1 percent of this index. And Turkey, unlike Russia in 1998, was not a place where hordes of foreign investors had flocked in hopes of big returns -- and then tried to leave all at once. </p> <p> Turkey's devaluation of its currency yesterday seemed to take some of the pressure out of the latest emerging-markets crisis. Most damage in other nations' financial markets came earlier in the week as the crisis grew. </p> <p> And emerging-markets experts said that they did not expect the events in Turkey to have much of a continuing effect on other markets. ''The direct impact of Turkey should be very limited,'' said Desmond Lachman, director of emerging-markets economic research at Salomon Smith Barney. </p> <p> Far above the Arctic Circle in Russia's northernmost region, a group of Moscow entrepreneurs has just staged a takeover. The effort, however, was aimed not at a company but at the regional government. </p> <p> The group is led by Aleksandr Khloponin, a 35-year-old former banker who came here four years ago from Moscow to overhaul a giant metals company called Norilsk Nickel. He was sent by his politically connected boss, Vladimir Potanin, who had snapped up Norilsk, one of Russia's economic crown jewels, when the government was selling off state businesses. </p> <p> Seeking to bolster a struggling ally, President Bush telephoned Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit of Turkey today to offer his support for the country's efforts to cope with its second economic crisis in three months. </p> <p> Mr. Bush, in a five-minute conversation, expressed support for Turkey's economic overhaul and discussed the importance of continuing to work with the International Monetary Fund, the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said. </p> <p> For the last 10 years, ever since the breakup of the Soviet Union introduced a market economy to Russia, the Saratov Aviation Factory has been struggling to do what it does best: make airplanes. But as old dreams are eclipsed by new realities, it has become increasingly clear that it is a losing battle. </p> <p> A decade ago, the factory in this city on the Volga River 400 miles southeast of Moscow belonged to one of the largest aerospace companies in Russia. The government and the military were its biggest customers, though airlines from Asia to the Caribbean bought Saratov's YAK-42 short-haul commercial jet. But demand for planes, both civilian and military, collapsed along with the Soviet Union, and the market has remained depressed. </p> <p> President Bush's treasury secretary described a new approach today for dealing with Japan as the world's largest and second-largest economies appear headed into decline, suggesting he would abandon Washington's constant stream of advice to the government in Tokyo and try working directly with Japanese executives he came to know while running Alcoa. </p> <p> In an interview this morning, the new secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, also said that he thought the Clinton administration's efforts to rescue the Russian economy when the ruble collapsed in 1998 were ''crazy,'' and he strongly suggested he would refrain from participating in multibillion-dollar economic bailouts aimed chiefly at stabilizing the currencies of countries where corruption and mismanagement led to crisis. </p> <p> After much speculation and many delays, Mir is finally coming down -- hard, hot and soon. </p> <p> The massive Mir space station, one of the most successful space ventures in history, is to end 15 years of circling the earth in about a week. With final nudging from the rockets of an attached cargo ship, Mir will dive into the atmosphere in a last, searing display of bravado as its blazing remains head for an isolated target spot in the South Pacific. </p> <p> With outrage still fresh around the world over the destruction of two giant Buddha statues in Afghanistan, a Taliban envoy says the Islamic government made its decision in a rage after a foreign delegation offered money to preserve the ancient works while a million Afghans faced starvation. </p> <p> ''When your children are dying in front of you, then you don't care about a piece of art,'' Sayed Rahmatullah Hashimi, the envoy, said in an  interview on Friday. </p> <p> American economic and security interests in the former Soviet Union are fundamentally linked. An economically stable Russia, integrated into the Western economy, would be far less likely to want to damage Western interests or dominate its neighbors, like Georgia, Ukraine and Moldova. Stable and prosperous neighbors would in turn support Russia's new generation of political and business leaders who seek success in the global market through domestic economic reform. </p> <p> How could we help build such improved relationships? There is one way the West could help Russia, and at the same time reduce Russian pressure on its neighbors: debt relief. Russia owes $48 billion of former Soviet debt to the Paris Club, the association of creditor nations that includes Germany and the United States. In recent weeks, Moscow has threatened to default on this year's payments and has demanded forgiveness or renegotiation. </p> <p> As they followed the economic crisis in Turkey with concern, leaders of the International Monetary Fund said today that they were creating a unit to anticipate and head off financial crises in countries to which the fund makes loans. </p> <p> The unit, to be known as the International Capital Markets Department, will consolidate the gathering and analysis of information that are now spread among other I.M.F. departments, said Horst Köhler, the fund's managing director. </p> <p> THE transition from Communism to a free-market economy is like changing the engine on an airplane while it is still flying,'' Gerard Roland of the University of California at Berkeley explained at a conference here. The challenge is to feed, clothe and house people -- and maintain their support for reform -- while overhauling the system of production and distribution. </p> <p> The most striking lesson of transition has been that all the former Soviet bloc countries took a steep nose dive after gaining political and economic freedom around 1989; only now are the more successful ones surpassing the meager level of output they had at the twilight of Communism. Economists at the Center for Economic Research and Graduate Education conference chalked up the slow progress primarily to underdevelopment and inadequate enforcement of commercial laws, and lack of encouragement of private start-up companies. </p> <p> Flush with oil money and bristling with a new assertiveness, Russia is moving to shake off the training wheels of Western help, particularly from the International Monetary Fund, and manage its finances on its own. </p> <p> Last week, Russia announced that it would no longer seek approval from the I.M.F. for its economic program, even though fund officials have said the program meets all their requirements. By the end of this month, it expects to catch up on all its foreign-debt arrears. And the economy is purring. </p> <p> Nearly a decade ago, as emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe shifted business and industry to private hands, stock markets began to sprout across the region. Now, a dearth of issues, stagnant trading volumes and investor apathy have analysts and traders warning that unless these markets combine and grow, they will have no future. </p> <p> Since foreign investors have bought out the most promising listed companies and bankruptcies have scuttled a rash of others, only half a dozen actively traded stocks remain in most markets. Small investors and local institutions prefer the safety and returns of bonds and foreign equities. Companies find it easier and cheaper to raise capital from private equity investment, bank loans and bonds. Foreign investors interested in regional stocks favor buying them through American or global depository receipts listed in London, New York or Frankfurt, where there is more liquidity. </p> <p> Michael Naumann, a former member of the German cabinet, was dining recently with Chancellor Gerhard Schröder when a newspaper was placed on the table. Above the headline, ''When Dwarfs Grow,'' was a photograph of the chancellor. Seeing it, Mr. Schröder joked, ''I'm not that small, am I?'' </p> <p> In fact, the dwarf in question was not the chancellor, who is of modest stature by his country's standards but far from that short. Rather it was his country, a nation long referred to in the postwar years as ''an economic giant but a political dwarf.'' Germany, under Mr. Schröder, is indeed assuming a new dimension. </p> <p> Ukraine's political crisis mounted today as Parliament voted overwhelmingly to dismiss Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko and his government, dealing a blow to the pro-reform movement that Mr. Yushchenko brought into office in December 1999. </p> <p> The vote of 263 to 59 marked the end of an uneasy alliance between the prime minister and President Leonid D. Kuchma, the former Soviet rocket factory manager who has governed the country as prime minister and then president since 1994. </p> <p> The spring day was idyllic  temperature near 50 degrees, not a cloud to mar the flawless sky and a fresh dusting of snow on the ancient fir trees clinging to the jagged Alatau mountains. </p> <p> A narrow road meandered alongside a swift river until a rock slide blocked the way. Some animal, most likely a wolf or Central Asian lynx, had crossed the slide, and its solitary tracks led off in the distance. </p> <p> Leaders of the International Monetary Fund, responding quickly to early rumblings from the Bush administration, pledged today to devote themselves to preventing financial crises around the world in an effort to avoid the multibillion-dollar bailouts that were a common occurrence in the late 1990's. </p> <p> After a weekend of talks among member nations of the fund and the World Bank, financial leaders made upbeat comments about the slumping world economy and promised to support a multibillion-dollar fight against infectious diseases in poor nations. </p> <p> Manuel has two jobs: one that the government provides and another that provides for him. </p> <p> By day he is a carpenter renovating once-elegant buildings into hotels and shops for the state, earning the equivalent of about $7 a month. By night, after having slipped a third of his pay to his foreman to leave work early, he steers tourists to private restaurants or sells them black-market cigars and rum. </p> <p> Newly installed Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has restarted debate over altering Japan's constitution. The relationship between Japan's political elites and their 1946 constitution has long been vexed. The question now is why constitutional debate has resurfaced and what it may portend for Japan and the world outside. </p> <p> For years, Japanese conservatives have claimed that the ''MacArthur'' constitution of 1946 not only demeans Japan's armed forces, but also hampers the nation's ability to fulfill its United Nations obligations. Article 9 of the constitution forever renounces war as a right of the state ''and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes.'' </p> <p> THERE is a new sign hanging at the entrance of the Gorky Automobile Factory, one of Russia's biggest carmakers, located 260 miles east of Moscow: ''The Buyers of Our Cars Pay Our Salaries.'' </p> <p> At this Soviet-era factory, quality had never been a priority. Nor was profit. The plant has been teetering on the brink of insolvency for years. Its trademark Volga sedan, the limousine of Soviet bureaucrats, has not changed much since the early 1970's, when it was designed. </p> <p> IN Russia, a country where governments and economic programs used to change with the seasons, the economy for a third consecutive year is consistently -- and curiously -- stable. </p> <p> The government's budget has been in surplus for two years now. Russia has sworn off assistance from the International Monetary Fund, and in February the government began paying all of its foreign debts in full for the first time in post-Soviet history. The economy expanded 8.3 percent last year. </p> <p> But Russia has only begun to crawl back from a decade of economic decline during which its economy shrank by half. The revival stems in large part from a ruble devaluation of two-thirds in 1998 and two years of high world prices for oil and natural gas, Russia's main exports. The economic rebound, however, has made Russian industry more attractive to investors, particularly to people like Oleg Deripaska and others who made fortunes from Russian natural resources like aluminum and oil. </p> <p> Economists, though, are beginning to ask how long Russia's recovery will continue. In recent months, statistics have suggested that Russia's economic growth is slowing. Industrial production in April was 3.6 percent higher than in the same month a year earlier, according to Goldman Sachs; that is down from a 9 percent growth pace early in 2000. </p> <p> At the same time, inflation has begun biting into the competitiveness of industry, and the country remains perilously dependent on commodities. Three raw materials -- oil, gas and metals -- account for 75 percent of Russia's export earnings. Economic reforms, to encourage banks to finance new businesses, for example, and open utilities to competition, are proceeding, but slowly. </p> <p> ''There's still a long way to go before we can be fully confident about sustainable growth,'' said Christopher Granville, a strategist at United Financial Group, an investment bank based in Moscow. </p> <p> Probably the biggest challenge for President Vladimir V. Putin in the next several years will be to strengthen the rule of law in Russia, economists and business owners said. Economic reforms under his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin, focused on dismantling the Soviet system, not on building institutions needed for a market economy. The ensuing chaos let down almost all barriers to theft and corruption. </p> <p> Russia's legal system has suffered. Executives in corporate battles often bribe prosecutors and judges, who earn an average of about $200 a month, to open baseless criminal investigations of their competitors or to let them snatch companies from their legitimate owners through forced bankruptcies. </p> <p> Economists say that without protection of property rights -- from state officials and business rivals -- Russians will not begin bringing back the billions of dollars that they have saved abroad, and foreign investors will stay far away. </p> <p> As a first step toward fixing this problem, the Kremlin last month submitted to Parliament a plan to reorganize the court system by making it independent of local elected officials and by stripping judges of their immunity from prosecution. The plan would quadruple judges' salaries over several years. </p> <p> Businesses have also applauded changes to the tax system that streamline and lower rates. </p> <p> In other areas, however, the government has been slower to make changes. Some initiatives, like a plan to reduce bureaucracy, have been watered down on the way to Parliament. Others, like overhauls of the banking system and natural monopolies, languish in government committees. </p> <p> Banks in Russia have yet to begin lending significant amounts to the the economic sectors where the money could be used best, some economists say. Cash-rich Russian entrepreneurs have started acting as their own investment bankers, circumventing banks. </p> <p> GOVERNMENT officials defend their record by saying the necessary reforms are so complex and far-reaching that they cannot be drafted hastily. Institutions, such as a strong legal system and an effective banking sector, took centuries to build in other countries, they say, while Russia emerged from Communism only 11 years ago. </p> <p> ''These are major obstacles,'' said David J. Herman, head of General Motors in Russia and the former Soviet Union. ''What is the government doing to address these issues? The answer is 'something,' but it hasn't reached the point of success and breadth that makes you feel we are out of the woods.'' </p> <p> While foreign scrutiny of Russia's economic progress has centered on the government's reform checklist, some economists say Russian companies are more powerful agents of change. In the current improved economic climate, businesses are beginning to make investments and undertake corporate reorganizations that, for better or for worse, are leading economic change in the country. </p> <p> ''The most important thing is what you see on the private-sector side,'' said Peter Boone, head of research at Brunswick UBS Warburg, an investment bank in Moscow. ''Big oil companies and exporters are improving their own operations and buying up companies. That is what will drive change.'' </p> <p> The seven biggest exporters that trade on the Russian stock market have combined annual revenue equal to that of the federal government, Mr. Boone estimated. </p> <p> ''That's major financial power,'' he said. </p> <p> Like many Poles, Wladyslaw Rancman spent some time in the United States. His favorite idiomatic expression, in entertainingly warped Chicagoese, appears to be ''by the way.'' As in: ''His father is more smart, by the way.'' </p> <p> But his assessment of Bush the son was fond and forgiving, and that sums up the warmer reception that George W. Bush received today in Poland than elsewhere in Europe. </p> <p> President Jiang Zemin of China arrived in the Russian capital today for a state visit that is to culminate Monday in the signing of a treaty on friendship and cooperation. It will be the first such pact since 1950, when Moscow and Beijing allied themselves against the West. </p> <p> Russian and Chinese officials have said in recent weeks that the treaty -- and a political declaration that accompanies it -- do not represent a military alliance and that the accord is not aimed at ''any third country.'' Yet strengthening Russia's economic and political bonds with China will unavoidably be viewed as a response to the dominance of the United States and its European allies in post-cold-war international affairs, a number of political analysts said. </p> <p> Red Square is such a vast affair, a sprawling stretch of windswept cobblestone and towering cathedrals, that it is easy for summer's swarms of tourists to miss its small charms, like the round dais from which czars addressed the masses. No one, on the other hand, will miss the skin cream ad. </p> <p> No one can. An immense photograph of a joyous family and its exceptionally clean pores, the billboard dominates the square's northern entrance, covering much of the breadth and four-story height of the State Historical Museum. </p> <p> After decades of shopping in small, drab stores with generic names like ''food'' and ''furniture,'' Moscow is rapidly awakening to Western-style modern retailing. Both foreign and home-grown chains are rushing to open new supermarkets and malls this summer to meet the growing demand in this expanding economy. </p> <p> Ikea of Sweden -- whose first home-furnishings store here, opened last year, is now its busiest worldwide -- plans to rapidly add two more stores. Ramenka of Turkey, whose Ramstore malls include a supermarket, movie theater and food court, is hustling to open its 10th location by the end of the year. Big retailers from Germany (AVA and Metro Cash and Carry), France (Auchan), Finland (Kesko) and the Netherlands (Spar) are all in the process of opening stores here. </p> <p> Just how much the world has changed, at least on the surface, becomes clear to me somewhere above Irkutsk, on board an Air China flight from Beijing to Moscow. My fellow passengers are mostly Chinese with a scattering of Russians. The in-flight entertainment consists of contemporary Chinese soap operas and old movies about revolutionary heroes battling various fascist enemies. But above Irkutsk we are provided with a History Channel documentary about the superiority of United States Navy destroyers. Phrases like ''fighting for freedom'' and ''the American spirit'' come gushing through our headphones as Navy helicopters release torpedoes and the guns of freedom boom. I look around to gauge Russian and Chinese reactions. Most people are fast asleep. </p> <p> The reason for flying this route is to test a hypothesis, or rather, a commonly received opinion, which is that the Chinese are managing their transition from Communism to capitalism better than the Russians. Russia is a mess, its economy wrecked in the Yeltsin years by ideology-driven shock treatment and grasping oligarchs, its daily life made a misery by widespread corruption and criminal rackets. China, on the other hand, is believed to have learned its lesson from the Russian experience. Mikhail Gorbachev's ''failure'' serves as a warning to the Chinese leaders against political reforms that would diminish the party's grip on power. Bolstered by enormous amounts of overseas Chinese investment, they have concentrated on economic reforms instead. Almost nobody in China, including most party cadres, actually believes in Communism. But an authoritarian one-party state fits the Chinese tradition, and most Chinese prefer it to the potential disorder of hasty democratization. </p> <p> Although countries in the former Soviet bloc have benefited economically in the decade since their shift from Communism, the United Nations reports, nearly 18 million children in those countries are living in poverty. </p> <p> As families struggle to cope with declining real incomes, they are increasingly putting children up for adoption or sending them to institutions for care, according to the study, which was released today by the United Nations Children's Fund. </p> <p> In the quiet snow of this old writers' community, Yuliya Latynina is at home working on her next novel. The window of her small second-story room opens out onto a birch grove and the house of Boris Pasternak, now a museum. </p> <p> The rustic Russian idyll is marred only by the red brick castles encircled by high walls and security cameras just down the road. These brash newcomers to the neighborhood are the homes of the ''new Russians,'' nouveaux riches who made it big in the decade of Wild East ''bizness'' that followed the fall of Communism. </p> <p> The last three months of 2000 were wonderful for foreign stocks -- even with the fallout from terrorist attacks and a global recession. Still, the first positive quarter in the last seven made the year only a little less painful. </p> <p> Foreign equities, including stocks in emerging markets, were up 8.1 percent in dollar terms in the last three months of 2001. That was their first positive quarterly performance since a measly 0.43 percent gain in the first quarter of 2000, according to the Morgan Stanley Capital International's All Country Index, excluding the United States. This index plunged 15.1 percent in the third quarter. </p> <p> The big American accounting firms were among the first foreign companies to arrive in Russia after the fall of Communism. They opened offices here and in other former Soviet republics, and rapidly landed many of the largest companies as clients. </p> <p> But in their competitive rush for a foothold, the Big Six (now Big Five) auditors lent their reputations to practices that in the West would be regarded as unethical if not illegal, current and former employees of the  firms said in recent interviews. </p> <p> Secretary General Kofi Annan told an audience of foreign policy experts today that terrorism was not necessarily linked to poverty but rose from a broader mix of problems caused by bad government, opportunistic politicians and militant leaders who exploit grievances. </p> <p> ''The poor have enough burdens without being considered likely terrorists simply because they are poor,'' he said. </p> <p> Spend half a day at Public School No. 4 here in the center of post-Soviet Georgia and it becomes a little clearer how an old way of life is dying and a new way is taking root. </p> <p> Georgia's school system is collapsing. Better to say it has collapsed. There has not been electricity in this three-story building for 12 years. </p> <p> ANYA Vanina is an unlikely troublemaker. She worked for years as a police officer and later peddled makeup for Mary Kay. But in this small Russian village, tucked in a forested corner of northwest Russia, she causing a stir. </p> <p> Take, for instance, Mariya Kozlova, a farmer from a nearby village. One Saturday in March, she made the hourlong bus trip to Ms. Vanina's tiny civil liberties center to map out her next move in a legal battle to save her youngest son. He deserted the army in St. Petersburg last autumn after he was beaten repeatedly by officers. </p> <p> One factor in Russia's transition from dictatorship to democracy has been the capacity of its recent leaders to break with their own pasts. Once Mikhail Gorbachev made it to the top of the Soviet system, he moved to repudiate its reliance on lies and brute force, setting the stage for the end of the empire and of the cold war. Boris Yeltsin, who rose to the Politburo by carrying out its orders, spent his presidency doing battle against the remnants of the Communist Party. Vladimir Putin, a former K.G.B. officer who almost everyone believed would be hopelessly out of his depth as Mr. Yeltsin's successor, has remained popular at home while accelerating Russia's alignment with the West. </p> <p> And then there are the also-rans. One of those, Aleksandr Lebed, died at the age of 52 in a helicopter accident on April 28 in Siberia. He was a paratroop general right out of a recruiting poster. Barrel-chested and steely-eyed, with a basso profundo voice, he had achieved prominence commanding a Russian division that stayed behind in the former Soviet republic of Moldova after the collapse of the Soviet Union. That background made him appealing to nationalists who hoped for a return to authoritarianism at home and for Moscow's domination of neighboring states. </p> <p> The elders danced in their fraying turbans as the opposition party's candidate for president campaigned across the swirling sands of the Sahel. On Election Day, the old men and other opposition supporters turned out by the thousands to vote for change in one of the poorest countries in the world. </p> <p> What happened in the election here in West Africa early in May made few headlines in the West. The army did not send troops into the shabby cities nor did tanks roll through windswept villages when the ruling party lost the presidency after 10 years in power. </p> <p> President Bush told his key allies today that the United States would cut off aid to the Palestinians if they failed to embrace the kind of changes he demanded on Monday. </p> <p> Stepping up his pressure for the removal of Yasir Arafat, he warned that ''we won't be putting money into a society'' dominated by corrupt leadership that helps to finance terrorists. </p> <p> The jagged peaks of this famed resort in the Canadian Rockies are the closest you can get to the lodge where President Bush and leaders from Europe, Japan and Russia are meeting for their annual summit conference -- at least 30 miles, and five ice-covered mountains, away. </p> <p> This distance is exactly what the Canadian prime minister, Jean Chrétien, wanted. After the debacle of last year's summit meeting in Genoa, Italy, where violent protesters battled the police (who shot one of them to death) and tried to surge past a chain-link fence surrounding the central city, Mr. Chrétien promised that when he was the host, no anti-capitalist slogans would sully the air, no gasoline bombs would be hurled at the police. </p> <p> Two senior Russian government officials said today that more money was now flowing into Russia than out, suggesting that Russians were bringing some of their ''flight capital'' back home to spend or invest after years of stashing it overseas. </p> <p> The finance minister, Aleksei Kudrin, and the governor of the central bank, Sergei Ignatiev, said that for the first time since such statistics had been kept, Russia would have a surplus in its capital account in the second quarter of 2002, meaning a net flow of capital into the country. </p> <p> Hong Kong has taken over from Tokyo as the world's most expensive city, London is the costliest capital in the European Union, and New York has the highest prices of any city in North America, according to an annual survey. </p> <p> In other results in the report, from Mercer Human Resource Consulting, released on Monday, Buenos Aires took the biggest plunge, falling from 23 to 133 after the country's economic crisis and devaluation. </p> <p> Giorgio Armani dropped in on Russia's capital in June for a six-day visit, the first in his long career, and came away impressed by the city's potential. ''Looking around, you can see that Moscow is seeking an identity,'' he said. ''You can see that there's this willingness to come to life quickly -- to catch up with life very quickly.'' </p> <p> Nobody who has watched the headlong, often heedless overhaul of this ever-less-seedy metropolis could argue with that. The more interesting question is whether the identity Moscow is seeking is the one Giorgio Armani is offering. </p> <p> Deep in the pine forest of the Russian north, a battle is being fought over the shape of a Russian economy increasingly concentrated in the hands of just a few tycoons. </p> <p> In an action giving new meaning to the concept of a hostile takeover, corporate raiders employed by one of Russia's most powerful businessmen have put a large pulp and paper mill -- quite literally -- under siege. A brigade of the tycoon's private security guards lies in wait, ready to take the mill, 575 miles northeast of Moscow. </p> <p> THE political career of Andrei Y. Brezhnev, grandson of the late Soviet Communist leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, could hardly be called auspicious thus far. </p> <p> The younger Brezhnev ran for Parliament in 1999 and won 2 percent of the vote. He tried to run for governor of the Urals region of Sverdlovsk that year but was thrown off the ballot. He made it onto the ballot for governor in Tula, south of Moscow, last year, but captured 1 percent, losing to Vasily A. Starodubtsev, one of the leaders of the August 1991 coup that hastened the end of the Soviet Union. </p> <p> Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld issued a stern warning to Moscow today, saying that expanding trade with Iraq would brand Russia a friend of terrorist states and frighten foreign investors away from its capital-starved economy. </p> <p> ''To the extent that Russia decides that it wants to parade its relationships with countries like Iraq and Libya and Syria and Cuba and North Korea, it sends a signal out across the globe that that is what Russia thinks is a good thing to do, to deal with the terrorist states,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said. </p> <p> After a week of intensive negotiations, diplomats here at the World Summit on Sustainable Development arrived at a plan early this morning that is intended to reduce poverty and preserve the earth's natural resources. </p> <p> The breakthrough came after diplomats worked late into the night on Tuesday to resolve a dispute over language in the conference's plan on health care for women. </p> <p> In this get-rich-quick Siberian city of hulking metal-refining plants and aluminum-baron fortunes, Larisa V. Khvoina is doing something unusual: running a small business. </p> <p> Her factory is small -- six rented rooms in a warehouse on the northwest edge of town. Her payroll is small -- five workers besides herself. And her product is small -- croutons, 3,000 packages of them a day. </p> <p> Their grandparents languished on Sakhalin, a former penal island, forced for decades to work here as ''the last prisoners of World War II.'' </p> <p> But as Asia's economic growth gallops into this corner of Russia's Far East, the demand for labor under free-market rules is sharpening for the thousands of young ethnic Koreans living here. </p> <p> They have already counted the four residents in the village of Pyalitsy on the Kola Peninsula above the Arctic Circle and confirmed the population of a hamlet called Ustye Vorzugi: one. In the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Area in Siberia, they needed helicopters to track down families gathering cranberries in the bogs. </p> <p> In some of the most remote hamlets and villages on earth, across a vast continent stretching from the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean, Russia has begun the monumental task of conducting a census. </p> <p> Russia got a new start last week on one of its boldest economic reforms in years: breaking up its vast electricity monopoly. </p> <p> But many questions remain about how the plan will be carried out, and investors and some lawmakers have warned that the process risks repeating the flaws and mistakes of privatization in Russia in the mid-1990's. That program was often manipulated by powerful insiders who stripped away valuable state assets and left outside shareholders with little or nothing. The Russian legal system is still trying to cope with the fallout. </p> <p> Chechnya is no Tuscany and no Rhone Valley, and it never was. But there was a time not long ago when it produced wines drunk by the Soviet elite and peasants alike. </p> <p> More than 35,000 acres of vineyards once flourished along the dry, sandy valley of the Terek River, which cleaves Chechnya in two. Each fall more than a dozen wineries turned the grapes into sturdy reds and whites, brandies and cognacs. </p> <p> Habiba was barely out of her teens when she was widowed in 1979 and left alone to raise three small children in the Afghan capital. </p> <p> Impoverished and increasingly desperate as war engulfed the country, Habiba was relieved when she heard from a neighbor about a way to ensure that her children would have enough to eat. She could put them, the neighbor said, into an orphanage run by the Soviet Union, which was then occupying Kabul. </p> <p> In a city whose skyline has long been dominated by concrete Soviet monoliths, some unlikely new neighbors have been appearing. </p> <p> A glass and metal spaceship-like apartment building squats behind the Foreign Affairs Ministry. A lemon-yellow wedding cake towers over the neighborhood where a famous Russian writer once lived. A curvy glass mall stands defiantly across from the old K.G.B. headquarters. </p> <p> Russia said today that it would not continue the agreement under which American Peace Corps volunteers work in this country. </p> <p> In recent months, Russia has increasingly criticized American Peace Corps volunteers there, accused them of spying and refused to renew their visas. </p> <p> New advertisements are appearing on Moscow's streets and subways. Comic-book-style stories portray the new quandaries of the Russian middle class. </p> <p> ''If we buy the car, we can't afford to remodel the apartment,'' says a woman with a knitted brow, in one ad. Then comes the happy ending. Her husband replies, smiling: ''We can do both! If we don't have enough, we'll take a loan!'' </p> <p> This country's official money is the ruble, but it takes only a stroll through an auto dealership, a pricey restaurant or a classy jewelry store here to learn which currency is truly king. A check of price tags there, and in thousands of other establishments, reveals that most expensive items are denominated not in rubles, but in U.E., pronounced ''oo-yeh.'' </p> <p> ''Oo-yeh'' is the acronym for ''uslovnaya yedinitsa,''or ''conditional unit.'' That is the euphemism for a wholly mythical wampum, which, by sheer coincidence, corresponds exactly with the exchange rate of the United States dollar. It has been the uncontested monarch of Russian money, the symbol of Yankee economic muscle, the yardstick by which all lucre is measured. </p> <p> In the first year of the new Russia, a group of students enrolled in a new Western-style graduate school to learn a long-forbidden academic discipline -- market economics. </p> <p> They were heady days. The Soviet Union had just collapsed. Economic reforms were beginning, sending prices spinning. New social classes of the fantastically rich and painfully poor were beginning to emerge. The students, 20-year-olds from Moscow universities, wanted to understand it. </p> <p> President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela failed today to win backing from President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of Brazil to include Russia, France and other ''friendly'' nations in a United States-sponsored mediation effort to restore peace to Venezuela. </p> <p> Mr. Chávez, who is facing growing demands from opponents at home to resign as Venezuela's economy buckles under a seven-week-long strike, said here today that he was ''grateful for the good faith and will to help'' shown by other nations. But he insisted that the mediation group formed by the United States, Brazil, Mexico, Spain, Portugal and Chile be broadened. </p> <p> Forty years ago, the two countries were the closest of political brethren, building Communist paradises, marching to the same revolutionary beat. But time changed everything. </p> <p> Today, while one brother, Cuba, has mostly stayed the course, the other, China, is brimming with entrepreneurs and foreign multinationals and has recently joined the World Trade Organization. </p> <p> They come on free shuttle buses and flock together in the food court. They play video games for hours in the Soyuz computer store. They are Moscow mall rats. </p> <p> The ''rats'' -- and their habitat -- are still rarities in Moscow. The first mall -- a gaudy tomb of luxury stores that appeared in 1997 underneath a central public square -- was more a museum than a place to shop. Later, a Turkish retailer began opening malls in Moscow's thickly settled suburbs. </p> <p> Facing rebellion by an odd coalition of Communists and pro-Western liberals, Russia's prime minister, Mikhail M. Kasyanov, defended the government today against charges in Parliament that its economic and social programs are leading more to national misery than to revival. </p> <p> In a speech to the dominant lower house of Parliament, called the Duma, Mr. Kasyanov offered a clutch of data as ''dramatic proof'' that Russia's economy was expanding rapidly. </p> <p> The Rolex store on Rodeo Drive here was not to be outdone by its neighbors. </p> <p> It was not enough to board up the front door and the plate glass windows with knotty pine planks painted yellow and to disguise all identifying signs. Rolex also ringed its second story with garlands of barbed wire. </p> <p> ''Sakhalin's 1st Escalator'' proclaimed The Sakhalin Times, one of two new newsweeklies that fiercely compete for English-language readers here. Atop the front page, a photograph captured the shiny new symbol of affluence ferrying a shopper between floors at the steel and glass Megapolis shopping center. </p> <p> In czarist days, this island on Russia's eastern edge was notorious as a place of political exile. In Soviet days, it was notorious as the base for the jet fighter that 20 years ago shot down a Korean passenger plane, KAL Flight 007. Now, Sakhalin is about to win fame as the world's newest oil boom town. </p> <p> It is Saturday night and tan young people in designer clothing recline on richly upholstered couches in a chic new nightclub called Chocolate. Bentleys and Ferraris are parked outside. A French D.J. named Red is playing lounge music. </p> <p> These are the children of Russia's new rich, the first generation to have come of age after Communism. Their parents came into their fortunes during Russia's property grab -- a few short years in the 1990's. They hungered for luxury after years of Soviet deprivation, flocking to resorts in southern France and filling Moscow's streets with Mercedes-Benzes. </p> <p> Prime Minister Mikhail M. Kasyanov sought to calm anxiety in his country's business community today by publicly stating that Russia would not review the origins of the fortunes made in its much-questioned privatization program. </p> <p> Mr. Kasyanov is the first senior official to publicly address the issue of whether the Kremlin will seek to wrest the fortunes from rich Russians who made their money in a lawless program of state-asset sales in the mid-1990's. </p> <p> I got my car stuck in the mud of a so-called road here. Way back in the 1920's, it was a smooth highway, but it has now disintegrated into a rough path -- and when a bridge collapsed recently, motorists were left to forge through a muddy bog as embracing as quicksand. </p> <p> That's the special accomplishment of the former Soviet Union: it not only repressed and impoverished its citizens in its seven decades, but continues to do so today, posthumously. </p> <p> To hear Russian officials, what's happening in Chechnya is not a war: it is a phase in an antiterrorism operation that has reached such a point of ''normalization'' that control was switched last week from the Federal Security Bureau, which handles war operations, to the Interior Ministry. After all, the Russians say, the Chechen people rebuffed the Islamic separatists by voting overwhelmingly in March to remain part of Russia, and they will vote again in October, this time for a Chechen president. </p> <p> Chechens agree -- but in their own way. ''What's happening in this country is not a war,'' they say. ''It is much worse than a war, with many more civilian casualties.'' I hear this repeatedly on buses, in markets and during conversations wherever I travel in this tiny, battered republic. For them, the switch to the Interior Ministry is merely cosmetic -- the soldiers and checkpoints remain -- and the coming election won't be a fair one. </p> <p> Yuri M. Lirmak is a Siberian with a sense of humor. So when he wanted a name for his new nightclub, he reached deep into his English dictionary for a word that would amuse him (and any passing foreigner). </p> <p> He settled on a short description of the Russian national pastime: Graft. </p> <p> The arrest on Saturday of Russia's richest man, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, and the decision yesterday by the Russian government to freeze $14 billion worth of stock in Yukos Oil, the company Mr. Khodorkovsky controls, is a reminder to foreign investors of how risky and volatile emerging markets can still be. </p> <p> Although the Russian government's effort to overhaul its economy has been applauded by outside analysts, the Russian Trading System stock index has plunged 16.5 percent since Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest, including its 8.1 percent decline yesterday. </p> <p> Cranes, eagles and puffins have no trouble crossing a 20-mile-wide finger of the Sea of Okhotsk that separates two national parks, one Russian and one Japanese. But the channel has long been a scary barrier for humans. </p> <p> Now, in an exercise of green diplomacy, environmentalists from both sides are proposing something untested in Asia, a cross-border park. </p> <p> With Saddam Hussein finally in custody and the future of Iraq looking a little more secure, we're hearing calls for President Bush to rip up the list of countries that the United States has deemed eligible to bid on prime contracts for rebuilding Iraq. Mr. Bush should stick to his guns; that list of 63 countries, all of whom helped the American-led coalition, was good policy. But it's important to be clear about why it is a good idea -- because in the piñata grab for the $18.6 billion in reconstruction contracts, some basic points have gotten lost. </p> <p> First, it is wrong of critics to frame inclusion on the list as a ''reward'' to our allies, or to say that countries left off it, like Russia, France and Germany, are being ''punished.'' Taxpayer-financed contracts should never be doled out as a reward -- that is precisely the kind of mind-set the United States needs to be trying to banish from Iraq, where the previous regime operated entirely ran on patronage. </p> <p> Russia's foreign currency and reserves rose last week to $70.6 billion, the Russian central bank said on Thursday, the fourth consecutive weekly gain and a sign that investor confidence in the country remains high despite the turmoil surrounding Yukos, the country's largest oil company. </p> <p> Reserves fell the week after the Oct. 25 arrest of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the former chief executive of Yukos, on concerns that the government was taking a step back from Western economic values. But capital is still flowing into Russia despite the arrest and the apparent demise of the country's biggest corporate deal to date, a merger between Yukos and its smaller rival, Sibneft. </p> <p> Russia's future will be defined as much by geology as by ideology. Unfortunately, while leaders can pick their ideology, they don't have much of a choice when it comes to geology. </p> <p> Russia has a lot of oil, and this inescapable geological fact will determine many of the policy choices available to it. Oil and gas now account for roughly 20 percent of Russia's economy, 55 percent of all its export earnings and 40 percent of its total tax revenues. Russia is the world's second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia, and its subsoil contains about 30 percent of the world's gas reserves. It already supplies 30 percent of Europe's gas needs. And Russia's oil and gas industry will only become more important. No other sector has the potential to be as internationally competitive, or as profitable. </p> <p> Stalin imprisoned people here, exploiting their labor to build an industry in icy isolation. His Soviet successors enticed them here with higher salaries and ideological cant to conquer the forbidding Arctic. </p> <p> Now Russia wants people to leave Norilsk -- only to find that most would rather stay, despite poverty, corrosive pollution from ever-billowing smokestacks and insufferable weather that plunges temperatures below freezing for most of the year. </p> <p> Despite needle-prick winds, numbing cold and winter days that crawl into constant darkness, miners seldom stop hollowing out the hills surrounding this Arctic town. </p> <p> Few of the workers, it seems, want to stay. But even fewer have better options. In a country where a quarter of the population lives in poverty and the average wage is $190 a month, a steady job is a good job. </p> <p> On Japan's northern edge, the long-running threat from Russia was as real as the debris on the beaches in 1983 from the Korean passenger plane shot down by a Soviet fighter jet from Sakhalin, a dagger-shaped island 26 miles north of here. </p> <p> In this windblown settlement, people have watched Sakhalin tossed back and forth by tides of war. Japan won the southern half of Sakhalin in the Russo-Japanese War, a grinding conflict that broke out 100 years ago, on Feb. 8, 1904. In the closing days of World War II, it was Russia's turn as Stalin's troops drove the Japanese across the narrow strait, turning this port into a fearful, refugee-clogged city. </p> <p> Russia's economy is more deeply dependent on oil and gas than previously thought, with energy making up an estimated 25 percent of output instead of the 9 percent attributed to it in Russia's own accounts, the World Bank said on Wednesday in an economic report. </p> <p> Russia's greater dependence on oil also meant that the country's extremely successful recovery is ''much more vulnerable to fluctuations in international oil prices,'' Christof Ruehl, chief economist for the World Bank in Moscow, said at a news conference here. </p> <p> WILLIAM F. BROWDER, an investor who is shaking up Russia's financial world by attacking its economic oligarchs, has come under the influence of a diverse cast of larger-than-life characters over the years. </p> <p> There was his grandfather Earl R. Browder, the Stalinist boss of the American Communist Party from 1932 to 1945, who died in 1974, when William was 9. ''All he was to me was Grandpa, the guy smelling of pipe smoke,'' said Mr. Browder, who was born in the United States and emigrated to Britain. But the elder Mr. Browder also impressed his grandson as a man of principle and an advocate for the little guy. </p> <p> Well done! Nadezhda I. Ostafeyeva's seventh-grade theater and ballet class at School No. 981 has gone cold turkey. </p> <p> If they keep it up, the students have a shot at winning a scholastic competition that is one of Russia's belated and, critics say, half-hearted efforts to reduce a leading cause of death in a country whose citizens are dying relatively young. </p> <p> Senior envoys of the United States, Europe, Russia and the United Nations gave a qualified endorsement on Tuesday to the stated intention of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel to withdraw from Gaza and parts of the West Bank in spite of the rejection of that plan by his own Likud Party. </p> <p> But the envoys, who were meeting at the United Nations to try to revive peace negotiations in the Middle East, stopped short of outright approval of the Israeli withdrawal plans, instead emphasizing the need for Israel to negotiate with the Palestinians and not to confront them with unilateral steps. </p> <p> There is one green poplar in the row of dead and brittle trees that line a shattered building here, and by coincidence it stands at the only doorway that is not in ruins. </p> <p> Both have been preserved by some mystery of nature through 10 years of war that have left behind a neighborhood of bombed and uninhabitable piles of brick. </p> <p> The Economic View column last Sunday described the role of competition in spreading unethical corporate behavior. It quoted Andrei Shleifer, an economics professor at Harvard, as saying that if unethical behavior drove down a company's costs, rivals would be compelled to behave similarly to stay in business. ''I really don't believe the saints-and-crooks theory,'' Mr. Shleifer said of the tendency to demonize business executives who engage in creative accounting. ''Evidence tells us very clearly, even the most saintly C.E.O.'s were involved'' in such accounting because of market pressure. </p> <p> The columnist was unaware of relevant background information about Mr. Shleifer. On June 29, a judge in United States District Court in Boston found in a civil suit that he conspired to defraud the federal government in the 1990's by investing in Russia while working on a federally financed project to help develop Russian economic institutions. </p> <p> In the battle between the Russian authorities and Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the founder of the Russian oil giant Yukos, the Kremlin appears to be winning. </p> <p> Mr. Khodorkovsky, the billionaire oligarch, sits in prison, awaiting the resumption of his trial next Monday. He faces 10 years in prison on criminal charges of fraud, embezzlement and tax evasion related to his creation of Yukos. And yet as the largest shareholder in Yukos, the country's top oil producer, he may hold more power than at first glance. </p> <p> AN educated work force is not essential for economic growth. Neither is a high saving rate. Manufacturing is not the most influential economic sector. </p> <p> These contrarian conclusions come from a new book by William W. Lewis, the founding director of the McKinsey Global Institute, a division of the McKinsey & Company consulting firm. Since 1991, the institute's researchers have conducted the most comprehensive international studies available on productivity by industry sector. </p> <p> From the moment he took office in January, Mikhail Saakashvili, the New York-trained lawyer turned president of Georgia, has rushed his nation along an agenda of ambitious design. </p> <p> Drawing on public support after chasing his predecessor, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, from power, Mr. Saakashvili has moved against corruption, pledged to revive Georgia's economy, steered his government closer to the West and vowed to unify the fractured country. </p> <p> Brawny bodyguards, curled wires stretching from ears to shirt collars, stood waiting and smoking cigarettes on the cobblestone street in an enclave of luxury boutiques here. </p> <p> Suddenly, cigarettes were tossed away, and the men rushed to escort their clients: the impressively dressed, impressively made-up women the residents call the New Russians, shoppers with money, who are not bashful about showing it off. </p> <p> The crisis in Ukraine is seen primarily as a political split between east and west. But the worry is that an economic rift could emerge as well -- with the country's industry-heavy eastern half allied with Russia and the western half left to rely on trade with Europe. </p> <p> But analysts and experts say Ukraine's economy is more complicated -- that both regions have economic ties that can contrast sharply with its political ties and are dependent on both trading partners. </p> <p> Kakha Bendukidze, the new Georgian economy minister, points out his window in downtown Tbilisi to the shabby refugee hotel framed by a setting sun. ''See that large building with the boarded-up windows?'' he says. ''It's going to be either a Four Seasons hotel, or maybe commercial office space.'' </p> <p> In one of the minister's first privatizations in the former Soviet republic, the 330-room Iveria hotel was sold at auction to German investors in September. As part of the $2.3 million purchase price, the investors bought out more than 1,000 refugees from a civil war here in the early 1990's who were still living in the Iveria, in what was supposed to be temporary housing. Each of the 270 families was to receive $7,000 -- market price, but not in downtown Tbilisi -- for a new apartment. </p> <p> Viktor A. Yushchenko, still basking in the glow of the street protests that swept him to power in Ukraine, appeared here on Friday to ask for help in creating ''a prosperous Ukraine in a successful, united Europe.'' </p> <p> ''I'm addressing you as a president,'' Mr. Yushchenko told the World Economic Forum's gathering of high-powered business executives, men, world leaders and intellectuals here. ''Please help Ukraine, and quite shortly, you'll see a European, beautiful nation.'' </p> <p> THE hasty exit of President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan from his capital, Bishkek, last week is being hailed with the same breathless exuberance that greeted Georgia's Rose Revolution in 2003 and the Orange Revolution that brought Viktor Yushchenko to the presidency of Ukraine in November. Democracy is on the march, we are told; yet another despot of the former Soviet world has been cast aside. </p> <p> It's a good story, but I'm afraid that plugging the political upheaval of this poor Central Asian nation into the paradigm du jour is akin to stuffing an elephant into a gorilla skin. </p> <p> If this is an outpost of tyranny, it was not immediately obvious in this one-road backwater buried in Zimbabwe's hilly southwest flank. </p> <p> In a clearing amid donkey carts, rafters-high scrub and at least 3,000 peasants, Zimbabwe's sole political opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangarai, delivered a throw-the-bums-out harangue aimed at crucial parliamentary elections later this month. </p> <p> Despite the common perception that the gulf between rich and poor has widened in the former Soviet Union, a World Bank study released yesterday found that poverty has fallen sharply across the region and that inequality has lessened since the financial crisis in Russia in 1998 and 1999. </p> <p> Forty million people moved out of poverty in Eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet Union from 1998 through 2003, leaving 61 million people still poor, the study found. The proportion of people living in poverty has fallen from one in five to about one in eight, household surveys of consumption on which the study is based show. </p> <p> ''Beautiful but poor'' is a common shorthand description of Lviv, a city of 800,000 people in western Ukraine, and it takes only a few hours here to sense the accuracy of the phrase. </p> <p> Lviv -- which is known as Lvov in Polish, Lemberg in German -- was once as European as the Austro-Hungarian Empire and wishes to be part of Europe once again. But it is not in Europe. At least not as defined by the border of the European Union, though that border is a mere 50 or so miles from here, where the Bug River separates Ukraine from Poland. </p> <p> General Motors, which in the United States struggles with ballooning pension and benefits payments, among other things, has more basic troubles in Russia -- the company was without engines for 11 days this month. </p> <p> G.M. said Monday that it had settled a dispute with a Russian business partner over the price of engines and other parts, and that production would resume Tuesday. </p> <p> Finance ministers from the world's richest countries and Russia said Saturday that ''high and volatile'' energy prices posed a risk to global economic growth that otherwise appeared solid. </p> <p> With booming growth in China and India absorbing oil, attention has been focused on the effect of rising demand in pushing up oil prices. The Group of 8, a club of the world's richest capitalist democracies and Russia, meeting Saturday in an icy, mist-covered Moscow, focused instead on the extremely tight supply around the world. </p> <p> Russian government officials said Wednesday that they were in talks with the country's large oil companies to restore a cap on gasoline prices here. </p> <p> In September, the oil companies made an agreement with the government to freeze gasoline prices at their current levels until the end of the year. Since then, some companies have kept to the deal, while others have raised prices at the pump. </p> <p> AT the tender age of 32, Oleg V. Deripaska, a former nuclear physicist, had already wrested control of the Russian aluminum industry from a netherworld of organized crime figures, mercenary local officials and ambitious tycoons like himself, securing a spot among the wealthy, powerful and secretive class of Russian businessmen known as ''oligarchs.'' </p> <p> A year later, in 2001, Mr. Deripaska established his political bona fides by marrying a woman who would soon become the step-granddaughter of former President Boris N. Yeltsin, a marriage that was Russia's social event of the year. </p> <p> Violent clashes in Budapest on Monday as the police tried to contain a month-old antigovernment protest movement marred the 50th anniversary of Hungary's uprising against Soviet domination. </p> <p> The police used rubber bullets, tear gas and a water cannon to disperse thousands of protesters who had gathered for a rally after a group of them took control of a Soviet-era T-34 tank that was on display for the commemorations and drove it toward the police. About two dozen people were injured, none seriously. </p> <p> Who would boast that their wares are the world's most expensive? Those selling to a select class of Russians. </p> <p> Rich ones. </p> <p> Montenegro has never seen anything quite like the Hotel Splendid. For almost half a mile, this complex of penthouse suites, swimming pools and boutiques stretches along the Adriatic shoreline providing unparalleled luxury for those who can afford it. </p> <p> But like many of the projects backed by Russian investment funds that have recently poured into this small country, the hotel has earned a less than glamorous reputation. Three bombs exploded at the site during construction. The police officer investigating the blasts was killed. When the hotel opened in September, guests were bused in under the watchful eyes of armed guards. </p> <p> Just before Christmas, in a fancy Azeri restaurant in Moscow, the German Embassy arranged a meeting between journalists and representatives of two leading independent human rights groups. </p> <p> It was a timely occasion given that the Kremlin of President Vladimir V. Putin had tried to restrict the activities of nongovernmental organizations after successfully muzzling much of the news media. </p> <p> Maria Sadina hunched over fading pictures of her parents, ethnic Germans who were deported in 1941 from the Volga region in Russia to one of Karaganda's many gulag camps. </p> <p> Ms. Sadina's father was imprisoned for praising the quality of a German-made tractor, and for a decade he worked as a slave laborer in the nearby coal mines. Her mother was sent to the Karaganda gulag simply for her German heritage. </p> <p> The dollar slumped yesterday and the euro climbed to a three-week high against the currency. </p> <p> A steady slide in the value of the dollar since late 2005, primarily against the euro and the British pound, has steepened over the last month amid indications that interest rates will rise in Europe, while the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates this year. </p> <p> The Kremlin is hoping it can put the focus on gains in the Russian economy at a forum for business leaders next month in St. Petersburg, highlighting growth that has been overshadowed by negative political news from Russia. </p> <p> The Russian government has billed the gathering in St. Petersburg as a kind of Davos for emerging markets, with an emphasis on Russia's oil-driven economy. </p> <p> The computer attacks, apparently originating in Russia, first hit the Web site of Estonia's prime minister on April 27, the day the country was mired in protest and violence. The president's site went down, too, and soon so did those of several departments in a wired country that touts its paperless government and likes to call itself E-stonia. </p> <p> Then the attacks, coming in waves, began to strike newspapers and television stations, then schools and finally banks, raising fears that what was initially a nuisance could have economic consequences. </p> <p> LEAD: Ivan Beshoff, the last survivor of the 1905 mutiny on the Russian battleship Potemkin, a harbinger of the Russian Revolution, died Sunday, his family said today. His birth certificate said he was 102 years old, but he contended he was 104. </p> <p> LEAD: Moscow consumers today faced a new and ultimate insult, a bread shortage, as the city's bakeries failed before the appetites of residents flooding back into the city from their annual August vacations. </p> <p> Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that he was prepared to resign as Soviet President as momentum toward acceptance of the newly proclaimed commonwealth of former Soviet republics built rapidly. The Russian Parliament gave the commonwealth an overwhelming endorsement, and the Asian republics moved toward joining. </p> <p> Mr. Gorbachev continued to argue forcefully against the commonwealth abruptly proclaimed by Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia on Sunday. But in a three-hour session with Soviet journalists in which he was alternately angry, proud and troubled, he appeared to be steeling himself for a resignation that seemed increasingly inevitable. </p> <p> The leaders of all four of the crumbling Soviet Union's republics that have long-range nuclear missiles have promised to carry out all cuts in nuclear weapons required of them under agreements made between President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and President Bush, American officials said today. The republics will also accept American advisers to help them dismantle the warheads, the officials said. </p> <p> In the last two days, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d has visited all four Soviet republics where intercontinental ballistic missiles aimed at the United States are based: Russia, Kazakhstan, Byelorussia and Ukraine. These four states, which have all declared their independence, also make up the core of the new commonwealth that is being formed to replace the Soviet Union. </p> <p> After a long day of disputes, the former Soviet republics agreed today that individual members of their new Commonwealth of Independent States could form separate armies, though strategic weapons would remain under a single command. </p> <p> The decision to let the states decide on whether to build their own forces or to remain part of a common defense was agreed to in a bargaining session of sharp differences and private compromise that let each of the 11 former republics decide its own military fate. </p> <p> A Lebanese newspaper reported today that Syria was negotiating a $2 billion arms deal with Russia involving advanced jet fighters and bombers and long-range surface-to-air missiles. </p> <p> The daily, Al Hayat, citing Russian informants in London, said the deal was about to be closed after the Syrians had agreed to pay cash in hard currency, as the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin demanded. </p> <p> Within hours of President Bush's announcement on Tuesday of deep cuts in America's military spending, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia went on television today to outline sharp arms cutbacks under way in the former Soviet armed forces. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin's program was in large part a summary of military reductions either previously pledged by Moscow or necessitated by the economic and political crisis in what is now the Commonwealth of Independent States. </p> <p> Potus's key sherpas finessed the Sotu to zero in on the build-down at David. </p> <p> Translation of that pastiche of acronyms and bureaucratese: "The President of the United States' national security aides passed up much of the hype surrounding the State of the Union address to concentrate on proposals for nuclear-weapons reductions at his first summit meeting with the Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, at Camp David this weekend." </p> <p> President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin made new arms control proposals this week that envision slashing American and Russian long-range nuclear arms by well over half and could eliminate the class of missiles considered the biggest threat to peace. </p> <p> But Mr. Bush's proposal, outlined in the State of the Union Address on Tuesday, asks Mr. Yeltsin to take a step that no Soviet leader ever entertained: give up his advantage in one area of nuclear arms competition, land-based missiles, in return for an important concession but not parallel cuts in the area of American advantage, submarine-based missiles. </p> <p> In preparation for President Bush's State of the Union address next week, the White House and the Pentagon are considering plans to sharply reduce or eliminate long-range nuclear missiles with more than one warhead, Administration officials said today. </p> <p> Some of the cuts, most likely in American land-based multiple-warhead missiles, would be made without conditions, while others would hinge on the response of the four former Soviet republics with long-range nuclear weapons. These republics, which operate under a unified command, are Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. </p> <p> Reappearing in public as abruptly as he disappeared, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia made an unexpected visit to the disputed Black Sea Fleet today, mounting the cruiser Moskva in an evident demonstration of Russia's concern for and claim to the former Soviet Navy. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin visited the fleet at Novorossisk, Russia's only major port on the Black Sea since the dissolution of the Soviet Union left the Crimea and much of the sea's north shore under Ukrainian jurisdiction, and the eastern shore in Georgia's. </p> <p> Ukraine has ordered the entire Black Sea Fleet and all ground forces based on the republic's soil to take an oath of loyalty to Ukraine, a move that has roused ominous new tensions with Russia and within the military. </p> <p> So far, the command of the Black Sea Fleet, which has its headquarters in Sevastopol in the Crimea, has refused to administer the oath, arguing that Ukraine agreed in forming the new Commonwealth of Independent States to leave the Navy under joint commonwealth command. </p> <p> President Leonid M. Kravchuk said today that Ukraine was in the process of smoothing out its sharp political and military disagreements with Russia. </p> <p> The 57-year-old former Communist leader, who was elected President of Ukraine five weeks ago, also said that he was about to replace a number of old-line Cabinet members with younger officials who favor a quick transition to a market economy. </p> <p> The Bush Administration is considering several plans to provide assistance to Russian nuclear scientists to keep them from accepting offers to work in developing nations trying to build weapons, the State Department said today. </p> <p> Congressional leaders and private organizations concerned about the spread of nuclear weapons are pressing the Bush Administration to act quickly to provide assistance not only to prevent a brain drain but also to speed up the process of dismantling weapons in the former Soviet Union, a process that the scientists could assist. </p> <p> In the latest twist in the dispute over the future of the Soviet military, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia flatly declared today that the Black Sea fleet belongs to Russia, not Ukraine. Disposition of the fleet is a crucial issue because it is one of the most valuable assets of the disintegrating Soviet military. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin's assertion underscores Russian sensitivity about the legendary fleet, which was the core of the Russian Imperial Navy beginning in the 18th century, and about its home port, Sevastopol, a historically Russian city that was besieged by the Turks and their allies in the Crimean War in the 19th century. The Crimea was made part of the Ukrainian republic less than 40 years ago. </p> <p> The central military command said today that its primary communications control over 300,000 troops of the former Soviet Army in Ukraine had been lost to Kiev military officials intent on nationalizing Soviet units in the republic. The number represents about one-fourth of the former Soviet units in Ukraine. </p> <p> The unilateral action deepened the political struggle between Ukraine and Russia over control of the military remnants of the defunct Soviet Union. </p> <p> The transfer of all short-range nuclear weapons to Russia from other former Soviet republics will probably be completed by May, two months ahead of schedule, a senior Russian general said today. </p> <p> Gen. Sergei Zelentsov, chief nuclear engineer in the Russian Defense Ministry responsible for the withdrawal of about 3,000 tactical warheads outside Russia, described the new timetable here at a conference of nuclear scientists from the United States and the former Soviet Union. </p> <p> The U.S. and Soviet Union are heading toward arms reduction agreements that will cut nuclear missile arsenals dramatically. That makes it all the more preposterous to go ahead with the "Star Wars" program. The plan to establish a joint early warning center to detect ballistic missile firings from almost any point on the globe offers an effective and symbolic measure of the new Russian-American relations. </p> <p> Other countries will be invited to join. That doesn't go nearly far enough to control proliferation of missiles. But it will be a good start in showing that major countries are prepared to act together against the techniques of aggression and blackmail they themselves invented. </p> <p> Four republics of the former Soviet Union have provided some details to the Bush Administration on plans to eliminate a number of strategic nuclear weapons over the next seven years and to concentrate those remaining on the territory of Russia. </p> <p> Using the framework of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty agreed to last July between the United States and the Soviet Union, the newly independent republics will remove all strategic nuclear arms from Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, the Administration has been advised. </p> <p> The Berlin wall has long since been pulverized and the Soviet Union is history. But Warsaw and Moscow are locked in a bitter quarrel over the withdrawal of the estimated 35,000 Soviet Army troops remaining in Poland. </p> <p> Although Russia has promised to pull out most of the soldiers by the end of this year, the two sides have confronted each other with astronomical bills for services rendered and the Poles have added claims for environmental damages. The impasse has brought bitter resentments on the Polish side and awkward feelings about the end of empire among the proud Soviet Army officers. </p> <p> Russian intelligence agencies with extensive information on Soviet activities in Indochina during the Vietnam War have agreed to help a United States Senate committee investigate cases of missing American servicemen, committee leaders said today. </p> <p> For the first time, files and other documents on American prisoners and deserters collected by the Soviet Union beginning in the 1940's will be turned over to American investigators by the Russian foreign intelligence service and other organizations, according to Senator John Kerry and Senator Robert C. Smith, chairman and vice chairman, respectively, of the Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs. </p> <p> Some of the top nuclear bomb designers of the former Soviet Union, aware of Western concern that they not sell their expertise to hostile powers, presented Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d today with a list of commercial scientific projects they were ready to work on if the West would just invest in them. </p> <p> In a remarkable encounter, Mr. Baker became the first Western official known to have visited Chelyabinsk-70, a top-secret military nuclear complex near the old industrial city of Chelyabinsk in the Urals. Chelyabinsk-70 and other secret military towns were not listed on published Soviet maps. A Russian official said the numerical suffix on the name was for postal reasons. </p> <p> With Ukraine adamantly opposed to entering into a common defense force with the larger Russia, the former Soviet republics seemed to slip deeper into disarray today over the future of their new Commonwealth of Independent States. </p> <p> Leaders of the 11-member commonwealth met in eight hours of private talks that officials later described as hardening their differences into two camps. One is aligned with Russia, which favors a single multirepublic conventional force as the successor to the Red Army, and the other with Ukraine, which fears a common defense could become dictatorial and is pushing ahead to form its own army. </p> <p> With the release overnight of 10 officers of the former Soviet army, held hostage for four days by Armenian irregulars in an effort to obtain arms, the immediate risk that the army would be drawn more deeply into the territorial war between Armenia and Azerbaijan diminished today. </p> <p> But as the Russian Vice President, Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, called for the withdrawal of regular troops from the region, the fighting between Armenians and Azerbaijanis continued, with reports of rocket and artillery attacks today on Agdam, an Azerbaijani town near the border of the disputed mountainous enclave called Nagorno-Karabakh. </p> <p> Animosity between Ukraine and Russia broke into the open at a summit meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States today. The Ukrainian President, Leonid M. Kravchuk, publicly lambasted Russia and the commonwealth, saying they had failed to resolve "a single political or military problem." </p> <p> As Ukrainian demonstrators outside branded the commonwealth as a successor to the "evil empire," Mr. Kravchuk asserted that the three-month-old association of former Soviet republics had failed to follow up on any of its decisions, and had proved helpless to stop ethnic conflicts in the Caucasus and in Moldova. </p> <p> A long-sought agreement to open the skies over the former Soviet Union, Europe and North America to reconnaissance aircraft flights was reached in Vienna today. </p> <p> Too late for monitoring cold-war troop and missile movements, the Open Skies Treaty will be initialed on Saturday and signed on Tuesday by the 24 nations participating in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. </p> <p> The quarrel between Russia and Ukraine over the Black Sea Fleet is not just about the great gray warships in this city's narrow harbor that, orphanlike, still fly the red hammer-and-sickle of the former Soviet Union. </p> <p> As most Russians and Ukrainians are quick to point out, the fight now testing the survival of the Commonwealth of Independent States has deeper historical roots. In many ways, it is really about the Crimean Peninsula itself, which is now poised for a referendum on its independence from Ukraine, and about Sevastopol, a navy town of faded elegance that dates to the reign of Catherine the Great. </p> <p> In Warsaw and other Eastern European capitals, the word "Yalta" often conjures up the conference at which the Western Allies of World War II in effect conceded to Stalin the right to dominate the countries from which the Soviet Army was driving its German foe. It meant, until the collapse of Communist rule in 1989, 44 years of subjugation to Soviet power. </p> <p> Not so here. In the White Palace in nearby Livadiya, the hilltop castle of the last Czar where the leaders of the Allies, Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin, met in February 1945 to decide the future alignment of Europe, the passing of Soviet power is acknowledged only by an exhibition, alongside that devoted to the conference. It honors the former owners, the Romanov dynasty. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin ordered the creation of a separate Russian Ministry of Defense today and named himself its acting head, thus taking the first step toward the establishment of a potentially powerful Russian army. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin's decision, which follows repeated failures within the Commonwealth of Independent States to resolve the fate of the former Soviet armed forces, appears to raise serious questions about the possibility of keeping a unified military command when the commonwealth heads of state meet in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, on Friday. </p> <p> Depending on who's talking, Ukraine's tussle with Russia over the former Soviet armed forces is either the front line in the fight for independent statehood or a dangerous folly. </p> <p> Either way, Ukraine's insistence on forming its own armed forces -- with its claims to the Black Sea Fleet and the oath of allegiance asked of the 700,000 military men stationed on Ukrainian soil -- has become the main source of growing friction with Russia. </p> <p> A conference of Western and former East bloc nations today discussed for the first time a possible military role as well as a political one for NATO in ending disputes within the former Soviet Union. </p> <p> Later, after a meeting with European Community ministers devoted to Yugoslavia, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said the United States would move quickly to recognize the independence of Croatia and Slovenia and would coordinate with European nations the recognition of the other Yugoslav republics, which could come as early as April. </p> <p> The four former Soviet republics that have strategic nuclear weapons have reached an agreement that will expedite the ratification of the strategic arms reduction treaty with the United States, Ukraine's President said today. </p> <p> Under the agreement, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan are to act as equal partners in the signing of a new protocol with the United States reconfirming the treaty, known as Start. </p> <p> The Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, in a sharp rebuke to competing claims by Ukraine, moved today to put the Black Sea Fleet under Russia's jurisdiction, raising the stakes in a game of brinkmanship now being played out by the two most powerful states to emerge from the former Soviet Union. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin's decree came as a response to a move on Monday by the Ukrainian President, Leonid M. Kravchuk, asserting Ukraine's legal authority over military forces on its territory, including ships from the Black Sea Fleet based in the Crimean port of Sevastopol. </p> <p> The Ukrainian Government is quietly taking steps to build its own naval force as Ukrainians and Russians await a political decision on the future of the Black Sea fleet, which has been a major point of contention between them. </p> <p> Ukrainian military representatives have set up a temporary base in an old training school for ensigns. </p> <p> At Fox Main, despite the collapse of the Soviet Union, it's still all systems go. </p> <p> Inside a white Kevlar dome, which looks like a jumbo golf ball, the new 24-foot-square antenna of the Fixed Position Search 117 long-range radar ceaselessly scans for friend and foe in the desolate Arctic sky. </p> <p> The former Soviet republics with battlefield nuclear weapons told the United States today that all of the weapons would be transferred to Russia by July 1, senior Defense Department officials said. </p> <p> The pledges, which followed threats from Ukraine that it was suspending transfers of its nuclear weapons, came in a series of private meetings Defense Secretary Dick Cheney held today at NATO headquarters with senior defense officials from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine stepped back today from a confrontation over control of the Black Sea Fleet, and agreed to set up a commission to work out a plan for its redistribution. </p> <p> After two telephone calls, the two Presidents decided to suspend decrees, issued this week, in which each had laid claim to the fleet, Mr. Yeltsin told members of the Russian Parliament today. The moves had caused a crisis between the two Slavic states that was threatening to split the Commonwealth of Independent States and open up the bitter question of the future of the Crimea, a prized peninsula in the Black Sea that now belongs to Ukraine. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin issued decrees today forming a separate Russian Army with himself as commander in chief and acting Minister of Defense. </p> <p> The announcement had been expected since March, when Mr. Yeltsin first bowed to prevailing sentiments in the new Commonwealth of Independent States and announced the creation of a Russian Ministry of Defense. </p> <p> President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine acknowledged today that he did not know Wednesday that all tactical nuclear weapons had been transferred from his country to Russia, where they are to be dismantled. </p> <p> Speaking to reporters at a news conference, he said that he had received a cable overnight from the Ukranian Minister of Defense telling him that all of the short-range weapons had been taken from Ukranian territory. </p> <p> The United States and the four former Soviet republics with nuclear arms signed an agreement today that opens the way for ratification of a 1991 treaty signed before the collapse of the Soviet Union to drastically reduce the number of long-range weapons stockpiled during the cold war. </p> <p> Three of the newly independent republics -- Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan -- also agreed to destroy or turn over all strategic nuclear warheads to the fourth republic, Russia, and to adhere "in the shortest possible time" to the 1968 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. </p> <p> Following are excerpts from the text of the protocol to the strategic arms treaty, signed here today by Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine and the United States: </p> <p> Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said today that his country had "reached the limit of our capacity" to help the countries of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and he launched an unusually blunt appeal to Japan to offer them more aid. </p> <p> Addressing members of the American Newspaper Publishers Association gathered at the United Nations, Mr. Kohl said that Germany had done as much as it could to help these countries make the transition from Communism to democracy and market economies.  He insisted that the time had come for Japan "to contribute more than it has up to now toward this reform effort." </p> <p> The world's five largest arms suppliers to the Middle East failed to agree this week on how to put into effect a year-old American initiative limiting conventional-weapons sales to the region. </p> <p> After talks on Thursday and Friday, the five countries -- the United States, Russia, Britain, France and China -- which supply the Middle East with between 85 and 90 percent of its conventional arms, reported no progress. China opposed a proposal to disclose agreements about the sales of weapons before they are delivered. </p> <p> The United States has threatened trade sanctions against Russia and India if the Russians sell missile technology that can help the Indians develop long-range weapons, Indian and Russian officials say. </p> <p> Moscow and New Delhi say the technology, for giant rockets to launch satellites into space, is entirely for peaceful purposes. But Western diplomats here say the sale would violate the 1987 Missile Technology Control Regime, an agreement adopted by the United States and other Western countries to block the spread of medium- and long-range missiles that are able to carry nuclear warheads. </p> <p> Since the end of the cold war, the military might of the former Soviet empire has actually grown modestly in size just across from this Arctic border outpost. The heavily armored divisions protecting the old Soviet northern flank have not withdrawn as they have in Central Europe. </p> <p> But in all other ways, the cold war seems as dead here as anywhere and security in the Nordic countries facing the old empire to the east is being defined increasingly in nonmilitary terms, like environmental security, economic and social stability in Russia and the improvement of Arctic trade. And if anything, these new security challenges are no less daunting than the old and familiar ones. </p> <p> India said today that Russia had pledged to honor a commitment made by the former Soviet Union to deliver advanced rocket-engine technology to India despite an American threat to suspend technical cooperation with both Moscow and New Delhi if the deal went through. </p> <p> Both sides, however, indicated that they would allow a review of the program by a committee of experts in order to satisfy the United States that this is not a weapons project. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine reached broad agreement today on the major disputes that have poisoned relations between their countries since the breakup of the Soviet Union, from ownership of the Black Sea Fleet to settling their bills. </p> <p> Those and most other sections of the 18-point accord they signed in Dagomys, a district of the Black Sea resort of Sochi, were agreements in principle, with details remaining to be worked out. Even so, they included several major political breakthroughs. </p> <p> A Russian document given to a Senate committee discloses that 125 servicemen previously listed as dead or missing in the Korean War actually survived and were turned over to Soviet interrogators in North Korea, leaders of the Senate Select Committtee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs said today. </p> <p> An unknown number of those servicemen were later transferred to Chinese custody and may have been sent to China, the Senators said. North Korea, China and the former Soviet Union consistently denied that any captured Americans were turned over to Soviet or Chinese officials. </p> <p> The United States is helping Russia and other former Soviet republics track and identify prisoners of war held in Afghanistan by Afghan guerrillas who fought the Soviet Army from 1979 to 1989, officials said today. </p> <p> American officials visiting Kabul recently stopped in Moscow and Kiev on the way home to deliver photographs of prisoners obtained from the Afghans, along with other information on P.O.W. cases. These officials say they believe that Afghan militias hold 30 to 50 former Soviet soldiers, most of the from Russia or Ukraine. </p> <p> In the last few months, the United States and Russia have quietly narrowed their differences over how to make additional cuts in their nuclear arsenals, well beyond those agreed to in the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. </p> <p> But the inability to close the remaining gap has led critics of the Bush Administration to say the United States is missing an opportunity to obtain radical reductions in the Russian arsenal because the Administration is too wedded to cold-war strategic theories. </p> <p> The American co-chairman of the commission searching for missing Americans in Russia said today that President Boris N. Yeltsin "misspoke" when he said American prisoners of war might still be there. </p> <p> "It's clear to me that he misspoke, because we have found nobody here that will tell us that Mr. Yeltsin's information was correct based on solid information," Malcolm Toon, a former United States Ambassador to Moscow, told reporters here. "I think he was acting genuinely, but I think he misspoke." </p> <p> When President Boris N. Yeltsin and President Bush meet on Tuesday, they will seek to cement Washington's budding friendship with the new Russian nation in two ways: through arms control and by bolstering Russia's economic reforms. </p> <p> Both efforts are needed, Administration officials say, because if Russia's painful transition to a Western-style market economy fails, a fledgling democracy could be snuffed out and a hostile dictator could come to power. </p> <p> Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, failed to conclude an agreement today on how to cut the number of nuclear warheads below the levels set in the recently signed strategic arms reduction treaty. </p> <p> But the two said they would keep trying in the week remaining before the next Russian-American summit meeting. </p> <p> Some nine months after gaining independence from Moscow, the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia remain stunted and struggling, their fledgling political and economic institutions still seeking stability. </p> <p> But in this city, founded in 1201, as in the nearby capitals of Tallinn and Vilnius, the months since the break with Moscow have produced a sometimes bewildering rush of change and new possibilities. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin returned here today from a successful week in the West and promptly issued a warning about growing Russian impatience with fierce ethnic fighting along the southern rim of the former Soviet empire. </p> <p> Ethnic Russians and Russian troops are involved in increasingly serious fighting in Moldova, a small former Soviet republic on the border with Romania, with Moldovan forces reportedly destroying 11 tanks of the former Soviet Army since Friday. Clashes involving Russians also have intensified in the South Ossetia region of Georgia, in the Caucasus region. </p> <p> On the face of it, the sweeping arms agreement announced today by President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia seems precisely the kind of political medicine Mr. Bush needs. </p> <p> It displays Mr. Bush in his preferred role of accomplished international negotiator and peacemaker, which since the Persian Gulf war has been gradually eclipsed, in terms of public opinion, by concerns about health care, jobs, education, the environment and the credibility of politicians. Nuclear disarmament is obviously an easier sell than sluggish economic growth. </p> <p> The latest Russian-American arms control agreement not only reduces their total nuclear arsenals from about 22,500 warheads to 7,000, but also does so in a way that eliminates the most threatening Russian nuclear weapons while allowing the United States to maintain its most advanced missiles, American officials and arms control experts said today. </p> <p> "We are talking about a very good deal," said Jack Mendelsohn, deputy director of the Arms Control Association. "On paper, it looks like the two forces will be reduced equally, but in fact the Russians will be giving up the backbone of their arsenal -- land-based multiple warheaded missiles -- while we will be retaining the area of our greatest strength, sea-based ballistic missiles." </p> <p> President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin announced an agreement today that not only sharply reduces their stocks of long-range-missile warheads, but also eliminates all multiple-warhead missiles based on land, the core of the old Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal. </p> <p> The accord was announced by the leaders in the White House Rose Garden just hours after Mr. Yeltsin began the first state visit to Washington by a Russian President. It must still be translated into a formal treaty, which United States officials said could be done within three months, then approved by the United States Senate and the Russian Parliament. </p> <p> Like so many of the drastic changes taking place in Russia, the agreement to sharply reduce the strategic arsenals of Russia and the United States is likely to be welcomed for the new era it heralds and resented for the collapse of empire it confirms. </p> <p> The agreement announced by Presidents Bush and Boris N. Yeltsin on the first full day of the Russian leader's visit to Washington seemed to come as a major surprise. None of the newspapers here had predicted it, and none of the evening news programs had any advance notice. </p> <p> Following are excerpts from statements and a brief news conference by President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, who spoke through an interpreter: BUSH STATEMENT </p> <p> Mr. President, let me just say that I'm pleased to announce that President Yeltsin and I have just reached an extraordinary agreement on two areas of vital importance to our countries and to the world. First, we have agreed on far-reaching new strategic arms reductions. Building on the agreement reached with Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus, our two countries are now agreeing to even further dramatic strategic arms reductions substantially below the levels determined by Start. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia told a Senate committee in a letter today that the Soviet Union detained and imprisoned American servicemen during World War II, when the two countries were allies, and afterward, often in violation of conventions governing prisoners of war. He also said Soviet officials had lied to the United States about the fate of missing Americans. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin's letter, released in translation by the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W.-M.I.A. Affairs, acknowledged for the first time that nine American aircraft had been shot down over the Soviet Union at the height of the cold war in the 1950's and that there had been survivors. </p> <p> Russia and the United States announced today that they had narrowed their differences over an agreement to radically reduce their nuclear arsenals. But they said further negotiations would be necessary at next week's summit meeting between President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin. </p> <p> Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d flew to London today and met his Russian counterpart, Andrei V. Kozyrev, for three and a half hours of talks that were scheduled at the last minute in an effort to wrap up a new arms accord before the summit meeting. But the two men emerged to say that though both sides had offered new compromises, gaps still remained. </p> <p> A coast guard frigate of the Black Sea Fleet raised the Ukrainian flag today and set off from a naval base in the Crimea for the Ukrainian port of Odessa, chased by other warships. Negotiations with the mutinous crew continued tonight. </p> <p> Russia and Ukraine have been squabbling over how to divide the Black Sea Fleet, which has some 300 ships. But at a meeting last month, Presidents Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine asked fleet personnel to be patient and not declare allegiance to either country, despite an earlier Ukrainian demand that fleet personnel declare their loyalty to Ukraine. </p> <p> Reflecting a change in arms control priorities, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee instructed the Bush Administration today to negotiate verification arrangements with Russia that would cover nuclear warheads in addition to delivery systems. </p> <p> The committee's move, which was proposed by Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware and supported by other Democratic members of the panel, represents a transformation of the arms control debate. In the past, lawmakers have insisted on tough monitoring measures for missiles and launchers to guard against possible Soviet cheating. But with the breakup of the Soviet Union, lawmakers see monitoring of warheads as a means of insuring that nuclear weapons do not fall into the wrong hands. </p> <p> The Russian Foreign Minister has caused a stir in Moscow by his warning this week that Communist and nationalist forces are manipulating the military in an effort to destabilize or overthrow the democratic Government here. </p> <p> The minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, speaking to Izvestia, warned that pressure for the Russian Army to intervene in support of Russian-speakers living outside Russia's borders, in hotspots like Moldova and South Ossetia, was being orchestrated by politicians opposed to President Boris N. Yeltsin. </p> <p> Fifteen miles and 23 minutes by hydrofoil from St. Petersburg, Kronstadt and its naval base can seem a world away: clean, orderly and disciplined in the way many Russians like to think life ought to be. </p> <p> There are no hawkers of cheap Turkish clothing; no prostitutes hanging around hard-currency hotels; no gypsies begging in the streets. </p> <p> Ignoring a temporary truce, dissidents fired a salvo of rockets today that set a Russian evacuation plane ablaze, stranding Russia's Ambassador and other diplomats and their families. Four Russian commandos aboard the plane were wounded. </p> <p> But two military transport planes escaped the bombardment and ferried 120 Russian Embassy workers, their wives and children safely out of Kabul with little more than what they could carry. The planes had circled around the mountains that ring the city, spewing dozens of flares designed to deflect heat-seeking missiles that were fired at the aircraft. </p> <p> The Black Sea Fleet, which has been both a symbol and a source of tensions between Russia and Ukraine, will be placed under the joint command of the two countries until 1995, according to an agreement reached today by President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine. </p> <p> Meeting near Yalta on the Crimean Peninsula, the two Presidents appeared arm in arm before television cameras, signaling an end to the exchange of threats and conflicting presidential decrees that have dominated talks over the fleet since the Soviet Union broke up last year. </p> <p> The main office building of the Bolshevik factory, part of a huge military-industrial concern, is built from the shell of a former church. On the wall outside is a plaque to the factory's true patron saint, Marshal Dmitri F. Ustinov. </p> <p> Marshal Ustinov, who was Soviet Defense Minister when he died in 1984, was known as "Mr. Military-Industrial Complex." This factory, which he directed from 1938 to 1941, before Stalin named him Armaments Commissar in World War II, is his monument. </p> <p> Russia's slow and uncertain withdrawal of its troops from the three Baltic states is adding new poison to a relationship already polluted by unresolved legacies of Soviet rule. </p> <p> A recent shooting outside a Russian navy depot here, where Russian paratroopers moved in to regain control of a building seized hours before by Estonian troops, has underscored fears that the tensions could veer out of control and lead to even more dangerous incidents. </p> <p> As part of its program to shrink the American nuclear arms industry, the Department of Energy said today that it would immediately scrap its effort to build a new nuclear reactor to produce tritium, a radioactive gas used in atomic bombs. </p> <p> The announcement was made in a letter from Energy Secretary James D. Watkins to Senator Strom Thurmond, the senior Republican lawmaker from South Carolina. The Savannah River Plant, a nuclear arms manufacturing center near Aiken, S.C., was considered the likeliest site for building the new reactor, which would have cost at least $6 billion. </p> <p> Irritated by Moscow's failure to provide information about its secret biological weapons program, the Bush Administration asked Russia today to demonstrate that it has ended the program. </p> <p> Administration officials said they did not question the commitment of the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, to end the manufacture or stockpiling of these weapons. But they said they believed that the political authorities in Moscow were having difficulty getting the Russian military to divulge details about a program that violated the 1972 biological-warfare treaty. </p> <p> The Ukrainian Defense Ministry began like a revolutionary cell, with three officers. In the months after Ukraine's declaration of independence on Aug. 24, 1991, President Leonid M. Kravchuk and the present Defense Minister, Gen. Konstantin Morozov, began a series of quiet visits to Soviet military bases. </p> <p> A sovereign Ukraine would emerge from the collapsing empire, they told senior officers, and an independent army would be central to the new state. Anyone willing to take an oath of allegiance to Ukraine would be guaranteed his job and full pension and other rights, including citizenship. </p> <p> A private group said yesterday that Russia apparently has much more highly enriched uranium than previously thought, leading to serious doubts about whether an agreement to sell such bomb-grade material to the United States will insure the scrapping of nuclear arms. </p> <p> The Natural Resources Defense Council, a private group that tracks nuclear arms, said from its Washington office that the uncertainty showed the importance of verifying weapon dismantlement in arms agreements. </p> <p> A civil war is intensifying in Tajikistan, causing increased alarm in Moscow over some 10,000 Russian troops who are caught in the middle. </p> <p> Russia sent some 800 reinforcements to Dushanbe today, hoping to end continued attacks on barracks and arms depots by combatants looking for weapons. There has also been new nervousness in neighboring Uzbekistan, where President Islam A. Karimov has sealed the border against refugees from the fighting and is increasing controls on his political opposition. </p> <p> Russia is selling diesel submarines to Iran despite protests from Washington, and the first of the vessels is expected to be sent to Iran shortly, senior Pentagon officials said today. </p> <p> The sale worries the United States Navy, which says the Iranian submarines will introduce a new threat to naval operations in the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea, sea lanes for much of the world's oil. </p> <p> In a move that is undercutting efforts to stem the spread of arms, Russia is selling missile-guidance technology, rocket engines and other advanced weapons systems to China, its onetime adversary, American officials say. </p> <p> The exports to Beijing worry Bush Administration officials, who fear that a main reason the Chinese are acquiring the technology is to develop new weapons to sell to the third world. </p> <p> With a decade of negotiations and an era of superpower rivalry gone by, the Senate endorsed an arms control treaty today that sharply reduces the numbers of long-range nuclear weapons held by the United States and four republics of the former Soviet Union. </p> <p> Even greater cuts in nuclear arms are already planned under a later agreement reached last June by President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. That agreement, currently being translated into treaty language, would cut warheads to 3,000 in the Russian arsenal and 3,500 in the American one, less than a third of today's levels. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin issued a decree today suspending the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic states, asserting a "profound concern" over the treatment of Russians there. </p> <p> The decree was certain to provoke a storm in Estonian, Latvia and Lithuania, whose governments view the continuing presence of Russian troops on their territories as the greatest single threat to their security and independence. </p> <p> For many American seamen who sailed the Arctic aboard allied Liberty ships, running a gantlet of German firepower to supply the Russians in World War II, the treacherous Murmansk run still evokes chilling and painful memories. </p> <p> "The first time I heard and saw a German scooper, a German dive bomber, it scared the living bejesus out of me," recalled Joseph Zuvicich, a former merchant marine. In 1942, he made the terrifying 1,600-mile voyage from Scotland to the Soviet port of Murmansk on an oil tanker called the Antietam, which supplied the ships in the convoy. </p> <p> President Bush said today that the United States was ready to use its military forces to impose a ban on combat flights in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a step that could introduce American air power into the Balkan war for the first time. </p> <p> In a written statement issued by the White House, Mr. Bush said he was seeking a United Nations resolution banning all flights in Bosnian airspace except those authorized by the world body. He said Serbian bombing attacks showed a "flagrant disregard for human life."  [ Excerpts, page 5. ] </p> <p> A day after President Boris N. Yeltsin suspended a pullout of Russian troops, the independent Baltic states reacted with anger and dismay today and new questions were raised in the West regarding aid to Moscow and Russia's long-term intentions in the Baltics. </p> <p> A spokesman from NATO headquarters in Brussels urged Russia not to delay the pullout, despite the logistical difficulties of housing returning troops. </p> <p> The newly independent Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania have asked this year's General Assembly to help persuade Russia to remove the troops that remain in the tiny former Soviet states. </p> <p> Saying their negotiations with Russia have so far failed to resolve the issue, diplomats from the three nations have proposed a draft resolution that calls for a swift removal of all Russian soldiers, relics of the Soviet empire that collapsed last year. The resolution is scheduled to come before the General Assembly in the coming weeks unless a sudden breakthrough is achieved. </p> <p> Russian authorities have disclosed the precise sites where four nuclear submarines laden with missiles and torpedoes have sunk as well as the locations near the Arctic island of Novaya Zemlaya where several Russian reactors and other radioactive waste were dumped over the last 30 years. </p> <p> The disclosures are part of Russian-American negotiations on how to monitor the dumped radioactive material and do what is possible to prevent its escape. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia told his top military leaders today that he would keep the total military budget at last year's level, but would increase spending on arms and equipment 10 percent. </p> <p> That plan presumably offered a measure of reassurance to the armed forces, which have been disoriented and demoralized by the collapse of the Soviet Union and a radical drop in military spending. But Mr. Yeltsin also assailed the officers for moving far too slowly in reorganizing and reducing the vast Soviet military machine, and he demanded that they crack down on arms pilferage and corruption. </p> <p> With an eye on the sale of Russian submarines to Iran, the Pentagon has sent a nuclear submarine into the Persian Gulf to examine the acoustic properities of the waters there, senior Pentagon officials said today. </p> <p> The deployment of the Topeka, which passed through the Strait of Hormuz on Sunday, represents the first time that a nuclear-powered American submarine has entered the Persian Gulf. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia asked the United Nations on Friday to "take all measures" within its power to help end what he said were human rights violations against ethnic Russians in the Baltic countries. </p> <p> Last month, Russia suspended the withdrawal of its troops from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania and indicated that the timing of the withdrawal was linked to the treatment of the troops, their families and the ethnic Russian populations in the three countries. </p> <p> Concluding a three-day visit here, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia promised today to put pressure on North Korea to give up its effort to develop nuclear weapons. </p> <p> Speaking at a news conference with President Roh Tae Woo of South Korea, Mr. Yeltsin said Russia had already stopped supplying North Korea with nuclear technology and materials. Without Russian help, he said, North Korea would not be able to develop nuclear arms. </p> <p> Russian scientists sought American financial and technical help earlier this year to raise a nuclear submarine that sank off the coast of Norway in 1989, saying they were afraid it would leak radiation into the Barents Sea, a Defense Department official said today. </p> <p> But the Pentagon, fearing that the submarine might break apart and release radiation as it was lifted out of the water, rebuffed the Russian request, arguing that the submarine was not leaking radiation. Additionally, the Pentagon was concerned that the Russians scientists were not making an official request on behalf of the Russian Government. </p> <p> The Western trade group established to police high-technology sales to Communist countries radically shifted its focus today by opening its doors to its former enemies and urging them to join in controlling sensitive exports to nations threatening global security. </p> <p> The 17-nation Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, held a meeting today that Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Armenia and other successor nations to the former Soviet Union were allowed to attend for the first time. American officials said the message to them was that they would receive increasingly sophisticated Western technology as they provided evidence they had imposed effective export controls. </p> <p> The world may be sitting on top of the next nuclear crisis without even knowing it. That is because at least five Middle Eastern countries -- Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Algeria -- are working to develop nuclear weapons. (Israel already has the bomb.) Like Iraq, they are buying strategic technologies from Western companies. They are also attempting to acquire nuclear materials from the former Soviet Union. </p> <p> The U.S. has not learned the lessons of the Iraq debacle. Half the equipment licensed for sale to Iran by the Commerce Department over the past four years is considered "nuclear weapons relevant" by the Energy Department. Our export control system continues to obey commercial rather than strategic imperatives, despite overwhelming evidence that American technology is being used for weapons programs that could one day be turned against us. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia surprised the White House today by announcing that he was ready to sign a major nuclear-arms treaty that American officials believed was still being negotiated. </p> <p> Unsure whether Mr. Yeltsin was only voicing general support for the treaty, or had in fact agreed to its final details, White House officials scrambled much of the day for an appropriate response. None were willing to confirm Mr. Yeltsin's declaration that the treaty could be signed next month, and one ranking official said the last negotiating session, this week in Stockholm, had ended with no clear agreement. </p> <p> Hopes that the Bush Administration will sign a far-reaching nuclear arms reduction agreement with Russia dimmed today as Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger and Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev failed to bridge technical but important concerns raised by Moscow. </p> <p> In a briefing with reporters after their three-hour meeting, the two officials said that resolution of the differences was still possible in the 37 days remaining in the Bush Administration and suggested that they might meet again on the matter. But neither side was willing to say whether any of the technical demands made by Russia in September had been settled. </p> <p> In a last-ditch push to conclude a nuclear arms treaty before he leaves office next month, President Bush has agreed to compromise on two of the remaining three hurdles to an agreement, Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger said today. </p> <p> Mr. Eagleburger disclosed the Administration's willingness to compromise in remarks to reporters today en route to Geneva, where he will meet on Monday with senior Russian officials. </p> <p> After announcing he will meet with President President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia on Saturday, President Bush began a foreign trip Wednesday to Saudi Arabia, Somalia and Russia on what he called a purely humanitarian -- and not personal -- mission of good will. </p> <p> President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia have agreed to hold a summit meeting in the Black Sea resort of Sochi early in January if an arms control treaty can be completed by then, the White House said today. </p> <p> Mr. Bush called Mr. Yeltsin this morning to discuss the accord. Afterward, a senior Administration official said that Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger would leave Washington on Sunday for a meeting in Geneva with Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev to try to thrash out the remaining differences. </p> <p> In the bad old days of the Soviet Union, a frequent answer to the question "What's going on?" was "Nobody knows." Still, somebody usually knew. But now, in Russia, nobody really does know. Least of all experts in the West. </p> <p> Some obscure older-style bureaucrat named Viktor Chernomyrdin replaces Yegor Gaidar, the West's reformist darling, as Prime Minister. One day President Boris Yeltsin looks like a master democratic strategist; the next day he doesn't seem to have a clue. The Russian Foreign Minister gives a frightening hard-line speech at an important international conference -- then an hour later says it was all a joke. The Russian economy shows promise in places, but mostly it's fallen into a deep depression, ripe for repression. </p> <p> The thousands of Russian troops remaining in the Baltics, on what is now foreign soil, are dispirited and sometimes angry at what they regard as petty harassments and humiliations on the part of the newly independent states. </p> <p> Among Baltic leaders, however, especially in Estonia and Latvia, there is deep suspicion that the Russian military does not want to pull out all its troops, since they serve to put pressure on Baltic nations to allow Russia to continue to use key military and intelligence installations. </p> <p> The United Nations agency that oversees civil aviation decided on Friday to resume its long dormant inquiry into the downing in 1983 of a South Korean airliner by a Soviet fighter. Russian officials have assured the agency that tapes from the plane's flight-data and cockpit voice recorders will be provided for impartial analysis. </p> <p> Analysis of the tapes, which the Russians announced this fall had been recovered within weeks of the downing, could help experts determine why the Boeing 747 strayed deep into Russian airspace on its flight from Alaska to Seoul. All 269 people on board the plane, Korean Air Lines Flight 007, were killed in the incident. </p> <p> In completing a new strategic arms treaty, Washington and Moscow have for the first time agreed to bring their strategic nuclear arsenals into line with their new cooperative relationship. </p> <p> Throughout the cold war, each side amassed an expanding arsenal of strategic weapons. But the agreement will drastically cut the size of each side's arsenal and, most important of all, ban the most threatening type of nuclear weapon -- the land-based missile with multiple warheads. Removing the Hair Trigger </p> <p> Despite the waning of the nuclear threat brought about by the end of the cold war, the agreement on the second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty was not inevitable. And it was a testimony to the difficulty of the Start II negotiations that the final hurdles were not overcome until this week, six months after President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin announced that they had reached a basic agreement on the treaty at a June summit meeting in Washington. </p> <p> The United States and Russia announced agreement today on terms for an ambitious nuclear-arms-reduction treaty, paving the way for a summit meeting as early as this weekend between President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin. </p> <p> Rushing to conclude the agreement before the Bush Administration leaves office, and backed by President-elect Bill Clinton, the United States compromised on three technical but important demands by Russia. Mr. Bush is to meet Mr. Yeltsin in Sochi, a Russian resort city on the Black Sea, on his way back to Washington from Somalia, where he is going on Friday. </p> <p> The United States and Russia continued to talk today about concluding a far-reaching nuclear-arms-reduction agreement and agreed to meet again on Tuesday. Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia offered to bet a bottle of whisky on a positive outcome. </p> <p> Speaking to reporters before a dinner tonight with the Russian delegation, Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger said tersely, "We're making progress." Asked whether he expected to overcome the differences on stubborn technical issues before he is scheduled to leave Geneva on Tuesday, Mr. Eagleburger replied, "We will work as hard as we can." </p> <p> Leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States met today in the Belarus capital, Minsk, for a summit meeting that once again failed to give real shape or purpose to the association that emerged 13 months ago as the successor to the Soviet Union. </p> <p> The meeting, which was delayed three times, ended without resolving a quarrel between the commonwealth's two largest members, Russia and Ukraine, over the control of strategic nuclear weapons. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia declared today that despite opposition from the United States, Moscow remained committed to the supply of powerful rocket engines for India's space program. </p> <p> "We do not plan to backtrack," Mr. Yeltsin said at a news conference here, adding that he would discuss the issue with President Clinton. Mr. Yeltsin said he hoped that the United States would respond with "common sense, sensibility" to the announcement. </p> <p> On the eve of President Bush's arrival here to sign a nuclear arms reduction treaty, President Boris N. Yeltsin is being criticized for pushing through an accord that some say serves American interests and confirms Russia's subordinate status in a post-Communist world. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin, his authority eroded by a bruising battle with the Legislature last month, pressed the White House into a rapid completion of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as Start II. Mr. Bush had let it ride during his election campaign, but both sides were eager to complete the treaty. The terms were approved on Tuesday and the signing will be on Saturday. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia said today that he had offered Ukraine security guarantees against nuclear or conventional attack that would come into effect after Kiev's Parliament ratifies the first strategic arms reduction treaty and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. </p> <p> The offer came in a meeting with the Ukrainian President, Leonid M. Kravchuk, who has promised that Ukraine will become a non-nuclear state within seven years, disposing of the 176 strategic nuclear missiles and other nuclear weapons it inherited after the breakup of the Soviet Union. </p> <p> As President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia prepare to sign a treaty cutting deep into their nuclear arsenals, Ukraine has been tugging at their sleeves with an awkward and unwelcome question: How much will it cost to get rid of weapons of mass destruction, and who is going to foot the bill? </p> <p> The United States has pledged $800 million to help the states of the former Soviet Union cope with the enormous task of dismantling a vast arsenal of chemical, nuclear and biological weapons. But diplomats here say the cost is likely to be considerably greater. </p> <p> In Moscow this week, a Ukrainian diplomat told reporters that the cost to Ukraine alone will be more than $1.5 billion, a sum he called on the international community to pay. Some experts say that Ukraine's hesitations about renouncing its nuclear status are already casting a pall over the new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as Start II, even before it is signed in Moscow this weekend. Lisbon Pacts Await Approval </p> <p> Concerns about costs, but also about Ukrainian security, are the main reasons the Ukrainian Parliament has balked at ratification of arms-reduction agreements reached earlier this year in Lisbon. There, all four of the Soviet Union's successor states with nuclear weapons -- Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus -- agreed to abide by Start I, which made the first step toward cutting nuclear stockpiles. </p> <p> But only Russia and the United States have actually ratified the treaty. The parliaments of the other three republics have so far held off not only formal approval of Start I, but also ratification of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Until its neighbors agree to these accords, Russia has made it clear it will not begin the slow and costly process of eliminating its own nuclear arsenal. </p> <p> Of the three, Ukraine has protested the loudest, calling the attention of both Russia and the West to what it considers the inequities of the financial burden of disarmament. At a news conference in Moscow this week, Ukraine's Ambassador to Russia, Vladimir Kryshanovsky, said the "very complicated, very difficult economic situation in the Ukraine" was one of the obstacles to the Parliament's ratification of Start I and the non-proliferation treaty. </p> <p> Most observers see the Ukrainian inaction as a bargaining tactic, designed to wrest greater pledges from both the West and Russia for assistance in helping convert to a non-nuclear status. But there is also a parliamentary minority that wants to take another look at Ukraine's commitment to renounce nuclear weapons, as a way both of keeping the West's attention and of protecting itself against Russia. </p> <p> The longer Ukraine withholds final approval of Start I and the treaty to halt the spread of nuclear weapons, the longer the shadow it will cast over the agreements to be signed in Moscow this weekend. </p> <p> "If the Ukrainians don't ratify, then it is a show-stopper for both agreements," said one Western diplomat, referring to Start I and Start II. </p> <p> As it is, President Yeltsin is likely to face a tough debate in the Russian Parliament over the ratification of Start II, perceived by some here as favoring the United States. </p> <p> With 176 intercontinental missiles and 16 long-range Backfire bombers based in Ukrainian territory, the republic's participation is crucial to the dismantling of the old Soviet nuclear system. Under the terms of Start I, most of these weapons would be transferred to Russia over the next seven years. The rest would be removed under the non-proliferation pact. Security, Environment, Trade </p> <p> In Kiev this week, Dmytro Pavlychko, head of the Parliament's foreign affairs commission, said he was certain the Parliament would ratify Start I, but not before February. He said the Parliament had three main concerns -- a commitment by nuclear powers to defend Ukraine against aggression, guarantees against environmental damage and the ability to trade directly with buyers of the nuclear material taken from missiles. </p> <p> As it watches Russia sell the plutonium used in nuclear weapons to the United States for cash, Ukraine is seeking compensation for the nuclear material inside the missiles on its territory, either by selling it to Russia, or to the United States directly, or trading it for fuel for nuclear power stations. </p> <p> Given the unknowns surrounding the technology required to dismantle weapons of mass destruction, no hard estimate can be made on how much it will cost either Russia or the United States to neutralize the 18,000 nuclear warheads due to be eliminated under Start I and II. But the sum is expected to be considerable, and the burden is likely to be carried mainly by the United States, diplomats said. </p> <p> "The assumption of the Russians is that this is a continuous process, and clearly there is an American interest involved here in seeing them maintain it," said one Western diplomat. "I think we will be stunned by the costs of taking apart the arsenals built up on both sides." </p> <p> The first installment of the American aid, $165 million, has been earmarked for several specific disarmament projects, including $25 million for a center to monitor the dismantling, $25 million for the disposal of chemical weapons, $50 million for special containers to transport radioactive material and $20 million for special railway cars. </p> <p> The Ukraine has been promised $175 million to help pay for removing and transferring weapons to Russia. </p> <p> Teams of American specialists have already visited Russia several times as advisers on nuclear-dismantling techniques. But several important decisions remain, including whether to build just one center for storage and dismantling, and where the center or centers should be located. </p> <p> With 20 intercontinental missile bases and about 850 multiple-warhead missiles, Russia has by far the largest arsenal of the former Soviet republics. But these bases are widely dispersed within Russia and, unlike American bases, they are not equipped with storage facilities for nuclear warheads. So the removal of the warheads requires that they be transported, often over long distances, and then stored in specially constructed warehouses as they await destruction. </p> <p> -------------------- </p> <p> Talks Set for Washington </p> <p> WASHINGTON, Dec. 31 (Reuters) -- Ukraine is sending a top official to Washington for talks with the Bush Administration and President-elect Clinton's team. </p> <p> Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk will be in the capital Jan. 5-7, a Ukrainian Embassy spokesman, Dimitro Markov, said today. He described Mr. Tarasyuk, chairman of the Ukrainian Government's National Disarmament Committee, as "our top expert on nuclear disarmament, the man authorized by the President to negotiate on all the issues." </p> <p> With a flourish of oratory and a dash of wistfulness, Presidents Bush and Boris N. Yeltsin signed a treaty today calling for the most significant rollback yet in the formidable nuclear arsenal of the cold war. </p> <p> The signing ceremony in the richly embellished St. Vladimir Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace was the centerpiece of a two-day "working visit" that also marked Mr. Bush's last curtain call in the East-West drama that defined so much of his presidency. </p> <p> If nostalgia enveloped George Bush on his 25th and probably final foreign adventure as President, there was also some nostalgia for the old sureties of traditional arms control. </p> <p> Given its very sweep, the second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as Start II, is likely to be the last agreement of its kind. It represents both the triumph and the limit of two-way negotiations on arms control in a world that is no longer bipolar. </p> <p> If nostalgia enveloped George Bush on his 25th and probably final foreign adventure as President, there was also some nostalgia for the old sureties of traditional arms control. </p> <p> Given its very sweep, the second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as Start II, is likely to be the last agreement of its kind.

It represents both the triumph and the limit of two-way negotiations on arms control in a world that is no longer bipolar. </p> <p> As President Bush arrived today in Moscow to sign a sweeping nuclear arms treaty with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, senior Administration officials said the United States, with Mr. Yeltsin's weakened domestic position in mind, had made significant concessions. </p> <p> The officials said the Administration had tried to meet Russian concerns about the military and economic impact of the accord because Mr. Yeltsin may face a difficult fight to get the agreement ratified by the conservative Russian legislature, which recently forced him to abandon his choice for Prime Minister. </p> <p> In what has been hailed as the first attempt to eliminate an entire category of weapons of mass destruction, more than 120 nations, including the United States and Russia, began today to sign an agreement to ban the production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. </p> <p> All such weapons must be destroyed within 10 years of the treaty's entry into force. It further establishes a system of on-site inspections of chemical plants capable of making chemical weapons and contemplates sanctions against countries violating the accord. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin accused the United States today of a tendency to "dictate terms" in places like Iraq and the former Yugoslavia, but he added that President Clinton seemed more inclined to seek dialogue. </p> <p> The comments were Mr. Yeltsin's first explicit expression of dissatisfaction over the latest round of American-led bombings of Iraq, or over Washington's stance on the Balkan conflict. </p> <p> The United States and allies on the United Nations Security Council told Iraq today that it had 48 hours to remove the newly deployed surface-to-air missiles that threaten their planes patrolling the country's southern skies, or face military retaliation. </p> <p> The ultimatum was presented this afternoon to Nizar Hamdoon, the Iraqi representative to the United Nations, by the American, British, Russian and French representatives. </p> <p> Among disarmament negotiators, nuclear missiles are measured by their ability to destroy. In Ukraine, they are increasingly being measured in terms of dollars and respect, and the perception may well hold the key to the success or failure of the strategic arms treaty signed this week in Moscow. </p> <p> "Our deputies don't care where these things are aimed," said Serhiy Holovaty, a leading voice in the Ukrainian Parliament's commission for foreign affairs. "They know that they must get something for them." </p> <p> RUMORS and reported sightings of a secret American superplane have been proliferating lately almost as abundantly as yarns about unidentified flying objects. But despite the acknowledged yearning of many American aviation experts and buffs for an ultrafast spy plane, it appears that development of even the engine needed for such a plane is moving faster in Russia than in this country. </p> <p> The possible existence of a new American intelligence-gathering plane capable of flying at eight times the speed of sound has been suggested in recent articles in the British periodical Jane's Defense Weekly, the American magazine Aviation Week & Space Technology and other respected technical publications. </p> <p> Uneasy at the renewed attacks on a former Soviet ally, Russia urged today that the Security Council be reconvened to consider the tensions in Iraq. </p> <p> A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry reiterated Moscow's contention that Iraq was responsible for the conflict and that the solution was for Baghdad to abide by United Nations decisions. But the statement was muted in its support of the United States air strikes. </p> <p> Allied warplanes renewed their bombing raids against Iraq today as Baghdad continued to challenge enforcement of flight bans over both northern and southern Iraq. </p> <p> The new air strikes were the third in six days. Baghdad said 21 people were killed in the raids today. </p> <p> Struggling to earn hard currency and preserve jobs, Russia and the other republics of the former Soviet Union are selling arms and technology to Iran, China and other countries whose military buildups are causing great concern in the West. </p> <p> The Russian arms exports in particular rankle Washington even though they are down sharply from cold-war days and appear to have little ideological motivation. Critics of the sales also concede that Moscow has extensive control over high-technology arms sales and that it tries to adhere to United Nations arms embargoes. </p> <p> A collision today between an Iran Air passenger jet and a military plane near Teheran Airport killed all 132 people on board the airliner, the official Iranian press agency reported. </p> <p> The airliner, a Tupolev TU-154 chartered from Russia by Iran Air and carrying 119 passengers and 13 Russian crew members, collided with a Sukhoi jet minutes after takeoff, Iran Air officials said. The two-man crew of the Sukhoi ejected to safety before crash and were said to be listed in satisfactory condition, according to the press agency. </p> <p> Lose Yeltsin, lose the peace dividend. From Richard Nixon on down, commentators treat the prospect of higher defense spending as the clinching argument for increasing Western aid to Russia. Secretary of State Warren Christopher made the same case yesterday in his speech before the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations. Yet the pay-me-now-or-pay-me-later choice they and others pose is less hard-boiled analysis than wishful thinking, and it reflects a failure to imagine the immense problems that will flow from the failure of Russian democracy. </p> <p> Increasing the defense budget bought security during the cold war. It will buy much less if things now go wrong in Russia. The real cost we face is not the loss of the peace dividend, but the loss of American pre-eminence. </p> <p> Win or lose, Boris Yeltsin is giving the Russian people the greatest gift that is in him -- to keep the second Russian Revolution alive and block the third. </p> <p> But to win, it is conceivable he will need a show of support from Russia's armed forces. If so, it should be his right to command. The West should remind them it will be their duty to obey. </p> <p> In the latest round of a cat-and-mouse game that has outlived the cold war, an American attack submarine collided on Saturday with a Russian missile-carrying sub in the Arctic Ocean, the Pentagon said today. </p> <p> The collision occurred as the Grayling was shadowing a Russian Delta-class sub, which is normally equipped with 16 ocean-spanning nuclear-tipped missiles. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration is likely to ask Congress to increase direct American aid for Russia next year from the $700 million previously proposed to more than $1 billion, and to direct the assistance to Russian farmers, entrepreneurs and military officers, senior Administration officials said today. </p> <p> Several key lawmakers involved in foreign aid said they would be inclined to go along with the increased spending for Russia if the President is willing to make the case to the American people. </p> <p> Both of Russia's feuding branches of government say they want to avoid involving the army in their dispute, and military leaders say they are happy to oblige. Humiliated, orphaned and starved for funds by the collapse of the Soviet Union, the military is an uncertain instrument even in the hands of its commanders. </p> <p> Military experts, Russian analysts and Western diplomats say that if President Boris N. Yeltsin or the Russian Parliament tries to use the army in this essentially political struggle, it is likely to split, raising the prospects of real civil strife and prolonged chaos. </p> <p> The United States is preparing to pare down the military power created by almost a half-century of American strategy and investment and a national lifetime of industrial growth. </p> <p> Aside from those whose jobs are threatened, most Americans are paying about as much close attention as to the peeling of a banana. </p> <p> The Georgian leadership said today that a Russian aircraft piloted by a Russian major had been shot down over Abkhazia and accused Russia of "undisguised military aggression" in the breakaway region. </p> <p> The conflict between the Tbilisi Government and Abkhazia threatened to expand into an open war between Russia and Georgia. </p> <p> In an effort to bolster President Boris N. Yeltsin's political position, the White House is considering offering him loan guarantees to house demobilized Russian troops and an enterprise fund to support emerging Russian capitalists, senior Administration officials said today. </p> <p> These ideas are being considered as part of what President Clinton said would be "some innovative solutions" for aiding Russia that he will propose to President Yeltsin when the two meet next month, officials said. Mr. Clinton announced today that the meeting would be held in Vancouver, British Columbia, on April 3 and 4. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin softened his emergency measures today, but efforts at compromise with the legislature faltered and the full Congress of People's Deputies was summoned for Friday to take up the question of removing him from office. </p> <p> Hopes for a political settlement rose in the early afternoon when the four top officials of the Russian federation -- Mr. Yeltsin; the chairman of the Congress, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov; the chairman of the Constitutional Court, Valery D. Zorkin, and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin -- agreed to meet. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration said today that Russia had agreed to send military transport planes to join the airdrop of relief supplies to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and that nine other countries had offered to donate food and medicine. </p> <p> Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev, speaking in Moscow after meeting with Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France, said the Russian operation could begin "pretty quickly" after technical questions like guaranteeing the security of Russian aircraft had been resolved. Russia has been an ally of Serbia in the past. </p> <p> The political unrest in Russia has stalled efforts to substantially reduce nuclear arsenals in the United States and the former Soviet Union. </p> <p> In Ukraine, new fears of Russian nationalism have encouraged an increasingly vocal group of legislators who advocate keeping some nuclear weapons. President Leonid Kravchuk had promised last year that Ukraine would ratify not only the 1991 Soviet-American agreement reducing nuclear warheads, but also the non-proliferation treaty of 1970, which would oblige it to give up all nuclear weapons.  Treaties Need One Another </p> <p> The breakup of the Soviet Union left nuclear weapons in four republics: Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. All but Ukraine have ratified the July 1991 treaty, which called for one-third cuts in the nuclear warheads on Soviet and American ballistic missiles, and Ukrainian legislators, who are debating the treaty, are hesitant about giving up the weapons they inherited from the Soviet Union. </p> <p> A program to use $800 million in American funds to help dismantle Russia's nuclear weapons has bogged down over chaos within Russia, Moscow's lingering obsession with secrecy and its determination to make as much money as it can on the nuclear materials that the country is giving up, a Senate committee was told today. </p> <p> Sixteen months ago, Congress authorized the first half of the $800 million, but only $25 million has been spent. A total of $303 million has been committed to particular projects, but much of that is contingent on decisions by Russia or the other three former Soviet states that have nuclear weapons -- Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. </p> <p> A shaken Russian Parliament resolved today to take President Boris N. Yeltsin to the Constitutional Court, but the angry legislators stopped short of directly moving against the President or trying to block the emergency powers he claimed against them on Saturday. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin did not attend the session. The evening television news program said that his mother had died at 84 and that he had gone home to Yekaterinburg. </p> <p> In an effort to support President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and his democratic reform movement, President Clinton is to meet with Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia in Washington next week, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said today. </p> <p> The meeting comes as the Administration is struggling, in the absence of major new financing, to put together a package of small-scale incentives to promote Russia's economic and political reform movement before the Clinton-Yeltsin meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia, on April 3 and 4. </p> <p> Several weeks ago, international inspectors showed North Korean officials American surveillance photographs and chemical evidence laying bare an elaborate effort to deceive the inspectors about how much nuclear-bomb fuel the country has produced. </p> <p> That was their last encounter before North Korea's surprise announcement today that it would become the first country to pull out of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. </p> <p> Fighting back against an opposition that showed him little mercy last week, President Boris N. Yeltsin reached tonight for his last, and perhaps only, weapon: a direct appeal to an exhausted people to place their trust in him once again. </p> <p> In effect, Russia's President is seeking to overturn the country's feeble and flawed constitutional system by popular mandate, rather than with tanks. But for all its boldness, the President's gamble only revealed the weakness of his position, setting the stage for a conflict that promises to extend far beyond the walls of the Kremlin. </p> <p> Declaring it his duty "as a citizen, as a patriot and as a decent man," President Boris N. Yeltsin today assumed virtually unlimited powers and ordered national balloting to decide how and by whom Russia is to be governed. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin's dramatic appeal to the nation in a televised address plunged the country into an immediate crisis. </p> <p> Vietnam's senior diplomat dealing with United States affairs today described as a "clear fabrication" a document suggesting that 1,205 American prisoners of war were in North Vietnamese prisons in 1972, more than double the number eventually released. </p> <p> The diplomat, Nguyen Xuan Phong, acting director of the Americas Department at the Foreign Ministry, said in a telephone interview from Hanoi that "we have very strong evidence" to prove "this document is not authentic -- a clear fabrication." </p> <p> The White House promised today that a Presidential envoy would press Vietnam next week for an explanation of a previously secret document suggesting that Hanoi held 1,205 United States prisoners of war in 1972, three times more than it admitted then or later. </p> <p> The document, found in January by an American researcher in the archives of the Soviet Communist Party in Moscow, could prove politically explosive if it is authentic, because it suggests that more than 600 American prisoners were killed, died of natural causes or remain in Vietnamese hands. </p> <p> As President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia began their first summit meeting today, Mr. Clinton presented the Russian leader with some $1 billion in American aid programs intended to support Russian democrats and spur the Western allies to make Russian reform their top foreign policy priority. </p> <p> Among the new or expanded programs in the package were loan guarantees to build apartments for demobilized Russian soldiers; loans for Russian entrepreneurs; medical supplies, food and grain assistance; funds to help the Russian Government sell state-owned industries, and technical advisers to help repair pipelines and oil wells and begin exporting again. </p> <p> The Russian chairman of a joint United States-Russian commission on American P.O.W.'s said today that he was convinced that a report that counted 1,205 American prisoners of war in Vietnam in 1972 was a genuine document from the archives of the Soviet Communist Party. </p> <p> But he added that he could not vouch for the veracity of the information in the report. </p> <p> As a vast European tragedy unfolds a tragedy unprecedented in 50 years -- where is the Western political leadership that will halt this slaughter of the innocents? </p> <p> Sanctions have not persuaded the Serbians to accept the Vance-Owen peace plan and honor a cease-fire. The case for Western intervention in Bosnia has become overwhelming. Margaret Thatcher may have been emotional in calling for military intervention against Serbians. But she struck a chord with millions. </p> <p> Behind Western Europe's reluctance to agree to air strikes or ground operations to halt Serbian attacks against Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the fear, expressed today by the European Community's peace negotiator, Lord Owen, of becoming involved in somebody else's civil war. </p> <p> "Europe must not become combatants in a civil war," Lord Owen said in an interview. "It will be very difficult for the Europeans to take American suggestions of military action seriously until your forces are also on the ground as peacekeepers." </p> <p> In an effort to minimize the chances of a clash with Serbian forces, NATO planes policing the no-flight zone over Bosnia have been instructed to refrain from firing on Serbian aircraft that violate the ban, except as a last resort. </p> <p> The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is to begin enforcing the zone on Monday. But NATO's rules of engagement stand in sharp contrast to the aggressive enforcement of the air-exclusion zones over northern and southern Iraq by the United States and its British and French allies. </p> <p> With the cold war won and gone, you thought you had heard the last of pols and policy experts using the Moscow menace to justify excessive military spending. Think again. </p> <p> Many in Washington are now arguing that if Russian hard-liners topple President Yeltsin, they'll unearth their old military Frankenstein, quickly charge him up and dispatch him once again to terrorize the world. </p> <p> Seeking a new path to East-West disarmament, Russian and American experts have agreed to team up to develop and build a new type of reactor that can burn plutonium from nuclear warheads and turn the deadly bomb fuel into electricity. The $1.5 billion nuclear reactor would be built in Russia and fueled at least partly by plutonium from Moscow's huge stockpile of scrapped nuclear arms. </p> <p> The initiative, led by General Atomics of San Diego, requires up to $100 million over five years from the American Government, which is studying the general idea of burning plutonium and, separately, whether to support the East-West reactor plan. The small reactor would be cooled by helium and is advertised as immune to meltdown. </p> <p> Just three days before a referendum on Boris N. Yeltsin's performance as Russia's President, Russia's top law enforcement officer today accused Mr. Yeltsin's Defense Minister of involvement in the illegal sale of military property in the former East Germany. </p> <p> The charges against Gen. Pavel S. Grachev were made by Valentin G. Stepankov, the Procurator General of Russia, whose job is roughly that of an attorney general in the United States. They came only days after Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, who has broken with Mr. Yeltsin, accused various Yeltsin officials of corruption. </p> <p> Resuming what has become a personal battle to save the besieged Muslim enclave of Srebrenica, the French commander of the United Nations forces in Bosnia today set out by road from Sarajevo in an attempt to return to the town before it is overrun by Serbian nationalist troops. </p> <p> "I have to go back," the commander, Lieut. Gen. Philippe Morillon, told aides after receiving a radio report indicating that Serbian attacks on the town were increasing despite Serbian promises to observe a cease-fire and to allow United Nations convoys of food and medicine into the town. </p> <p> When an American President enters a war, widens a war or prolongs a war, it becomes his war. </p> <p> It makes no difference who started it. Japan, North Korea and Iraq started wars that became the center of life and office for Presidents Roosevelt, Truman and Bush. Neither Presidents Johnson nor Nixon started the war in Vietnam but it became theirs from the moment of their oaths. </p> <p> Under preliminary plans being drawn up by NATO military authorities, American and allied peacekeeping forces are to sweep into Sarajevo and other key Bosnian cities before fanning out into the Bosnian countryside to police a new peace accord. </p> <p> The initial troops sent to Sarajevo would be the vanguard of a force of more than 50,000, which is to include about 20,000 to 25,000 American troops, according to Western diplomats and military officials. Other European officials said that the United States has advised NATO that it is prepared eventually to contribute up to 34,000 troops. </p> <p> THE top nuclear weapon designers of East and West, who for decades labored in secret to devise better ways of destroying each other's homelands with radioactive fire, are teaming up to conduct a joint scientific experiment for the first time. </p> <p> The collaboration in basic science, to begin this summer, is seen as a post-cold-war milestone. While many East-West partnerships have formed since the collapse of the Soviet Union, including a few among scientists with atomic skills, no experimental work has yet involved the highly specialized researchers who usually devote themselves to devising new kinds of nuclear armaments. </p> <p> A day after President Clinton said he expected to produce "a common approach" with Europe soon on stronger action in Bosnia, Washington and its allies were increasingly at odds today over precisely what the next steps should be. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration, officials said, would like to move ahead quickly with some form of military action that could pressure the Bosnian Serbs to accept the peace settlement. But Secretary of State Warren Christopher reported to President Clinton today that the Europeans -- particularly Russia -- wanted to wait and see if a Bosnian Serb referendum scheduled for May 15 and 16 resulted in a vote in favor of the settlement. This might spare the Europeans -- and the United States -- from having to take any military action. </p> <p> President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine asked President Boris N. Yeltsin today for a meeting soon to resolve a growing and dangerous dispute over the former Soviet Black Sea Fleet. </p> <p> Mr. Kravchuk's appeal followed a formal Ukrainian protest on Saturday after some 80 percent of the ships -- though no warships -- raised the Russian naval flag in a rolling dispute over pay and allegiance. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration is now telling the Europeans it is willing to use air power to protect United Nations peacekeeping forces guarding safe havens for Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina. But President Clinton reiterated his opposition to any American soldiers participating on the ground while the war continues, even as part of the peacekeeping effort. </p> <p> Secretary of State Warren Christopher informed the Europeans of the shift in the American position in meetings with Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia on Thursday and with Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain today, senior European officials said. The shift is also reflected in a draft statement of principles, written by Mr. Christopher as a basis for an anticipated joint announcement by the allies, the officials said. </p> <p> Insisting that the President of Serbia still backed the international peace plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina despite its rejection by Bosnian Serbs, Russia's Foreign Minister said today that he hoped the United States would yet agree to a Security Council meeting to carry out the plan. </p> <p> The Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, met with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia here after seeing the Croatian President, Franjo Tudjman, in the Adriatic resort of Split. Mr. Kozyrev said that the Croatian leader agreed to accept an international monitoring force along the Croatian-Bosnian border. </p> <p> Russian scientists have issued their most dire warning yet on the threat posed by the nuclear submarine Komsomolets, which sank in the North Atlantic off Norway four years ago. They warned that in the next few years plutonium from its nuclear warheads could leak, spread more than 60 miles and possibly poison major fishing grounds. </p> <p> Western scientists discounted the new estimate yesterday, saying the Russians were fanning public apprehension in an attempt to raise money for a proposed cleanup of the cold-war relic, which lies some 300 miles off the Norwegian coast in waters more than a mile deep. </p> <p> After months of discord and vacillation, the United States, Russia and key European allies agreed today on a joint strategy devised to contain the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to guard enclaves of Muslim civilians besieged by Serbian nationalists there. </p> <p> The plan, announced by Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the Foreign Ministers of France, Britain, Russia and Spain after a brief meeting here, calls for the United States to use air power if necessary to protect United Nations peacekeepers guarding six Bosnian towns that have been designated "safe havens" by the United Nations Security Council. Issue Goes to Security Council </p> <p> But the size and duties of the peacekeeping mission will have to be decided by the Security Council, and Mr. Christopher did not specify what American aircraft would be authorized to do. That means that no use of American military force is imminent. </p> <p> Despite the apparent lack of progress in a week of diplomatic consultations, President Clinton said today that he expected to produce "a common approach" with Europe soon on a strategy to bring the Bosnian Serbs to the peace table. </p> <p> "There's still some disagreement around the edges about what the overall specific tactical steps should be," Mr. Clinton told reporters after a meeting at the White House with representatives of the European Community. "But I think there's a lot more agreement than you think, and I think in the next few days we'll see a common approach emerging." </p> <p> Angry and feeling betrayed by an American, Russian and European strategy aimed at curbing the fighting in this war-ravaged country, Bosnia's Muslim President today rejected the plan as "absolutely unacceptable." </p> <p> The plan, announced in Washington on Saturday, effectively rules out international military intervention for the time being against the Bosnian Serbs, who control 70 percent of the country. </p> <p> The Security Council plans to approve the modest new Western strategy for containing the war in Bosnia this week, but diplomats said today that the vote would not remove obstacles like an inadequate number of peacekeeping troops or resistance from Serbs and Muslims. </p> <p> The Council plans to adopt three resolutions endorsing the "step by step" approach to curbing the fighting, which was hammered out by the United States, Russia and key European allies on Saturday after months of indecision and discord. </p> <p> Taking its most visible international role since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia is trying to fill the policy vacuum left by President Clinton's decision to yield to European opposition and shelve his plan to bomb the Serbs and arm the Bosnian Muslims. </p> <p> The Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, after a tour of Europe and the Balkans to try to organize support for a new Russian initiative, will meet Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Thursday in Washington. Mr. Kozyrev wants to begin carrying out the Vance-Owen peace plan despite formal Bosnian Serb opposition, an approach that has brought skepticism from Washington. </p> <p> As part of its campaign to forge a new relationship with the West, Russia promised today to contribute troops to an international peacekeeping force in Bosnia and Herzegovina if a peace agreement goes into effect there. </p> <p> [ Moscow made the commitment just hours before the Bosnian Serbs' assembly voted early Thursday to reject the plan offered by United Nations and European Community mediators. ] </p> <p> Even as the Bosnian Serbs debated the peace plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina, the United States and the United Nations were at odds today over who would control the troops enforcing it. </p> <p> For the moment, the matter is moot, because the assembly of Bosnia Serbs voted late tonight -- early Thursday morning in Bosnia -- to reject the peace plan. </p> <p> With a Congressional moratorium on nuclear testing due to expire on July 1, President Clinton is expected to approve a plan that would allow underground blasts to resume by the end of the year, Administration officials said today. </p> <p> But the officials said Mr. Clinton was likely to emphasize that he intended to call a final halt to the testing in 1996. </p> <p> With rare unanimity, the European allies reacted with approval today to the United States missile strike against Iraq. </p> <p> Britain, Italy and Germany, all of whose leaders were apparently informed about the plans shortly before the strike began, all gave strong backing to the move today despite reports of civilian casualties. </p> <p> In a blunt expression of differences between Russia and the United States over policy toward nuclear weapons in Ukraine, the Russian Defense Minister, Gen. Pavel S. Grachev, today criticized an American plan to place Ukraine's warheads under international control. </p> <p> Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Defense Secretary Les Aspin in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, General Grachev said the nuclear warheads left in Ukraine after the breakup of the Soviet Union were Russian and should remain under Russian control. </p> <p> Concerned about instability along Russia's southern frontier, Russian military officials have told the Clinton Administration that they would like to revise the treaty limiting conventional forces in Europe so they can put more forces in the region. </p> <p> The Russian request was conveyed to Defense Secretary Les Aspin by Gen. Pavel E. Grachev, the Russian Defense Minister, when they met this week in Germany. But a senior Administration official said Washington was not interested in reopening the treaty, fearing that such a move might lead to a general unraveling of the accord. </p> <p> Ukraine's Defense Minister endorsed an American plan today to put the nuclear warheads based there under international control, pending their elimination. </p> <p> Gen. Konstantin Morozov said that he had a "positive attitude" toward the proposal, which was presented by Defense Secretary Les Aspin as part of a broad plan to defuse tensions between Russia and Ukraine and convince Kievthere is no need to rely on nuclear weapons. </p> <p> After years of silence, Russia has acknowledged that one of the boldest American spy missions of the cold war succeeded in recovering two nuclear warheads from a Soviet submarine that had exploded and sunk in Pacific waters more than three miles deep. </p> <p> It is the first time Russia has said that the West captured any of its nuclear arms. </p> <p> The warheads were recovered in 1974 by an American vessel, the Glomar Explorer, a panel of Russian scientists said in a report to President Boris N. Yeltsin. </p> <p> Despite requests from Britain and France, Russia declined today to commit troops to the United Nations peacekeeping force that is to defend six "safe havens" for the beleaguered Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina. </p> <p> In recent weeks, the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, has indicated that Russia would be willing to send more troops as peacekeepers to the Balkans, a pledge he reiterated today. "We will be prepared to send additional peacekeepers," he told reporters before meeting with Secretary of State Warren Christopher. </p> <p> Meeting with President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine at a country house outside Moscow, President Boris N. Yeltsin today confirmed Russia's willingness to give Ukraine security guarantees. </p> <p> The guarantees would come as the Ukrainian Parliament considers ratification of the first strategic arms treaty, known as Start I, and a related vote on the country's non-nuclear status. </p> <p> Stepping up the American campaign to persuade the Ukrainians to give up their nuclear weapons, Defense Secretary Les Aspin came here today to discuss with Russia a new plan to dismantle Ukraine's nuclear missiles and place their warheads under international supervision. </p> <p> Mr. Aspin met with the Russian Defense Minister, Gen. Pavel S. Grachev. The plan is intended to resolve a Russian-Ukrainian dispute on how to deal with the warheads that would be removed from Ukraine's missiles if Ukraine gave up its nuclear arms. </p> <p> Arms sales to the third world last year fell to their lowest levels since at least 1985, primarily because Russia's sales hit record lows, the Congressional Research Service reported today. </p> <p> Sales from Russia to the third world plummeted to $1.3 billion. Sales from the Soviet Union were $5.9 billion in 1991, and reached a high of $28.8 billion in 1986. Russia was by far the largest arms producer and exporter of the Soviet republics. </p> <p> India said today that it would develop powerful rocket technology that it says it has been denied as a result of an accord between Washington and Moscow. </p> <p> "The Government of India will not allow any setback to India's space technology and space program," the Foreign Office said in an official statement. </p> <p> American and Russian negotiators are close to a compromise in a bitter rift over the Russian sale of missile technology to India in violation of international export controls, senior State Department officials said today. </p> <p> The two sides remained locked in intense discussions tonight in an effort to avoid the automatic imposition of American sanctions against Russian and Indian companies involved in the deal. The sanctions were scheduled to go into effect at midnight, but senior officials said that they were close to a settlement and that discussions would likely continue on Friday. </p> <p> The Russian Parliament recessed for the summer today after rushing through an extraordinary string of measures. If put into force, they threaten to disrupt the economy, undermine the turning over of public property to private interests, fracture relations with Ukraine, jail a key Yeltsin aide and, among many other things, expand the privileges of the legislators. </p> <p> The long list ranges from a budget that is twice as large as anticipated revenues to little-noticed actions like closing K.G.B. archives for an extra 20 years. It includes a declaration claiming the Crimean port of Sevastopol to be Russian, not Ukrainian -- and another condemning the United Nations Security Council for denouncing the measure. </p> <p> The first to protest were scientists at two top-secret Russian nuclear weapons centers who called thousands of their colleagues into the streets to draw the Government's attention to their demands for a living wage. </p> <p> In short order, the complaints were echoed by rectors of Russia's institutions of higher education and by a union representing researchers connected to the Russian Academy of Sciences. The protests struck a common note: Russia's formidable scientific and academic elite is rapidly losing ground financially, and is deeply anxious about its future. </p> <p> The marching melody of "Moscow Nights" blared from ships docked at harborside here as young sailors hoisted and then saluted the pale-blue-and-white naval ensigns, emblems of the Russian czars. The early morning ceremony on support vessels of the Black Sea Fleet appeared routine enough. </p> <p> But the raising of Russian flags on ships berthed in Ukrainian territory has become a symbol of one of the most provocative issues in the volatile relationship between the two strongest and most competitive countries of the old Soviet Union, Russia and Ukraine. </p> <p> The Russian Parliament passed a resolution today declaring the Crimean port city of Sevastopol, which is within Ukraine, to be a Russian city. </p> <p> The resolution was not likely to have much impact, since Ukraine has no intention of ceding Sevastopol and President Boris N. Yeltsin, who is in Tokyo attending the Group of Seven meeting, is unlikely to try to enforce it. </p> <p> Under pressure from the United States, Russia agreed today to halt its planned sale of equipment and technology to India that American experts said could be used to make a ballistic missile, the State Department announced today. </p> <p> In a compromise that ended a bitter year-long dispute, the United States won Russian approval for the halt of the sale in return for waiving economic sanctions that had been set to go into effect today against two Russian companies involved in the deal. </p> <p> A team of Russian, American, Norwegian and Dutch scientists has set sail from Denmark to investigate whether two nuclear warheads aboard a sunken Soviet submarine are leaking plutonium into the rich fishing grounds of the North Atlantic. </p> <p> The monthlong expedition, which left Copenhagen on Thursday aboard a Russian research ship, is the first big East-West effort to examine the submarine Komsomolets, which sank 300 miles off the coast of Norway in 1989. </p> <p> Russian officials reacted calmly today, with only a touch of nationalist bravado, after President Algirdas Brazauskas of Lithuania canceled a visit to Moscow. Mr. Brazauskas announced the cancellation Sunday in a modulated protest over Russia's decision to suspend talks on withdrawing its last 2,500 troops from Lithuania. </p> <p> Russia, scheduled to pull out the last of those troops by Aug. 31, now says it will withdraw the troops "at a time convenient to the Russian Federation." </p> <p> President Clinton's national security aides have recommended that the United States adopt a more assertive role in United Nations peacekeeping operations, Administration officials said tonight. </p> <p> The recommendation, in a classified draft of a Presidential directive, also calls for Washington to take a more active diplomatic role in seeking to resolve disputes within and among the former Soviet republics, the officials said. The recommendations were first reported by The Washington Post and confirmed later by the officials. </p> <p> Until 1988, the last year this resort city had anything like a tourist season, Sukhumi was known as one of the most beautiful spots on the Black Sea coast, with seaside hotels and cafes, palm trees, oleander bushes and turn-of-the-century buildings that gave it a faint hint of elegance. </p> <p> Now, Sukhumi -- the prize in an ugly, yearlong war between Georgia and the breakaway region of Abkhazia -- is a city half in ruins, whose few remaining residents joke bitterly about renting their houses out as sets for war movies. Bone-thin dogs sniff around the blackened rubble, and old men in their pajamas sit in the shade outside their gutted apartments, sharing a smoke with younger menwho have Kalashnikov rifles slung over their shoulders. </p> <p> At an unusual meeting today, President Boris N. Yeltsin appealed to Central Asian leaders to help defend the old Soviet border with Afghanistan against incursions stemming from the civil war in Tajikistan, a former Soviet republic. </p> <p> Russian soldiers have been dying again in battles with Afghans on the mountainous border of Tajikistan, which has brought back some old nightmares here. </p> <p> When President Clinton returns to Washington on Sunday from his vacation, he is expected to approve a Presidential directive that would set out the United States' policy toward peacekeeping in the former Soviet Union, beset by ethnic and nationalist strife. </p> <p> But this attempt by the United States to clarify its role in keeping the peace in the post-cold-war world has had unintended consequences, prompting an angry reaction among Russians opposed to President Boris N. Yeltsin. </p> <p> After a brief dispute last week, Russia and Lithuania announced today that Russia would complete the withdrawal of its remaining 2,500 troops from the Baltic nation "in the nearest future," perhaps as soon as Tuesday. </p> <p> President Algirdas Brazauskas of Lithuania said in a national radio address today that he had agreed in a telephone conversation with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia to keep to the original schedule for withdrawal and to postpone negotiations on any compensation. </p> <p> Enzo G. Castellari, a director of 36 films, including spaghetti westerns of the kind that made Clint Eastwood famous, is beside himself with rapture. After all those years, he sighs, and on a Russian army base of all places, he finally has a Wild West village of his own. </p> <p> "Before, I always had one used in a thousand other films," he said. "It was always somebody else's design, Sergio Leone's or somebody. But at last," he continued, gesturing expansively around the muddy streets and raw lumber buildings marked Feed and Grain and Saloon, "at last, this is my village, this one's mine, the design, the details." </p> <p> The danger of a rift within the Russian military makes it unlikely that supporters of President Boris N. Yeltsin will ask the armed forces to intervene in his current struggle with Parliament, Russian military experts and Western diplomats say. </p> <p> For now, even a military that is neutral appears sufficient to help Mr. Yeltsin, who says he has no intention of using force to subdue the Parliament. But Russian scholars and Western diplomats said that Mr. Yeltsin's restraint could also reflect concern about the risk of an open battle for their loyalty. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin received crucial pledges of support today from leaders of Russia's military and police forces, while opposition members of Parliament issued a stream of defiant resolutions against them. </p> <p> There was no change in the basic situation since the startling developments of Tuesday, when Mr. Yeltsin ordered the disbanding of the Supreme Soviet, or Parliament, which includes many Communists and nationalists opposed to Mr. Yeltsin's policies. </p> <p> Ihor Volokhov is both a successful and a deeply disappointed man. He has a private shop with his wife that sells imported tea, coffee, lingerie, clothes and even wallpaper. He says he's working hard but living decently. </p> <p> But as for an independent Ukraine, he says, "I think it was a mistake." </p> <p> As shells fell almost constantly, the Georgian leader, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, made a desperate appeal today for immediate international help to stop an offensive by Abkhazian separatists on this encircled city in western Georgia. </p> <p> Mr. Shevardnadze, who spent the day here trying to organize Sukhumi's defense, said: "I am appealing to you from Sukhumi, not knowing if my words will ever reach you. </p> <p> Formally ending decades of cold war rivalry in space, the United States and Russia agreed today to merge the hearts of their manned space programs, embarking on a joint effort to design and construct an international space station. </p> <p> In a separate agreement signed today by Vice President Al Gore and Prime Minister Victor S. Chernomyrdin, Russia also agreed to place export controls on missile technology, a step the Administration had set as a condition to cooperation in space. </p> <p> A new Russian document suggesting that Vietnam held more American prisoners of war than it acknowledged has been turned over to American authorities in Moscow. </p> <p> The Pentagon released a translation of an account of a Vietnamese Communist Party meeting held in late 1970 or early 1971, quoting a Vietnamese official, Khoang Anya, as saying Vietnam held 735 "American aviator P.O.W.'s" although it had only given out the names of 368. </p> <p> American and Russian army divisions, which faced each other during the tense days of the cold war, will conduct joint peacekeeping exercises under an agreement the two countries signed today. </p> <p> The peacekeeping exercises, in both countries and in Europe, will involve the Third Infantry Division based in Frankfurt, Germany, and the 27th Motorized Rifle Division from the Volga District in Russia. </p> <p> His hopes for military help dashed by President Clinton, President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia turned his efforts today to soliciting Congressional support for American participation in a multinational peacekeeping force that would oversee the partition of his country if a peace accord is reached by its warring factions. </p> <p> In a meeting with members of Congress, Mr. Izetbegovic urged that the United States contribute a significant number of ground troops to such a force; that troops from Russia, a traditional ally of Serbs, be excluded, and that the commander of the Sarajevo region be an American. </p> <p> Declaring that the "irreconcilable opposition" of the Russian legislature, with its large number of Communists, had paralyzed his reforms and his ability to govern, President Boris N. Yeltsin ordered the group dissolved on Tuesday and called elections to a new parliament for December. </p> <p> Almost immediately, the Supreme Soviet voted by an overwhelming margin to depose Mr. Yeltsin and ordered security forces not to obey him. </p> <p> Six months ago, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia threatened to declare presidential rule to break the power of the holdover Parliament and Soviet-era Constitution. But cautious, even hesitant about the breadth of his support, Mr. Yeltsin pulled back from the brink, from the whole racked and bloody history of single-man rule in Russia. He was nearly impeached for his pains. </p> <p> Tonight, after months of increasing political paralysis, an ever-weakening central authority and economic disarray, Mr. Yeltsin finally rolled the dice he had been juggling for so long. He declared presidential rule, ordered Parliament disbanded and called new elections for early December. </p> <p> Faced with a deepening economic crisis and a heavy debt to Russia for oil and gas, President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine agreed today to let Russia buy Ukraine's share of the disputed Black Sea Fleet, and to dismantle the nuclear weapons remaining on Ukrainian territory, in return for the uranium extracted from their warheads. </p> <p> Mr. Kravchuk's agreement with President Boris N. Yeltsin marked a sharp rollback in Ukraine's ambitions for equal status with its giant and powerful neighbor. But the accords need to be approved by both the Russian and Ukrainian Parliaments, and such action is not necessarily preordained. </p> <p> Only hours after the last unit of Russian soldiers left Lithuania on Tuesday night, jubilant Government officials began giving their friends new stickers they had privately printed. The stickers carry the national coat of arms and the legend: "Lithuania, Free of Foreign Troops." </p> <p> The nation breathed a collective sigh of relief when the long train laden with Russian soldiers and weapons finally left Lithuanian soil. People here had been praying for this moment for more than half a century, many without believing it would ever come. </p> <p> Russian officials said last week that Moscow had decided to seal two corroding nuclear torpedoes aboard a sunken submarine next year to avoid the risk that plutonium might leak and poison fishing grounds in the North Atlantic. </p> <p> The Russians' view of the threat is at odds with assessments by Western scientists who sailed last month on a joint East-West expedition to the Russian submarine, the Komsomolets. They concluded that any radioactivity would lie on the sea floor near the vessel, rather than being swept toward fisheries, because currents around the hulk were found to be weaker than previously believed. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia declared today that resistance by lawmakers isolated in the darkened and encircled Parliament building was "on its last gasp," while leaders of the opposition there issued defiant appeals for mass resistance. </p> <p> As Mr. Yeltsin's bid to disband the Congress of People's Deputies went into its fifth night, the scene grew more menacing at the monumental White House, as the riverfront headquarters of Parliament is known. </p> <p> A top Russian official says Moscow's nuclear arsenal peaked seven years ago at 45,000 warheads -- 12,000 more than generally believed and twice the number held by the United States at the time. The totalexceeded all estimates save those of the most hawkish analysts. </p> <p> The official, Viktor N. Mikhailov, head of the Ministry of Atomic Energy, also says the Russian stockpile of highly enriched uranium is more than twice as large as commonly believed. Uranium in this form is a principal component of most nuclear weapons. </p> <p> In the night before the final and fateful assault on the Parliament center, both the White House and the Kremlin, the headquarters of competing claims to Russia's power a scant three miles apart, seemed caught in illusion and indecision. </p> <p> In the Kremlin, a sparse weekend staff seemed to be caught entirely off guard by the eruption of an armed insurgency on Sunday led by extremists. President Boris N. Yeltsin flew in by helicopter only shortly before 7 P.M., when the cordon around the White House, as the Parliament building is known, was already breached and gunmen were setting off to attack the headquarters of the state television. </p> <p> A Russian naval ship dumped hundreds of tons of low-level nuclear waste into the the Sea of Japan over the weekend, touching off a sharp diplomatic dispute between Tokyo and Moscow today just after they had declared a new era of cooperation. </p> <p> Dumping radioactive materials into the ocean has been banned worldwide for more than 30 years, and a decade ago the prohibition was extended to low-level waste. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin ordered tanks and armored personnel carriers early today to oust armed rebels from their heavily fortified Parliament center, and heavy gunfire echoed through the city as the final showdown opened between the President and his unyielding Communist and nationalist foes. </p> <p> The attack followed a day of pitched battles in the Russian capital on Sunday between thousands of Communist and nationalist opponents of the President who broke the 11-day blockade of the Parliament and attempted to seize the Government broadcasting center. Mr. Yeltsin declared a state of emergency in the capital. </p> <p> SEPT. 21 -- President Boris N. Yeltsin dissolves Parliament and calls new elections for December. Lawmakers vote to impeach him and appoint Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi as Acting President. Anti-Yeltsin demonstrators barricade themselves inside Parliament building. </p> <p> SEPT. 22 -- Military and police forces stick with Yeltsin. Downtown crowds cheer the President. Lawmakers' calls for a nationwide strike go unheeded. </p> <p> President Clinton today blamed opponents of Boris N. Yeltsin for the violence in Moscow and vowed that the United States would not waver in its backing for the Russian President as he sought to restore order. </p> <p> A senior American official described events in Moscow as "a very, very serious crisis." But as the 13-day-old standoff lurched into the streets, Mr. Clinton made clear he had no intention of lessening his support for Mr. Yeltsin. </p> <p> As anti-Yeltsin demonstrators marched on the television headquarters on Sunday, Lidiya Naumovna watched in quiet disbelief. </p> <p> "My heart is pounding," the 52-year-old engineer said as opponents of President Boris N. Yeltsin moved along the Garden Ring road. "Something really horrible is happening." </p> <p> For months now, as Moscow's political warriors have been locked in an increasingly vicious battle for power, each side has accused the other of pushing the country to civil war. Until Sunday, the threat always seemed idle, even in the days since President Boris N. Yeltsin disbanded Parliament and ringed its headquarters with troops. </p> <p> Like a deadly delayed reaction, the violence that swept Moscow on Sunday had been a long time in building. But even as armed mobs were breaking police lines, storming government buildings, and brandishing the red hammer-and-sickle, news of what was happening spread slowly. </p> <p> Secretary of State Warren Christopher used a visit to this medieval port city today to press Moscow to withdraw its Soviet-era troops. </p> <p> After meetings with Latvian leaders and the Foreign Ministers of Estonia and Lithuania, Mr. Christopher said at a news conference that the United States wanted an "early, unconditional and rapid withdrawal" of all Russian troops from Latvian and Estonian soil. </p> <p> Once it was the Evil Empire. Now it's the Magic Kingdom. As if Russia's problems weren't depressing enough, the country's desperate cash hunger has caused it to turn its vast and impressive military enterprise into a kind of theme park -- with very expensive rides. </p> <p> A new company, MIGS Etc., of Sarasota, Fla., will arrange for tourists to fly, for a price, almost any variety of Russian aircraft, from L-39 training jets to top-of-the-line MIG-29 jet fighters. Customers need not be pilots, let alone fighter pilots; experienced Russian jet jockeys accompany them on all flights. Prices start at $6,000 and go up to $45,000 for a program that involves a simulated dogfight. </p> <p> The Cossacks are coming, straight out of some 19th-century nightmare. Those fearsome horsemen once again stalk the Russian steppes, whips stashed in their boots and swords tucked in their belts, defending God and country and longing for the restoration of the Romanov dynasty. </p> <p> When last seen, they were being obliterated in the bloody Soviet collectivization drives of the 1930's; a million of them died. Before the Revolution, they had become infamous as the nail in the czarist boot, putting down peasant and worker uprisings and leading pogroms against the Jews and other minorities. </p> <p> Israel has sold advanced military technology to China for more than a decade and is moving to expand its cooperation with Beijing, says R. James Woolsey, the Director of Central Intelligence. </p> <p> The C.I.A. assessment was provided in written responses to questions by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. The committee made the assessment public last week as part of a report on recent hearings it conducted on "proliferation threats of the 1990's," a committee aide said tonight. </p> <p> After an urgent appeal for help from Georgia's embattled leader, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, Russian officials said today that they were considering joint action with other countries in the Caucasus region to protect Georgia's main supply route from rebel attacks. </p> <p> But Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev and Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev ruled out any direct Russian military intervention in Georgia, where Mr. Shevardnadze is caught in a desperate fight for survival against a rebellion led by his archrival, former President Zviad Gamsakhurdia. </p> <p> Among the security ministers clustered with President Boris N. Yeltsin on Sunday night, pondering how to quell the armed uprising that was taking place at the Parliament center, the Mayor's office, and the television center, Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev was the key official. </p> <p> Not only was he the senior military officer, who knew best which army units could be trusted to stay loyal to the Kremlin, and the man who would have to organize and order the actual assault. </p> <p> Russia has a computerized system that can automatically fire its nuclear arsenal in wartime if military commanders are dead or unable to direct the battle, a leading American expert on the Russian military says. </p> <p> The Russians call it the "dead hand," according to the expert, who personally characterizes it as a doomsday machine. If the system in fact exists -- and some American intelligence analysts say it is unlikely but possible -- it would mark the first known time in the nuclear era that a machine has been readied to press the button. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin, apparently under pressure from his armed forces, has sent a letter to President Clinton opposing any expansion of NATO to include East European nations like Poland or the Czech Republic, Western diplomats said today. </p> <p> Sent after President Yeltsin dissolved Parliament on Sept. 21 and embarked on a collision course with members opposed to his reforms, the letter amounts to sharp retreat from the position the Russian leader outlined during a visit to Warsaw in August. At the time he expressed understanding of Poland's desire to join NATO and said it did not threaten Russian interests. </p> <p> As Russia's fate hung in the balance one week ago, President Boris N. Yeltsin's Government seemed almost paralyzed. </p> <p> While bands of Communist and nationalist gunmen broke through to the Parliament building, the headquarters of President Yeltsin's foes, and battled for the state television center, the large force of special police around the building disintegrated, presidential aides were in disarray, the President dallied at his dacha and soldiers from elite units were out picking potatoes. </p> <p> President Clinton will meet Russia's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, in Moscow in mid-January as part of the Administration's campaign to support Mr. Yeltsin's struggle to transform his country into a free-market democracy. </p> <p> The trip, announced today by Secretary of State Warren Christopher at a joint news conference here with Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev, is also evidently intended to enhance Mr. Clinton's standing as a statesman and divert the spotlight from the Administration's foreign policy setbacks in Bosnia, Haiti and Somalia. The Administration would clearly like to focus attention on its support for democratization in Russia, the foreign policy area where the Clinton Administration feels it has been most successful. Separate Trip for Gore </p> <p> It was also announced in Washington that Vice President Al Gore will make a separate trip to Moscow, three days after the Russian parliamentary elections, scheduled for Dec. 12. </p> <p> 5:20 A.M. Monday: (10:20 P.M. Sunday, Eastern time) Troops loyal to President Boris N. Yeltsin are deployed around the Kremlin and the Defense Ministry general staff building. Fighting dies down at the headquarters of Russian television, and the building remains in the hands of pro-Yeltsin forces. </p> <p> 6:45: Yeltsin representatives hold bitter talks with envoys from Parliament as troops enter Moscow. The meeting ends without agreement. </p> <p> Tanks and troops loyal to President Boris N. Yeltsin today crushed an armed uprising by his opponents with a potent show of force that left their white riverside stronghold battered and in flames. </p> <p> The Parliament building, known as the White House, was shaken by huge explosions from 125-millimeter shells fired from T-72 and T-80 tanks. As crack airborne troops conducted a floor-by-floor assault, hundreds of legislators, defenders and supporters began filing out of the building shortly before 5 P.M. Their leaders followed at 6 P.M. (11 A.M., Eastern time). </p> <p> The assault on the Russian Parliament building today was a textbook example of the decisive application of military power. But for all the firepower -- and the fires burning inside tonight showed that there was plenty -- the attack was punctuated by long lulls as the Russian military waited to see if the rebels would yield. </p> <p> Strobe Talbott, the American Ambassador at Large to the former Soviet republics, said President Boris N. Yeltsin's aides had indicated that they considered two basic tactics: an all-out attack or a gradual operation that would give the anti-Yeltsin forces an opportunity to surrender. </p> <p> The defeated leaders of the armed uprising against President Boris N. Yeltsin may not have had a broad popular base. But the criticism leveled by these men, Aleksandr V. Rutskoi and Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, against Mr. Yeltsin, his policies and his embrace of one-man rule has resonated with a broad swath of Russians who regard themselves as centrists. </p> <p> This broad center reacted with disgust to the motley collection of Communists, ultranationalists, fascists, bully boys and anti-Semites who clustered around the Parliament's cause. But while most Russians are surely relieved to have order restored, they did not stir themselves to rally for Mr. Yeltsin. </p> <p> The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed today that the Russian military doctrine adopted on Tuesday abandoned the old Soviet pledge not to use nuclear weapons first. </p> <p> Gen. Pavel S. Grachev said at a news conference at the Defense Ministry that the doctrine ruled out the use of nuclear weapons against nonnuclear states that had signed the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty, unless they were allied with a nuclear-armed country. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin's Security Council approved new guiding principles today for the Russian Army in a long-awaited "military doctrine," which declares that the main source of military danger is no longer any nation or alliance, but small local conflicts. </p> <p> The 24-page document was not immediately published, but much of it has already been publicly discussed, and the Interfax news agency offered additional details supplied by Valery Manilov, the Security Council official who prepared the final draft. </p> <p> An unusual coalition of Russian military experts and conservative former Pentagon officials is urging Moscow and Washington to take most of their nuclear missiles off alert. </p> <p> The proposal is part of a broad package of measures to reduce the threat of nuclear miscalculation. It also comes as Defense Secretary Les Aspin has started a broad review of United States nuclear forces and strategy. </p> <p> Russia and China signed a five-year military cooperation agreement today that is expected to broaden the transfer of military technology to China. But the Russian Defense Minister, Gen. Pavel Grachev, said the expanded cooperation would not be used "against any third country." </p> <p> Chinese and Russian officials also emphasized that General Grachev was not here to negotiate any new sale of Russian weapons to China, which has been a matter of concern to China's neighbors and to the United States. </p> <p> Russia has reacted angrily to Ukraine's partial and highly conditional ratification of a major nuclear-arms treaty, saying Ukraine's decision to retain 58 percent of its 1,650 warheads could destabilize "the entire system of international relations, especially in Europe." </p> <p> The decision, made by Ukraine's Parliament on Thursday, was also a severe embarrassment to the Clinton Administration, which has thus far failed to persuade the Ukrainians to abide by their President's commitment to become a non-nuclear state. </p> <p> Dismembered and demoralized, unloved at home and no longer so feared in the West, the Russian armed forces are the most unwieldy and troublesome legacy of the Soviet empire. </p> <p> Draft evasion is rampant, and if the current call-up goes as badly as some fear, officers might actually outnumber enlisted men. Young officers are quitting in droves, leaving behind a top-heavy and hollow force. By some accounts, there are more generals now on the Russian General Staff than there were in the Soviet days, even though the Russian Army is less than 40 percent of what the Soviet force was. </p> <p> This well-kept military base 40 miles north of Moscow is the home of Russia's 18th Unified Motorized Brigade, which includes tank, artillery and anti-aircraft battalions. It has also become a squalid housing project for officers and their families back from Germany and Lithuania after the collapse of the Soviet Union. </p> <p> Capt. Andrei A. Tarada and his wife, Larissa, both 30 years old, and their children, a son of 12, and a daughter, 8, are living like refugees. All of them, and their white angora cat, live in a single tiny room in a wooden office building, with a revolting communal toilet, no kitchen and no privacy. </p> <p> Russia's foreign intelligence service warned NATO today that any move to incorporate Eastern European countries would force Moscow into "fundamental" military countermeasures and heighten anti-Western sentiments. </p> <p> Some of the countries of Eastern Europe formerly under Soviet domination, like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, have asked to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. While the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, reacted calmly to the idea in late August, the Russian military has pushed him to reconsider. On Sept. 30, Mr. Yeltsin wrote Western leaders warning them against expanding the alliance eastward. </p> <p> In a country that voraciously devours conspiracy theories, the relatively low death toll in the showdown last month between President Boris N. Yeltsin and his opponents has become a matter of considerable conjecture. </p> <p> The Main Medical Administration of Moscow says 144 people were killed and 878 wounded on Oct. 3 and 4, when rebels clashed with troops loyal to Mr. Yeltsin. </p> <p> Deep in the Ural Mountains, Russian engineers are busy building a vast underground command post to use in case of a nuclear war. Equipped with an antenna for communicating with missile-carrying submarines and land-based mobile missiles, the bunker will be a new part of Russia's multi-billion-dollar effort to modernize its dwindling strategic nuclear forces. </p> <p> Russia's soldiers may miss a paycheck or two, but the military is determined to maintain Russia's status as a nuclear superpower. </p> <p> Here on the Russian steppes 650 miles southeast of Moscow, Maj. Gen. Anatoly Sidyakin is trying to teach his men a new military lesson. </p> <p> For four decades, the 27th Division was stationed in East Germany as part of the Group Soviet Forces Germany, the cream of the Russian Army, standing eyeball-to-eyeball with the Americans. </p> <p> President Clinton issued a stern warning today to North Korea not to develop a nuclear weapon as it continues to block international inspections of its nuclear sites. </p> <p> "North Korea cannot be allowed to develop a nuclear bomb," Mr. Clinton said in an interview on the NBC News program "Meet the Press." "We have to be very firm about it." </p> <p> Most of the Russian Army may be reeling from the collapse of the Soviet Union and the blow to its professional pride, but it is boom time for Russia's 201st Motorized Rifle Division, stationed abroad in nominally independent Tajikistan. </p> <p> The 201st, as a rear-echelon force in what was the Soviet Union's poorest republic, had been under strength for years by as much as 40 percent. </p> <p> In her cramped apartment outside the gates of the Russian military base on the outskirts of the Latvian capital, Lyubov Umanskaya is packed up and waiting to go. </p> <p> "It is like living in a railway station," said the 38-year-old wife of a Russian major, sitting among the boxes and shipping crates that have filled the living room in her small three-room apartment for the better part of a year. </p> <p> Secretary of State Warren Christopher redefined priorities for America's foreign policy today, but restoring democracy to Haiti, ending the war in Bosnia and reconciling warring parties in Somalia were not on his list. </p> <p> In his first formal appearance before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee since May, Mr. Christopher sought to divert attention from the Administration's performance in those three countries, dismissing them as "difficult situations" where "things have not gone exactly as we had planned." </p> <p> It started out as a bright idea to strengthen ties between the American and Russian military. But so far it has strained relations with Washington's key European allies. </p> <p> The proposal was for American and Russian troops to exercise together for the first time, probably at a NATO training base at Hohenfils, Germany. </p> <p> Britain said today that it would substantially scale back its plans for a new generation of submarine-carried nuclear missiles. </p> <p> Government officials said that under a policy to be announced on Tuesday by Defense Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, the size of the planned submarine-based nuclear force, as measured by the number of warheads carried, would be limited to that of the current force. </p> <p> Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev of Russia said today that the condition of nuclear warheads in Ukraine had sharply deteriorated and that some of them could lead to an incident worse than the accident at Chernobyl. </p> <p> "This alarm is shared by both the Ukrainian and Russian leadership," Mr. Kozyrev said after meeting at this Black Sea port for talks on eliminating former Soviet nuclear weapons. </p> <p> Fearing that Russia is reassuming its historical role as an imperial power, Poland's Foreign Minister says the countries of Eastern Europe want a concrete commitment from Washington and Western Europe on membership in NATO. </p> <p> So far, Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski said in an interview on Friday, the West has failed to understand that a post-cold-war security vacuum in Eastern Europe could be filled by a resurgent Russia. </p> <p> Over the objections of the United States, Russian cargo planes flew special truck chassis that are commonly used for mobile missile launchers from North Korea to Syria last summer, Clinton Administration officials say. </p> <p> Aides familiar with classified intelligence reports said two large Russian Condor planes had flown the vehicles in August from Sunan airfield in North Korea to Damascus. American intelligence officials said the vehicles had probably been taken from there to a missile plant at Nasariya for use in Syria's Scud missile program. </p> <p> In a largely symbolic move that could reduce the dangers of accidental launchings, the Pentagon has drafted a plan to aim its nuclear missiles at desolate spots in the open seas and is talking with Russian generals about how to put a mutual pledge to "de-target" into effect. </p> <p> Throughout the cold war, the most pressing question for the targeting experts at the United States Strategic Command in Omaha was how many nuclear warheads to aim at Russia's missile silos and military bases. </p> <p> The sizable vote for an ultranationalist in Russia's parliamentary elections two weeks ago is providing the Government with a further weapon in its campaign against the extension of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to Central and Eastern Europe. </p> <p> An eastward extension of NATO would be just the sort of humiliation that would drive wounded Russian pride further toward the far rightists led by Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, says the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev. </p> <p> In his first major assessment of Russia's parliamentary elections, President Boris N. Yeltsin today described the vote as a major reprimand. He said that he would keep his current economic team and its reform program but that his Government would give more attention to the problems of the poor and introduce a "new, more open style." </p> <p> At a Kremlin news conference, Mr. Yeltsin acknowledged the successes of those who had used "primitive nationalism, outright lies and even dangerous provocations," but he avoided direct criticism of the person he saw as the major beneficiary of those tactics, Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky. </p> <p> For the paratroops of the 39th Air Assault Brigade, the hilltop compound here would have been the jump-off point for a Soviet invasion of Western Europe. Now it belongs to Ukraine, which is trying to shape remnants of the Soviet Army into a force it can truly call its own. </p> <p> Col. Mykhailo Koval, the commander of the base, wears the blue beret of Ukrainian air mobile troops. But the colonel concedes that this new army remains to be taught "that it is honorable to defend a Ukrainian motherland." </p> <p> Russia and China plan to sign an agreement next year aimed at preventing inadvertent or dangerous military confrontations between their forces, a diplomat familiar with the plans said. </p> <p> A Chinese commitment to go ahead with the agreement was given to Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev of Russia during his visit to the Chinese capital last month, the diplomat said, and marks a further reduction in tensions between the former Communist rivals. </p> <p> Ukraine's President has told President Clinton that Kiev is prepared to deactivate its nuclear arsenal, including its entire force of modern SS-24 missiles, Clinton Administration officials said today. </p> <p> The assurance was conveyed last month by President Leonid Kravchuk in a telephone conversation with Mr. Clinton, the officials said. </p> <p> MY FIRST LOOK AT POST-SOVIET AVIation was not confidence-building. From the rusting outhouse to the old planes lining the Tarmac in various stages of cannibalization, the little airfield some 100 miles west of Moscow might have been home to a fly-by-night crop-duster in a 1940's B movie. </p> <p> Why, then, am I -- the sort who buckles his seat belt to move the car in the driveway -- perched on a bench in the tumbledown flight-operations center, struggling to memorize the three ways to trigger a VS-1-BRI rocket-assisted aircraft ejection seat? </p> <p> In the rush of attention surrounding Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, whose platform of empire and crime-busting attracted nearly a quarter of Russian voters on Sunday, there is considerable speculation about how soldiers cast their ballots. </p> <p> Given the unhappy state of the military and its crucial role in the last two attempted coups, most recently in October, the assumption has been that Mr. Zhirinovsky's call for harsh discipline and restoration of the Russian empire would bring him significant backing from soldiers and officers. </p> <p> For days phone calls have been coming in from Russian friends, explaining to me and themselves how in their homeland a fascist nationalist could have become a strong contender for power. </p> <p> In their explanations, and much of the American intellectual and political reaction, ran a theme of Western failure or guilt: </p> <p> The United States offered today to mediate a range of thorny security disputes between Russia and Ukraine, including military protection for Ukraine, the dismantling of its nuclear arsenal and Russian compensation for Ukraine's highly enriched uranium, senior State Department officials said today. </p> <p> Secretary of State Warren Christopher made the offer during a meeting with Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Anatoly Zlenko, as part of the Clinton Administration's strategy to nudge Ukraine into giving up its nuclear weapons by offering it political and economic incentives, the officials said. </p> <p> When the Government was on the verge of being overthrown by insurrectionists loyal to an ousted President, the Georgian leader, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, appealed to Russia for help. In exchange, he agreed to bring Georgia into the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Russian-dominated organization of former Soviet republics -- something Georgia had resolutely refused to do. </p> <p> Soon, Russian troops here came out of their barracks, and the marines landed at the port of Poti. Within less than a month the civil war was over, with Mr. Shevardnadze victorious. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration has proposed updating the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to accommodate a new anti-missile system designed to protect against third-world threats, Clinton Administration officials disclosed today. </p> <p> To underscore the significance the Administration attaches to the change, a White House official flew to Geneva early this week to propose the modification to Russian arms negotiators. </p> <p> The two couples at the Podolskys' dinner table had spent their lives working for the Russian military-industrial complex, which dominates this city. The work could be hard, they said, but it was patriotic, and they had been well-enough paid. </p> <p> Now, with the Soviet Union gone and military orders down sharply, factories in trouble and layoffs no longer just a rumor, the Podolskys and Kondratenkos have begun to wonder if the sacrifices were worthwhile. </p> <p> In the 1940's, the secret ministry charged with developing the Soviet atomic bomb took over the tiny village of Obninsk. About 65 miles southwest of Moscow, it was close enough to be central, but far enough away not to endanger the capital and the Soviet leadership in the event of a nuclear accident. </p> <p> Today, what is now called the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry remains in effect the owner of Obninsk. The main city square of what has become a well-kept city of 120,000 features an electronic sign that shows the time, the temperature and the radiation level. </p> <p> Divergent Russian and NATO visions of the future of European security clashed today as President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia repeated his opposition to any eastward expansion of the Atlantic alliance and top NATO officials said the door must be left open for the eventual admission of new members. </p> <p> At a meeting here with the NATO Secretary General, Manfred Worner, Mr. Yeltsin outlined a Russian view that NATO membership for Eastern European countries that want to join the alliance, like Poland or the Czech Republic, would be unacceptable to Moscow, Russian and NATO officials said. </p> <p> Eleven nuclear processing factories in six states may be vulnerable to the same kind of chemical explosion that spread radioactive contamination in a wide area around a Russian plant last April, according to a report by the staff of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. </p> <p> The April explosion, which contaminated nearly 50 square miles around the Siberian city of Tomsk-7, involved chemical compounds that are used in American plants run by the Department of Energy, according to the report. At most of those plants, plutonium for bombs is separated from other materials in processing tanks. </p> <p> President Clinton extended his hand here tonight to a Ukrainian President he had shunned, and Leonid Kravchuk returned the gesture with his first public endorsement of a three-way accord requiring Ukraine to surrender its nuclear weapons. </p> <p> A joint appearance by the Presidents after an airport meeting tonight appeared to put to rest the last doubts about whether the agreement would indeed be signed on Friday in Moscow, as Russia and the United States announced with considerable hullabaloo at the beginning of the week. </p> <p> In a tour of the world's horizons from his perspective as Director of Central Intelligence, R. James Woolsey said today that his major concerns include the possibility of destructive hyperinflation in Russia, political and ethnic tensions that could fragment Ukraine and a military buildup in North Korea. </p> <p> While none of these events pose an immediate danger to the United States, "the end of the cold war does not mean the end of conflict, nor the end to threats to our security and to that of our friends and allies," Mr. Woolsey said during testimony at a public session of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. </p> <p> President Clinton announced tonight that the United States, Russia and Ukraine had reached an agreement for the destruction of Ukraine's entire nuclear arsenal, 175 long-range missiles and more than 1,800 warheads. He described the deal as "a hopeful and historic breakthrough" that would not only benefit the three signers but enhance world security. </p> <p> If it takes effect -- and questions lingered tonight about important details of ratification and timing -- the agreement would mean that all three of the non-Russian republics left with nuclear weapons at the breakup of the Soviet Union would have undertaken to surrender them voluntarily. Kazakhstan and Belarus, the other two countries, agreed last year to give up their warheads. Accidents Feared </p> <p> Ukraine was the most difficult case, and the negotiations on the deal continued by telephone through this morning. Their success, Administration officials hoped, would help to reduce tensions between Moscow and Kiev, shore up the tottering Ukrainian economy and stabilize a shaky region. </p> <p> In the face of growing tensions with Russia, leaders of Latvia's Parliament will travel to Washington this weekend to seek American assurances over a compromise mediated by the United States that is intended to speed the withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia. </p> <p> Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs of Latvia and the leaders of rival political groups will meet with State Department, White House and Congressional officials for three days, beginning Sunday, to listen to details of a plan diplomats here say would allow Russia to maintain civilian control of its early-warning anti-ballistic missile installation near Skrunda, on the Latvian coast, for four more years. </p> <p> Two relatively young and sophisticated men, both setting policy at their nations' foreign ministries, have changed their positions radically in the past few months. Their shifts reveal much about the deterioration of Russian-American relations. </p> <p> One is Strobe Talbott, longtime friend and Oxford roommate of Bill Clinton's. He stepped down from the power and prestige of Time magazine columnist to handle President Clinton's dealings with the nations of the former Soviet Union, and was recently named Deputy Secretary of State. </p> <p> President Clinton plunged into a nationally televised "town meeting" today to urge Russians to stay the course toward a free market and democracy and to find a "new definition of Russia's greatness." </p> <p> Clearly stimulated by candid and provoking questions from a live, youthful audience at the Ostankino television center in Moscow and similar groups linked by television from other cities, Mr. Clinton was alternatively professor, politician and preacher as he counseled Russians to "choose the future." </p> <p> The Ukrainian Government, taking a markedly more reserved approach to the agreement President Clinton announced on eliminating Ukraine's nuclear weapons, said today that the accord was still under discussion and might not be signed in Moscow on Friday. </p> <p> Adding to the doubts surrounding the accord, the Ukrainian President, Leonid M. Kravchuk, has yet to mention the agreement publicly, and several members of Ukraine's Parliament said he would have a tough time winning ratification of the deal. There has been strong opposition in Parliament to giving up the weapons because of a perceived threat from Russia. Quick Stop in Kiev </p> <p> President Clinton is scheduled to stop for two hours at the airport here Wednesday afternoon for a largely symbolic meeting with President Kravchuk before flying on to Moscow. Mr. Kravchuk has been snubbed by the White House until now because of his country's refusal to destroy its nuclear arsenal, the third-largest in the world. Mr. Kravchuk is then supposed to fly to Moscow to sign the accord with Mr. Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia on Friday. </p> <p> North Korea has quietly begun purchasing 40 aging attack submarines from Russia's Pacific Fleet through a small Japanese trading company, according to Japanese, South Korean and American officials tracking the movements of the subs through the North Pacific. </p> <p> Military and intelligence experts have offered conflicting explanations for why North Korea would want leftover hulks of the Russian Navy. Some experts raised the possibility that North Korea could try to restore the submarines to bolster its fleet, or cannibalize them for spare parts; Russian officials insist that the vessels are being sold to the Communist Government of President Kim Il Sung solely for use as scrap metal. </p> <p> About 400 Russian soldiers arrived today under a United Nations flag in this Serbian stronghold and were greeted with liquor and song as the Serbs' brothers and protectors. </p> <p> Heralded by the Bosnian Serb nationalists as their safeguard against a threatened NATO air attack, the Russians abandoned all pretense of United Nations impartiality before an explosion of local joy as they were greeted by a crowd of at least 300 people with their three-fingered Serbian salute. The Russians allowed children to board their trucks and armored personnel carriers while accepting gifts of the local plum brandy and a red rose. </p> <p> Nearly all the Serbian guns ringing the Bosnian capital are out of action, United Nations officials said early this morning after a frantic day of diplomatic meetings, maneuvering behind the scenes and hoisting rusty cannons out of snowbanks. </p> <p> The United Nations envoy to the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, said that the work accomplished by the United Nations peacekeepers "up to this point assures us there is no need for air strikes." He spoke in Zagreb, the Croatian capital, after conferring by phone with the NATO command. </p> <p> As the United States and its Western allies seek to shape a joint response to Saturday's deadly mortar attack in Sarajevo, they are being forced to maneuver around an irate Russia trying to stop them from sending NATO warplanes against Bosnia's Serbs, with whom it feels linked by ethnic and religious bonds. </p> <p> This means any plan the allies adopt must conform with existing Security Council resolutions since they dare not ask the Council for new authority for fear of running into a Russian veto. </p> <p> The lawyer representing Aldrich H. Ames, the Central Intelligence Agency official accused of spying for Moscow, said today that Mr. Ames would fight the charges against him, raising the prospect of a messy trial that could involve secrets the agency would rather not disclose. </p> <p> The lawyer for Mr. Ames's wife, Maria del Rosario Casas Ames, also issued a statement denouncing the accusations in a Federal Bureau of Investigation affidavit that was unsealed on Tuesday after the couple were arrested. </p> <p> Russia and Georgia signed a cooperation treaty today that will increase Moscow's military influence there and tighten its ties with the embattled Georgian Government of Eduard A. Shevardnadze. </p> <p> The treaty, one of two dozen documents signed today by Mr. Shevardnadze and President Boris N. Yeltsin in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, will allow Russia to keep three military bases on Georgian soil past 1995, while committing the Russian military to train and supply the Georgian Army. </p> <p> In a sober address from the Oval Office, President Clinton said today that the United States and its allies were determined to carry out air strikes against Bosnian Serbs around Sarajevo unless they "fully comply" with a NATO ultimatum to withdraw heavy weapons by 7 P.M. Eastern time Sunday night. </p> <p> As Serbian trucks continued to withdraw big guns from around the Bosnian capital, Mr. Clinton spoke of "some encouraging signs" that the threat of action might compel the Serbs to meet the allies' demands. By this afternoon, American officials said, it appeared that fewer than 100 Serbian mortars, artillery pieces and other heavy weapons remained in place. </p> <p> The United States was caught by surprise by a Russian announcement that it would send troops to Sarajevo to help the Bosnian Serbs withdraw or surrender control of their heavy weapons, as required by the NATO ultimatum last week, senior Administration officials said today. </p> <p> The officials welcomed the Russian offer, as well as a Russian-brokered promise by the Bosnian Serbs to comply with the NATO ultimatum, but added that the United States was still wholeheartedly committed to launching air strikes if the Bosnian Serbs defied it. </p> <p> In winning a pledge from the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy artillery from the outskirts of Sarajevo, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia scored a badly needed diplomatic triumph today, one that is likely to work for him at home as well as abroad. </p> <p> The Serbs' commitment, like previous developments that have stirred hope in the brutal two-year Bosnian war, is necessarily tenuous, depending as it does on the compliance of warring parties that have so far found no good reason to lay down their guns. </p> <p> The United States, supported by Britain, France and Russia, appealed to China today to put renewed pressure on North Korea to open its nuclear installations to international inspection and warned they will start pressing for Security Council sanctions against the Pyongyang Government if it has not done so by Feb. 21. </p> <p> This is the starting date for a three-day meeting of the 35-nation executive board of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, which, in the absence of any new North Korean concessions by then, is expected to endorse the agency's view that it can no longer give the the assurances it needs to about the peaceful nature of North Korea's nuclear program. </p> <p> In an effort to prod Russia to agree to international inspections of its nuclear weapons materials, the United States is putting some of its own surplus under international control, Clinton Administration officials said today. </p> <p> Administration officials said about 7 of the 100 tons of plutonium the United States had produced for military purposes would be put in storage for inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. </p> <p> The Director of Central Intelligence said today that he would appoint a panel of outside experts to review weaknesses in the agency's counterintelligence and internal security departments exposed by the case of Aldrich H. Ames, the C.I.A. officer accused of spying for Moscow. </p> <p> But the head of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence said he doubted that such a panel would change the "culture and mentality" within those departments that had allowed Mr. Ames to spy undetected for nearly nine years, as the Federal Bureau of Investigation has asserted. </p> <p> Despite complaints by Ukraine that Russia is not living up to its end of the deal, Defense Secretary William J. Perry said tonight that he was satisfied that the agreement to remove all of Ukraine's nuclear weapons is on track. </p> <p> A Ukrainian official said Monday that Moscow had not delivered any fuel in return for 120 nuclear warheads Ukraine had sent back to Russia. Defense Minister Vitaly Radetsky said that if Russia does not provide the fuel, Ukraine "will reconsider the timetable" for shipping the remaining 1,600 warheads. </p> <p> Defense Secretary William J. Perry, arguing that the instability in Russia could lead to a renewal of the cold war, said today that the Pentagon needed to continue nuclear weapons programs to "hedge" against that possibility. </p> <p> In a speech at George Washington University two days before he is to leave for a trip to Russia and several Soviet republics, Mr. Perry made a forceful argument for continuing military cooperation with Moscow and providing aid to the former Soviet states to dismantle their weapons of mass destruction. </p> <p> Yesterday in Moscow, Russia's chief prosecutor dropped all charges against Vil Mirzayanov, a chemist who was jailed for revealing that the Soviets had secretly developed a binary nerve gas, code-named Novichok, that is 8 to 10 times as powerful as anything in America's arsenal. </p> <p> For speaking out, Mr. Mirzayanov was imprisoned twice and put on trial for supposedly disclosing state secrets. His vindication, due in large part to Western pressure, is a promising event, but it leaves unaddressed the larger issues of Russia's intentions in the field of chemical warfare. </p> <p> The Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, which is scheduled to close in 1995, may get an unusual reprieve: new work dismantling Russian warships. </p> <p> Two Pennsylvania lawmakers, a Senate Intelligence Committee staff member and a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official worked out a proposal this week to keep the shipyard open for 10 years by converting much of the Russian fleet into scrap metal. </p> <p> Opening the way to a possible military partnership with the West, Russia said today that it might soon join the loose alliance with NATO that many former Eastern Bloc countries hope will lead to full membership. </p> <p> "At the end of this month we will be ready," Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev told reporters after meeting with Secretary of Defense William J. Perry at military headquarters. </p> <p> The United States has devised a novel means to verify the dismantling of American and Russian warheads and the Pentagon wants to propose it to Moscow, Pentagon officials said today. </p> <p> The monitoring would be intended to fill a gap in American and Russian arms control agreements. While the two sides have extensive procedures to monitor the number of missiles and bombers they have deployed, they have not allowed each other to observe the dismantling of warheads or measure the fissionable material that has been extracted. </p> <p> Ending more than two years of often bitter negotiations, Russian and Latvian diplomats agreed Tuesday on an August deadline for the pullout of Russian troops, and an extended four-year lease on a Russian early-warning radar station on the coast at Skrunda. </p> <p> The agreement is expected to be signed in early April by President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and President Guntis Ulmanis of Latvia, spokesmen said today. </p> <p> "Frankly, if the response of governments remains the way it is today, we couldn't get another operation off the ground," said Kofi Annan, the soft-spoken Ghanian who heads the United Nations peacekeeping department, as he surveyed his empire from his 37th-floor office, stuffed with African carvings, medals and plaques. </p> <p> He has a Canadian general and 50 other military officers, most lent by their governments, working for him here at United Nations headquarters as well a civilian staff of 80. He has a round-the-clock situation room with secure communication links to the 17 operations he is currently running in trouble spots all over the world. </p> <p> As several companies of Russian soldiers bid their farewells to Germany one recent evening, their mood was as cold and bitter as the night air outside the shabby train station here. </p> <p> "We're leaving because we're under orders to leave, but none of us want to go," an officer in his mid-40's said as he prepared for the 36-hour ride to Moscow. "I won't have a place to live when I get back home. The Germans killed millions of our people and burned a third of our country, and now they're all rich and we're being kicked out like dogs." </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine reached a new agreement today on the division of the much-disputed Black Sea Fleet. The announcement of the accord came at the end of a week in which the two-year quarrel threatened for the first time to lead to armed conflict. </p> <p> A spokesman for Mr. Yeltsin said the agreement provides for 15 to 20 percent of the fleet's 300-odd ships to be handed over to Ukraine and acknowledges the rights of both countries to separate bases for their Black Sea naval vessels. </p> <p> Conflicts between President Boris N. Yeltsin and his Government have confused diplomats and complicated the West's efforts to gauge the intentions behind Russia's more assertive foreign policy, especially in former republics of the Soviet Union. </p> <p> A week after contradictory declarations from Mr. Yeltsin and his Foreign and Defense Ministries over when Russia may join a military cooperation program with NATO, confusion arose today over Russia's desire to negotiate permanent arrangements on military bases in the neighboring republics. </p> <p> Minutes before a Federal judge sentenced him to prison for the rest of his life, Aldrich H. Ames, a C.I.A. officer, expressed profound shame today for betraying his country. But he said he had spied for Moscow because American intelligence agencies had grown into "a self-serving interest group, immeasurably aided by secrecy." </p> <p> In a meandering statement that alternated between apology and defiance, Mr. Ames expressed regret that agents working for the Central Intelligence Agency in the former Soviet Union might have been imprisoned or executed as a result of his betrayal of them. But he said of himself and his wife, "We made similar choices and suffer similar consequences." </p> <p> Although he protested that the business of spying was an absurd game, Aldrich H. Ames confessed today to what the Government called the most grievous betrayals in the annals of American intelligence. </p> <p> He said he handed over to Moscow the identities of at least 12 Soviet and Eastern European espionage agents working secretly for the United States in the 1980's. They are said to be dead or missing. He boasted of "the huge quantity of information on United States foreign, defense and security policies" that he revealed. He said he worked to make the budgets, strategies and technologies of large sectors of American intelligence, which are kept secret from Americans, an open book to the Soviet and later the Russian Government. </p> <p> Following are excerpts from a statement made by Aldrich H. Ames and released by his lawyers after Mr. Ames pleaded guilty today to espionage and tax evasion charges in Federal District Court: </p> <p> I bitterly regret the catastrophe which my betrayal of trust has brought upon my wife and son and upon any who have loved or cared for me. No punishment by this court can balance or ease the profound shame and guilt which I bear. </p> <p> The National Reconnaissance Office, the nation's largest and most secretive intelligence service, plans to launch a new spy satellite on Saturday that is the most expensive electronic-eavesdropping equipment ever built, Pentagon officials and private analysts say. </p> <p> Almost everything about the launching is secret, including the name of the satellite, its cost and its mission. But analysts outside the Government say that the satellite's primary mission is to eavesdrop on Russia and that its cost exceeds $1.5 billion. </p> <p> President Clinton, after overriding the publicly stated opinions of his own Secretary of Defense and top military officer, sent U.S. airplanes into action in Bosnia by the decision of a British general. </p> <p> How often, how hard and how deep will United States planes strike again? </p> <p> Faced with turmoil and instability along its southern flank, Russia has appealed to the West for a review of cold-war-era limits on the conventional weapons it is allowed to deploy in its border regions, military analysts say. </p> <p> Moscow's main argument is that when it agreed to the 1990 treaty limiting such forces, it was a different country with an entirely different set of military concerns centered around the possibility of a war with NATO. Now, the Russians say, their main concern is instability on their southern flank. </p> <p> The Russian military has repositioned forces along its northern and southern flanks as they return from Central Europe, raising concern among NATO and United States officials who say the redeployment exceeds limits scheduled to take effect next year under a treaty reducing conventional weapons in Europe. </p> <p> The deployments, and Moscow's effort to renegotiate the treaty to accommodate them, are emerging as a major irritant in the Pentagon's efforts to forge closer relations with the Russian military. </p> <p> A Russian special envoy indicated today that Bosnian Serb leaders had assured him they would cease their offensive against the United Nations-declared "safe area" of Gorazde, the Muslim enclave where NATO aircraft bombed Serbian forces earlier this week. </p> <p> "I think I've got a commitment from the Serbs that it is not their intention to resume fighting," the Russian envoy, Vitaly Churkin, said. "I may be able to introduce some new elements in the situation to reinforce the effective cease-fire that is there now." </p> <p> In an effort to stem the spread of nuclear weapons, the Clinton Administration has asked Moscow to disclose how much plutonium and highly enriched uranium it has and where it can be found. </p> <p> The proposal is part of a broad Administration effort to insure that nuclear material in Russia is properly accounted for and is stored safely. It also reflects growing concern that Russia's system for keeping track of its nuclear material is not up to Western standards and that the Russian bureaucracy needs to be prodded into taking stronger action. </p> <p> When Gen. Pavel S. Grachev, the Russian Defense Minister, visits NATO in Brussels on Monday, he goes as the embattled boss of a demoralized military that has found itself having to lobby publicly for money from a Government it saved, however reluctantly, only seven months ago. </p> <p> General Grachev will tell NATO what sort of "special status" Russia wants in order to join a NATO program offering informal relations to the formerly Communist countries of Eastern Europe. </p> <p> On May 30, the United States and Russia will no longer aim their strategic missiles at each other. A missile fired accidentally and flying under its own normal motor power and guidance would fall short of its cold-war target, landing instead in the Arctic Ocean. </p> <p> But the risk of such an accidental launch is low compared to other safety hazards. And this symbolic agreement does nothing to alleviate them. </p> <p> A senior Russian law enforcement official said today that organized crime in Russia was trying to infiltrate military installations to steal nuclear material and sell it on the black market. </p> <p> "These crime groups in recent years are demonstrating more and more interest toward the defense facilities of the former Soviet Union," Mikhail Yegorov, head of the organized crime control department of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, said in an appearance before a Congressional committee. </p> <p> The Russian Defense Minister, Pavel S. Grachev, said today that he strongly supported a plan for the first joint military exercises with the United States, scheduled to be held in Russia. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin had thrown the plan in doubt last month when the North Atlantic Treaty Organization bombed the Bosnian Serbs without what Russian officials regarded as sufficient consultation. The idea of American troops operating on Russian soil has caused a furor among nationalist groups here, many of which appear to be gaining power. </p> <p> Soldiers from the United States, Britain and France marched through Berlin today in a military farewell to the city their armies entered as victors and then guarded for nearly half a century. </p> <p> Cannons boomed in salute, parachutists fell through the clouds and helicopters flew in formation as an estimated 75,000 spectators watched the soldiers step smartly through the streets to the beat of martial music. A lone DC-3 represented the planes that took part in the Berlin airlift of 1948-49, when the Soviet authorities established a blockade between West Berlin and West Germany. </p> <p> The United States will ask North Korea to surrender some 8,000 plutonium-bearing reactor fuel rods to a third country, like Russia or China, or entomb them indefinitely in a concrete sarcophagus as part of any settlement to the dispute over its nuclear program. </p> <p> Any country receiving the spent reactor fuel would be expected to reprocess it and store the extracted plutonium under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency, thus insuring that North Korea does not use it for nuclear weapons. </p> <p> In what Western diplomats said was a concession to nationalist sentiment here, the United States has agreed to postpone joint American-Russian military exercises scheduled for early July in Russia. </p> <p> Officials said the Russian Government had requested the postponement, citing nationalist opposition to the presence of American troops on Russian soil. The officials said they hoped the exercises, which have been supported by the Russian Defense Ministry, would take place later and begin in the United States rather than in Russia. </p> <p> Senior Russian officials have dismissed charges by the Clinton Administration that Russia is concealing information about the development and testing of chemical weapons. </p> <p> Last Friday the State Department charged that Russia had broken an agreement  between the two countries to exchange information on their chemical stockpiles. </p> <p> Moving to end one of the most heated disputes still festering between Russia and a former Soviet republic, Moscow formally agreed today to withdraw its remaining 2,000 troops from Estonia by Aug. 31. </p> <p> After months of stalled talks, President Lennart Meri of Estonia and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia compromised on a key stumbling block, the fate of the 10,000 former Soviet officers who are living in retirement in Estonia. </p> <p> Despite prodding from President Clinton, President Boris N. Yeltsin said today that he would not meet a commitment to withdraw all Russian forces from the Baltic countries by Aug. 31. </p> <p> While promising that Latvia would join Lithuania by that date in finally being free of Russian troops, Mr. Yeltsin said he would not pull the remaining 2,000 Russian soldiers out of Estonia until Estonia agreed to grant wider rights to retiring officers who stay. </p> <p> President Clinton told a crowd of 35,000 Latvians today that he will rejoice with them when Russian troops complete their withdrawal from the Baltics by the end of summer, but he also appealed to the Latvians to show more tolerance of the Russian civilians who want to continue living among them. </p> <p> Mr. Clinton's soaring, Jeffersonian oratory hailing Latvia's independence was greeted with cheers, applause and the waving of American flags by the crowd packed into the central Freedom Square in Riga. </p> <p> Five years ago, an inflammatory piece titled "Free the Baltics" appeared in this space. Its theme was that "a great struggle has begun" to dismember the Soviet empire, and I went to the Baltics a few months later to be able to put the message in a dateline redolent with pro-independence propaganda: "Riga, Soviet-occupied Latvia." </p> <p> The three tiny Baltic republics -- Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania -- were the keys to the kingdom. The West had never recognized Stalin's deal with Hitler to swallow up the three states; for a half-century, U.S. Presidents of both parties kept the diplomatic faith with the peoples of these "captive nations" (a phrase derided by anti-anti-Communists here). </p> <p> The United States increased its leading share of arms sales to the third world last year, but overall sales to those countries continued a decline that started at the end of the cold war, the Congressional Research Service reported today. </p> <p> Sales from the United States to third-world countries increased slightly to $14.8 billion in 1993 from $14.6 billion in 1992. But the share of America's sales in that period jumped to 73 percent from 56 percent of all weapons sales and sales agreements. </p> <p> Russia and Germany agreed today to cooperate to prevent the smuggling of nuclear materials by tightening border controls and improving the exchange of information between their intelligence agencies, officials of both countries said. </p> <p> A series of seizures in Germany of bomb-grade nuclear material, including one large shipment of 10.5 ounces of plutonium 239 on a Moscow-Munich flight, prompted three days of talks here between Chancellor Helmut Kohl's intelligence coordinator, Bernd Schmidbauer, and top Russian nuclear and security officials. </p> <p> The German authorities said today that the suspected smuggler of weapons-quality plutonium arrested after flying in from Moscow last week had delivered the first part of what was to be a shipment of four kilograms in a $250-million deal that almost certainly involved members of Russian security services. </p> <p> Undercover investigators negotiated with three members of a criminal group -- two Spaniards and a Colombian who had lived for a long time in Moscow -- and arrested them after receiving the first shipment before any money changed hands, the German authorities said today. </p> <p> Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry said today that there was no plutonium 239 missing from its inventory and no evidence that Russia was the source of any of the plutonium smuggled into Germany. But the German Government immediately challenged the Russian denial, saying Bonn had clear evidence of Russian manufacture for some of the highly enriched, weapons-grade contraband. </p> <p> Germany said three separate shipments of weapons-grade nuclear material from the former Soviet bloc had been seized within the last four months. Last week in Munich, German officials arrested three non-Russian couriers on a flight from Moscow with what the officials said was 300 to 350 grams, or 10.6 to 12.3 ounces, of plutonium 239. Conflicting reports have said the amount was as little as 7 grams and as much as 500 grams. </p> <p> If the collapse of nuclear controls in Russia poses the near-term threat that terrorists could seize plutonium to make nuclear weapons, longer-term fears arise from nuclear energy programs launched by America's closest allies: Japan, Britain and France. </p> <p> Over the next two decades these countries, as well as Russia, plan to vastly increase the world's stockpiles of plutonium. They are producing it to fuel a generation of nuclear power plants whose time has never quite come. </p> <p> Russia has no way of knowing for sure if any of its vast supply of bomb ingredients is missing, many of its own nuclear officials and scientists admit. </p> <p> An investigation of nuclear security in Russia, including interviews with numerous officials and independent experts in Moscow and in Siberia, where many nuclear materials are kept, reveals that the country is far from establishing an effective system for protecting and accounting for the plutonium and highly enriched uranium, the critical ingredients for making nuclear weapons. </p> <p> The German authorities have discovered a second tiny sample of weapons-grade nuclear material that may have been smuggled out of Russia to interest foreign governments or terrorist groups that may want to build atomic bombs, the police said today. </p> <p> They said they had seized the material, 0.028 ounces of highly enriched uranium-235, in June in Landshut, Bavaria, and have since arrested five Czech and Slovak men and a German woman as suspects in what they surmise was an attempt to arrange the sale of a larger amount to someone who wanted to build a bomb. </p> <p> Chancellor Helmut Kohl plans to send an envoy to meet with President Boris N. Yeltsin to discuss ways to prevent an illegal trade in bomb-grade nuclear materials that have been linked to Russia, German officials said today. </p> <p> Concern about the extent of black-market trade in plutonium, the most toxic and potentially destructive materials known to exist, mounted this weekend after the Bavarian police acknowledged that they had found a large amount of plutonium 239 in the baggage of a flight from Moscow at the Munich airport on Wednesday. </p> <p> The German authorities have made another seizure of highly toxic weapon-grade material -- the fourth since May -- believed smuggled out of the former Soviet Union, a prosecutor in the northern city of Bremen said today. </p> <p> A 34-year-old German was arrested there on Friday after reportedly trying to sell a tiny sample, 0.05 milligrams -- a few grains -- of plutonium 239 mixed with other substances to a journalist, who reported the attempt to the authorities, according to Bremen's chief prosecutor, Hans-Georg von Bock und Polach. </p> <p> Federal weapon experts say that the plutonium seized in Germany and suspected of coming from Russia is not of the purity found in military stocks and that the Russians may be right in asserting that the security fences around their sprawling military establishment remain unbreached. </p> <p> However, the experts also say the material, though probably intended as fuel for a nuclear-power reactor, was still potent enough to help make a nuclear bomb, though a crude one by most standards. They view non-weapons establishments in Russia as the most likely source of the leaks, although they say this remains to be proved. </p> <p> German officials said today that the police had made the biggest seizure yet of weapons-quality nuclear materials smuggled from Russia, calling it the most unsettling indication to date of a well-organized criminal conspiracy to provide buyers with the ability to build a bomb. </p> <p> As much as 500 grams, or 17.6 ounces, of highly radioactive plutonium 239, the prime fissionable material of atomic warheads, was seized on Wednesday from baggage from a Lufthansa flight from Moscow at Munich international airport, the officials said. </p> <p> Senior German experts presented evidence to Russian officials here today to support their contention that weapons-grade nuclear materials seized in Germany were produced in the former Soviet Union. </p> <p> In Bonn, the German Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, told a German newspaper that future financial aid to Russia would be linked to cooperation in stopping nuclear smuggling. "I expect other nations to take the same stand," Mr. Waigel was quoted as saying by Bild am Sonntag. </p> <p> Russian atomic-energy officials are investigating three main sites from which they suspect diversions of weapons-usable nuclear materials of the kind recently seized in Germany, American nuclear experts said yesterday. </p> <p> All the sites are in Russia, and all are involved in the production of a fuel for nuclear reactors known as Mox, or mixed oxide fuel, a combination of the oxides of uranium and plutonium. A large shipment of Mox was recently seized in Munich, and has been at the center of a dispute between Germany and Russia over its provenance. </p> <p> In a cordial, almost jocular atmosphere, President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin agreed today to speed destruction of nuclear weapons, but they made only limited progress on several other issues. </p> <p> "Relations between our nations are moving forward at full speed," Mr. Clinton said at a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House after the signing of documents pledging cooperation on economic and security matters. </p> <p> President Clinton has ordered new cuts in the American arsenal of bombers and submarines and will ask President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia to reciprocate with similar reductions at a meeting next week between the two leaders in Washington, Administration officials said today. </p> <p> After completing a 10-month review of nuclear policy, Defense Secretary William Perry announced today that the Administration would cut the number of Trident submarines in the Navy's fleet from 18 to 14 and the number of B-52 strategic bombers from 94 to 66. </p> <p> In an episode that has driven millions of Russians to tears of laughter -- and many others to just plain tears -- the Moscow regional electricity authority severed all power to the nation's Strategic Nuclear Missile Command Center on Wednesday because nobody had bothered to pay the bills. </p> <p> The Odintsovo Central Command Post, 15 miles west of Moscow, which controls one of the largest clusters of nuclear missiles on earth, immediately switched to an emergency fail-safe system for four hours until power was restored. </p> <p> Russian divers have completed the first phase of a deep sea operation to seal holes in a sunken submarine to prevent its corroding nuclear torpedoes from leaking plutonium and other radioactive material into the North Atlantic, the head of the expedition said yesterday. </p> <p> Diving more than a mile under the waves in a pair of manned sub mersibles, the Russian team succeeded in attaching nine large seals to the bow of the submarine, the Komsomolets. The first phase of the expedition began in June and ended in August. The sealing job is to be completed next year. </p> <p> Russian troops stationed near the border of the secessionist Chechen republic were put on top alert today after dozens of people died in the worst fighting yet between the Chechen government and troops opposed to secession. </p> <p> Russia, which refused to recognize the secession three years ago, last month began backing an opposition group, but promised that Russian troops would not intervene. </p> <p> "They would like to spit on this agreement," said the commander of the 14th Russian Army, Lieut. Gen. Aleksandr Lebed, speaking for his troops stationed in the self-declared Trans-Dniester Republic. </p> <p> The agreement, signed on Friday by the Prime Ministers of Moldova and Russia, provides for a three-year phased withdrawal of General Lebed's troops from the region, which is trying to secede from Moldova. </p> <p> United States officials said today that Iraq appeared to have resumed moving troops out of southern Iraq, but President Clinton continued to threaten Saddam Hussein if he fails to follow through on that withdrawal. </p> <p> "They're moving north," said Lieut. Col. David Sims, a Defense Department spokesman. "They're moving past the 32d parallel. But they're not completely across yet." </p> <p> A series of corruption scandals has engulfed and disrupted Russia's previously sacrosanct military establishment, threatening the job of the Defense Minister, Gen. Pavel S. Grachev. </p> <p> Tonight, President Boris N. Yeltsin dismissed a deputy defense minister, Gen. Matvei P. Burlakov, who had commanded the Western Army Group, the ex-Soviet troops based in East Germany, and had been accused in the Russian press along with other Russian officers of the illegal sale of millions of dollars of Government property intended to be brought back to Russia. </p> <p> The deal that brought more than half a ton of bomb-grade uranium from Kazakhstan to the United States required months of delicate three-way negotiations and was made possible only after Washington got Russian approval, Clinton Administration officials said today. </p> <p> Officials said the negotiations began when Kazakh officials approached the American Ambassador to Kazakhstan, William Courtney, in the summer of 1993 and vaguely suggested that they might want Washington to take weapons-grade nuclear material from a nuclear fuel fabrication plant off their hands -- for a price. </p> <p> Speaking today to a conference of top military commanders, President Boris N. Yeltsin expressed unhappiness with their work, urged greater military readiness and said he expected new frictions with the United States under a Congress controlled by the Republican Party. </p> <p> The Russian Government should establish closer ties to the Republicans, Mr. Yeltsin said, "to balance our relations." </p> <p> In the early days of the cold war, explosions and fires at three plants in the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons manufacturing complex killed seven workers and injured a dozen others, a Russian newspaper has reported. </p> <p> Western experts say the disclosures this month by Komsomolskaya Pravda shed light on Soviet efforts to boost nuclear production at all costs and a failure to adequately protect nuclear workers. </p> <p> The Ukrainian Parliament put aside its longstanding reservations and voted overwhelmingly today to make their nation nuclear-free, removing roadblocks to carrying out two major arms control agreements. </p> <p> In a move that the United States eagerly sought for some time, the Parliament agreed to sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, which pledges its signers, with the exception of the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France, to rid themselves of all nuclear weapons. </p> <p> For more than three decades, Russian scientists have disclosed, the Soviet Union and now Russia secretly pumped billions of gallons of atomic waste directly into the earth. They say the practice continues today. </p> <p> Though the Russians defend the practice as safe, it is at odds with accepted global standards for nuclear waste disposal and is contrary to what they have previously said they were doing. The disclosure has set off a debate among experts over the likely consequences of the radioactive injections, which some experts say represent a new kind of nuclear danger that might haunt the planet for centuries. </p> <p> The beleaguered Russian Defense Minister told a skeptical Parliament today that the Russian military was in disastrous shape -- underequipped, underfinanced and losing its ability to defend the motherland. </p> <p> "Not a single army in the world is in such a catastrophic state," said the Defense Minister, Gen. Pavel S. Grachev. "I ask you to take this as a warning." </p> <p> In an extraordinary sign of the Russian military's unhappiness with its mission in the rebellious republic of Chechnya, the commander of a tank division halted his advance about 20 miles from the rebel capital today and promised local villagers that he would not go any further. </p> <p> The officer, Maj. Gen. Ivan Babichev, told weeping Chechen women: "It is forbidden to use the army against peaceful civilians. It is forbidden to shoot at the people." </p> <p> Demoralized and underpaid, the Russian Army is facing in the rebellious Chechnya region its stiffest test of professionalism and morale since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and it is failing the test, Western diplomats and Russian military analysts say. </p> <p> Its officers are rebelling in the face of an increasingly vicious war against other Russians. Its soldiers are dispirited and disorganized, badly fed and cold, without any clear idea of why they should be fighting the Chechens. </p> <p> During the cold war, one of the Central Intelligence Agency's most important jobs was to estimate the Soviet Union's military strength and strategy and share the findings in top-secret reports to the President and selected policy makers. </p> <p> The reports, known as National Intelligence Estimates, are milestones of the arms race, snapshots that chronicled the buildup of nuclear arms as the two superpowers sought peace through ever bigger and more destructive weapons. But with the country they analyzed no longer in existence and the C.I.A. experimenting with a policy of more openness, 80 of those reports from the 1950's through the 1980's were declassified this weekend at Harvard University here during a conference of spies and scholars. </p> <p> In the heart of one of the former Soviet Union's largest missile factories, rocket scientists who once built nuclear weapons aimed at the United States are destroying them with the help of Americans. </p> <p> In the main building, a dilapidated brick structure where the portraits of pioneering Soviet space scientists hang like solemn deities, American defense contractors are working alongside Ukrainian engineers to build a new plant that will vaporize the last drops of fuel from SS-19 missiles. </p> <p> Facing growing public opposition to the war in secessionist Chechnya, President Boris N. Yeltsin said on television tonight that he intended to press forward to seize the rebel capital but that he had ordered a halt to the bombing of civilians there. </p> <p> It was the first time Mr. Yeltsin, who sent tanks and thousands of troops to Chechnya on Dec. 11, spoke up publicly to justify his actions. It was also the first time the Russian Government has admitted attacking civilians in the secessionist republic. </p> <p> Russian troops are still laying siege to Grozny, the capital of secessionist Chechnya, while in Moscow, opponents of the offensive are laying siege to the presidency of Boris N. Yeltsin. </p> <p> And with his popularity in free fall, Mr. Yeltsin took a cautious step in the direction of those who felt most betrayed by his military offensive. </p> <p> Fighting intensified today in a secessionist Muslim region of southern Russia as Russian troops moved to surround and seal off the region's capital. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin ordered troops into the region of Chechnya on Sunday, declaring that they were necessary to defend the unity of the Russian state. The Russian troops have moved toward the capital, Grozny, in three columns while Interior Ministry troops have tried to seal Chechnya's borders, hoping to prevent any new deliveries of arms. </p> <p> As Russian tank divisions continued to tighten their grip on a secessionist region of southern Russia today, opposing delegations met here for a second day of talks aimed at find a way out of the deepening conflict. </p> <p> And in contrast to the repeated gunfire and shelling going on in the breakaway region of Chechnya, less than 20 miles from this small industrial city, the meeting in the art museum here was civilized and cordial. The delegates, in coat and tie, spent their day at a long conference table adorned by giant red roses. </p> <p> The Russian Government, on the eve of a meeting to try to resolve the rebellion in Chechnya, said today that "about 1,000" Chechen fighters were killed Saturday night and today in heavy fighting with Russian troops. </p> <p> The figure could not be confirmed, but such a death toll would be the highest since about 40,000 Russian troops invaded Chechnya on Dec. 11, three years after the mostly Muslim southern republic declared independence from Russia. </p> <p> The Russian military, poised outside the secessionist capital of Grozny, could take the city at any time and is awaiting an order from President Boris N. Yeltsin. But it is uncertain when or if he will give it. </p> <p> The political risks for Mr. Yeltsin are considerable either way. As usual in such moments, his own advisers are divided. </p> <p> The nuclear material recently seized by Czech authorities may be the largest supply of bomb-grade uranium smuggled out of the former Soviet Union, American officials said today. But the officials said that Washington was still awaiting scientific confirmation that the material seized was weapons-grade. </p> <p> According to a preliminary assessment by Prague's Interior Ministry, the shipment confiscated involves 6.6 pounds of highly-enriched uranium 235, which is suitable for making bombs. The nuclear material is believed to have originated in the former Soviet Union. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin appealed today for political unity and parliamentary support for his invasion of the secessionist Chechnya republic. </p> <p> The Russian troops who invaded over the weekend have stopped 15 miles outside Grozny, the capital, after minor clashes. </p> <p> Aleksandr Shevchenko, 75, said he was taking a walk this morning after spending the night in his cellar when the air raid began. </p> <p> "I heard and saw it," he said. "It was terrifying, absolutely terrifying," he added, his body shaking at the memory of the first daylight raid on Grozny since the beginning of the Russian offensive against this secessionist capital. </p> <p> A company whose chairman was once the Secretary of Defense teamed up with a Canadian arms dealer and some enterprising officials in the former Soviet republic of Belarus in a most unusual arms deal, financed in secret by the Pentagon. </p> <p> The deal came to light when the sun rose on Monday morning on a huge Russian-made transport plane parked within sight of an interstate highway in Huntsville, Ala. Its cargo: components of the S-300, the Russian equivalent of the Patriot missile defense system. The buyer: the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's chief military intelligence branch. </p> <p> Russian jets struck the center of this separatist Chechen capital tonight after helicopter gunships and artillery units hit the villages that ring it. </p> <p> The first bombing began late on Sunday as soon as it became clear that negotiations between the Russian Government and the leader of Chechnya, Dzhokhar M. Dudayev, would not continue. </p> <p> Military chiefs of European countries contributing to the United Nations force in Bosnia began two days of discussions here today with American and Russian officials on how to improve the force's ability to protect civilians from the fighting. </p> <p> American officials said that Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, presented a long list of measures to make the force better able to withstand military pressure from the Bosnian Serbs and other parties to the conflict. </p> <p> Russia's armed invasion of Chechnya, the small, fierce Caucasian state that declared independence three years ago, will make this week's visits to Moscow of Vice President Al Gore and Defense Secretary William Perry that much more difficult and delicate. </p> <p> Mr. Gore and Mr. Perry will inevitably try to restore a sense of comity and momentum to a Russian-American relationship that to Washington, at least, suddenly seems to have lost its spark. Similarly, Secretary of State Warren Christopher plans a separate meeting with Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev to "clear the air" after sharp Russian opposition last week to American policy on issues like NATO enlargement, Bosnia and Iraq. </p> <p> President Clinton declined today to criticize Moscow's decision to send hundreds of tanks and thousands of troops to quell an uprising in the southwestern Russian region of Chechnya, saying it was "an internal affair." </p> <p> At a news conference in Miami, where he was attending a summit meeting of leaders from North and South America, Mr. Clinton said: "We hope that order can be restored with a minimum amount of bloodshed and violence. That's what we have counseled and encouraged." </p> <p> President Clinton, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and the heads of three former republics of the Soviet Union exchanged documents today that allow the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, the first arms control agreement intended to reduce strategic nuclear weapons, to come into force. </p> <p> The arms control treaty, signed by Washington and Moscow in 1991, had been delayed from going into effect because of the reluctance of Ukraine to renounce the nuclear weapons it inherited at the break up of the Soviet Union. </p> <p> A 52-nation summit meeting to strengthen security throughout Europe was disrupted today by Russia's opposition to the expansion of NATO and Bosnia's recriminations about the world's failure to end the war in the Balkans. </p> <p> In caustic tones reminiscent of the cold war, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia bluntly told other world leaders in this former Communist capital that NATO was trying to split Europe with its plan to admit members from the former Warsaw Pact and that the United States should not be allowed to dominate the world. </p> <p> As the chaos surrounding the Kremlin deepened, President Boris N. Yeltsin, appearing in public for the first time in more than two weeks, told his National Security Council today that he was prepared to initiate peace talks with Chechnya. At the same time one of his most influential deputies insisted publicly that, if anything, the military assault on Grozny, the Chechen capital, must intensify. </p> <p> After making the overture on peace talks, Mr. Yeltsin then said that the integrity of Russia was at stake and that the fighting in the region would continue as long as it took to subdue the gangsters he said were running Chechnya. He also appointed a new Chechen leader in Moscow. </p> <p> Despite evidence that President Boris N. Yeltsin is losing control of the Russian military, the Clinton Administration has decided that it has little choice but to support him. </p> <p> "This is a time for the United States to be steady and cautious," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said in an interview today. "We need to not rush to judgment or rush to conclusions. It is worth remembering that he is the first elected President of Russia. He has been the exponent of reform, and we are in favor of reform." </p> <p> It is nearly a month since Boris N. Yeltsin ordered Russian troops to put down a secessionist movement in Chechnya. In that time, nothing has seemed to go as planned for the embattled Russian President. Not only has the military failed to crush the ragtag Chechen forces, but Mr. Yeltsin has found himself the subject of the most searing domestic criticism ever leveled against a Kremlin leader. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin is in trouble, and the Chechnya fiasco has provided a good club with which to hammer him. Even his friends in the West have joined in the carping. </p> <p> Making clear its intention to continue an offensive in Chechnya despite domestic and foreign criticism, Russia's National Security Council met here today as the army unleashed its most powerful artillery barrage yet on the capital of the secessionist southern region. </p> <p> As Russian forces pummeled the rebel capital, Grozny, with shells from artillery positioned in several nearby villages, President Boris N. Yeltsin vowed yet again to rein in the furious attack. </p> <p> Warning Chechens to surrender "or be destroyed without mercy," Russian forces pressed deeper into rebel-held sections of this city today as secessionist fighters regrouped in its southern stretches. </p> <p> A thick blanket of snow covering the bombed-out city muffled all but the pounding of artillery and the Russian warnings, which were broadcast by loudspeakers mounted on helicopters. </p> <p> Russian forces moved with new determination today to try to break the back of the Chechen secessionist movement, increasing considerably the rocket and artillery fire directed at the tattered, blasted presidential palace here. For several hours this afternoon, shells were landing every few seconds, with huge explosions and fires visible from a hill near the burning oil refinery. </p> <p> Streets that had been almost busy during a cease-fire that the Russians had declared and often broke were once more nearly empty of traffic. Even the Minutka traffic circle, about a mile and a half from the palace, was being shelled and was mostly free of strolling Chechen fighters with their military regalia and bravado. The Chechen fighters were waiting out the heavy bombardment in basement bunkers as the Russians seemed to be trying to cut off the southern route to the palace along Lenin Prospekt. </p> <p> This grim city was strewn today with scores of dead Russian soldiers, who lay in stacks along the broad, tree-lined boulevards. Wild dogs roamed among them on the streets. Old women locked out of darkened basements wailed in terror, shielding their eyes from the frightening skies above. </p> <p> Although many people have thought it was not possible, the fighting for the Chechen capital keeps worsening. Desperate Russian troops caught inside the city blasted away with tanks, hitting both the presidential palace and the Parliament. Russian rocket attacks were incessant today. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin, trying to put one of the grimmest periods in recent Russian history behind him, said today that the war for Chechnya was effectively at an end. </p> <p> He then dismissed the three most senior Defense Ministry officials who had been critical of the relentless war for the secessionist republic. And in an attempt to prove that he was in control of the Presidency, which has appeared at times to be slipping from his grasp in the past month, Mr. Yeltsin signed a decree transferring a fourth senior officer to duty in the army reserves. </p> <p> After weeks of relentless bombing, shelling and rocket attacks, Russian troops finally smashed the symbol of Chechen resistance today and triumphantly hoisted a Russian flag over the collapsed hulk of the presidential palace in the heart of this besieged city. </p> <p> Chechen fighters who fled the burning palace around 3 A.M. said they had evacuated the Russian prisoners they had been holding inside the building. They vowed to carry on the fight elsewhere in the city and in the hills beyond. </p> <p> In a further sign of growing dissatisfaction with how the divided and demoralized Russian military has handled the military offensive in Chechnya, President Boris N. Yeltsin was reported today to be considering taking over direct control of Russia's armed forces. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin was said to be planning to remove the Russian General Staff from the control of the Defense Ministry and have it report directly to him. The biggest loser in such a radical reorganization could be Mr. Yeltsin's politically embattled Defense Minister, Gen. Pavel S. Grachev, who is widely blamed for bungling the Chechen operation. </p> <p> Growing up amid the quiet farm lands of Grafton, W.Va., David Austin remembers lying on his back in fields near his house, listening and watching for airplanes. </p> <p> He had no idea where they were headed or what kind they were. With a well-developed interest in World War II aircraft and the Korean War still under way, he let his imagination fill in all the necessary blanks. </p> <p> There is blood on the badly scarred walls of 38 Petropavlovskaya Street. It has been there since Wednesday, neighbors said, when Russian special forces troops entered the courtyard and shot two brothers who had been accused of fighting against them. </p> <p> There was no resistance, according to several residents of the charred building who said today that they had seen the shooting. There was only rage and vengeance. Residents of Grozny say Russian soldiers, part of a force that was badly mauled in its early attempts to seize the capital of the secessionist region of Chechnya, have turned increasingly brutal now that they control large tracts of the city. </p> <p> With double-digit monthly inflation, the Chechnya war and some bizarre personnel appointments, Russia has dug itself a pretty deep hole with Western Governments and the International Monetary Fund, which is now debating a $6 billion loan Moscow is counting on. </p> <p> The length and brutality of the Chechnya war, which is not over, have damaged Russia's reputation in the West and undermined political and economic stability here. And the 1995 budget, which has just passed its second reading in Parliament, is based on outdated assumptions and has a big deficit that Moscow is counting on Western financing to fill. </p> <p> One day in September 1993, four months after the F.B.I. had begun its espionage investigation of Aldrich H. Ames, the agents tracking him got their first chance to catch him in an act of spying. But nothing went right. </p> <p> Mr. Ames eluded them twice, once by awakening uncharacteristically early to drop off a message to his Russian contacts and again, later in the day, by escaping a stakeout at the parking lot of the Central Intelligence Agency's headquarters in Langley, Va. -- driving off "like a bat out of hell," one official recalls now. </p> <p> There are essentially two ways to watch the battle for Grozny, which rages on despite all the Russian claims of pacification and victory. </p> <p> One can drive into town in a beat-up old car, as almost all Chechen soldiers do, and hope that nobody stops or shells it. The other way is to hitch a ride in a Russian tank. </p> <p> Acting on a tip from an anonymous female telephone caller, the Prague police swooped down on a smart blue Saab on a crowded shopping street at midday just before Christmas. As they were told they would, the police found highly enriched uranium stashed on the back seat in metal canisters -- 2.7 kilograms, or about 6 pounds' worth. </p> <p> Since the uranium was seized, Czech investigators and Western officials interviewed have determined that the Prague cache was was 87.7 percent uranium-235 in oxide form, and the smugglers were former nuclear workers who knew what they were handling. </p> <p> Efforts to smuggle radioactive materials, including potentially weapons-grade plutonium and uranium, from formerly Communist nations more than doubled last year, a Western European intelligence report says. </p> <p> The report concluded that so far none of the material appeared to have been stolen from nuclear-warhead stocks. </p> <p> China said today that the United States "will increase the danger of nuclear war" and "trigger an arms race in outer space" if it proceeds with a plan to develop an advanced missile defense system that could be deployed around United States forces in Asia. </p> <p> A proposal to build a missile shield covering the United States -- reminiscent of the "Star Wars" program of the Reagan years -- was defeated on Thursday in the House of Representatives. But the Clinton Administration and some members of Congress support the development of a smaller "theater missile defense" system to protect American forces and allies when they are exposed to shorter-range missiles like those Iraq fired against Israel and Saudi Arabia during the Persian Gulf war in 1991. </p> <p> Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican, came out in favor of ratifying the Start-2 arms reduction treaty this week, thereby removing what the Administration had feared could be one of the biggest roadblocks to its quick approval. </p> <p> Administration officials had worried that Mr. Helms, who has opposed many treaties, would use his power as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to delay Start-2. </p> <p> The House of Representatives today approved emergency Pentagon spending of $3.2 billion and decided to pay for it in part by raiding aid to the former Soviet republics and domestic programs dear to Congressional Democrats. </p> <p> The legislation, the first spending bill taken up by the Republican-controlled Congress, won passage on a vote of 262 to 165. It would provide not only some $2.5 billion that the Clinton Administration has requested to pay for recent or current overseas military operations but also $670 million, not requested, which would be earmarked for the training of troops and the purchase of basic military equipment. </p> <p> The Administration is struggling to resolve differences with Russia while leading Republicans threaten to withhold aid unless Moscow cancels a nuclear energy deal with Iran. </p> <p> In recent days, a number of Republicans in Congress have said that Russia's $1 billion deal to build four nuclear reactors would speed Iran's quest for nuclear weapons and that they were prepared to use aid as a weapon to stop it. </p> <p> Acting a little like a suburban clubwoman, Vera Semifragova was cheerily purposeful as she shuffled through lists of names of captured soldiers, counted heads for a bus trip into Chechnya and scolded stragglers. </p> <p> It was only when she spoke the name of her 20-year-old son, Yevgeny, that she began to cry. </p> <p> Who is benefiting the most from the passing of the cold war? Golfers. Cary Schuman, who once hit a golf drive 463 yards and 10 inches (a one-time Guinness world record), has designed a driver made from Russian nuclear missile parts. Some of the profits from the sale of the "Peace Missile" ($299 at 800-721-2060) will go to children's charities in Russia and the United States. Plus, the driver is supposed to really launch the ball. </p> <p> Once again, Moscow has declared premature victory in secessionist Chechnya. If Pyrrhus were a Russian, he would recognize the landscape. </p> <p> In the ninth week of Moscow's offensive, the Russian military has claimed that the capital city, Grozny, is finally taken; Defense Ministry officials say they are ready to withdraw the army and hand over to Interior Ministry troops. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin today defended the offensive in Chechnya before some of his harshest critics in Parliament, but blamed the army leadership for being unprepared and thus responsible for the heavy casualties. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin, in his first lengthy public statement since ordering troops into Chechnya in December, spoke clearly and seemed robust during the hourlong speech. But he named no names, dismissed no commanders for their "failures, setbacks and mistakes in command" and said he would draw no rash judgments. His aides said he would deliver another address on army reform later, perhaps in two months' time. </p> <p> In two days of talks here, the United States and Russia have made no progress in narrowing their differences over Moscow's plans to build four nuclear reactors in Iran, senior Administration officials said today. </p> <p> The Administration vigorously protested the contract during a two-day visit by Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister, Georgi Mamedov. Republicans in Congress are threatening to cut off aid to Moscow unless it cancels the project, which American officials fear will speed Iran's efforts to build nuclear arms. </p> <p> In a fresh effort to persuade President Clinton to come to Moscow for the 50th anniversary of the Allied victory in Europe, President Boris N. Yeltsin said today that he would tailor the Red Square military parade on May 9 to avoid embarrassing the American leader. </p> <p> "He wants to come," Mr. Yeltsin said of Mr. Clinton, but is "a bit concerned about the whole scenario." He said that to make it easier for Mr. Clinton to come for the celebration, the parade in Red Square would be limited to veterans of World War II and no military equipment would be included. </p> <p> Four of the world's main nuclear countries are locked in a dispute as they negotiate a comprehensive ban on nuclear testing: they all want to retain the right to conduct tiny blasts but disagree over the size that should be permitted. </p> <p> The conflict stems from the little-known fact that arms designers can set off nuclear explosions that at their smallest are the equivalent of only a few pounds of TNT. The blasts are useful in checking design calculations and the reliability of existing weapons. </p> <p> The United States failed yesterday to persuade China to end its nuclear cooperation with Iran or to improve its human rights performance, as representatives from 174 countries gathered at the United Nations to decide the fate of a treaty that has limited the spread of nuclear weapons for a quarter of a century. </p> <p> Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, discussed their differences in a two-hour meeting and lunch at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel hours before the start of the monthlong conference to extend the 25-year-old nuclear treaty. </p> <p> The United Nations dismissed a Russian general today from its peacekeeping force in Croatia, accusing him of incompetence, poor leadership and connivance with Russia's traditional allies, the Serbs. </p> <p> The decision to dismiss Maj. Gen. Aleksandr Perelyakin brought furious protests from Russian officials at the United Nations and a defiant statement from the Defense Ministry in Moscow, which said the general remained at his post. </p> <p> Administration officials disclosed today that Russia's top atomic energy official promised Iran in January that Moscow would sell equipment to Iran that could be used to prepare material suitable for an atomic bomb. </p> <p> The Administration learned three weeks ago about Moscow's commitment and since then, Washington has implored Russia to drop the plan, saying it jeopardizes American economic aid to Russia. </p> <p> China, publicly breaking ranks with the other acknowledged nuclear-weapons powers, said today that it could back an extension of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty for either an indefinite period or a series of fixed periods of no less than 25 years' duration. </p> <p> The other four nuclear-weapons powers -- the United States, Britain, France and Russia -- are lobbying for an indefinite and unconditional extension of the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which came into force in 1970 and is due for renewal this year. They argue that any other outcome would weaken the treaty. </p> <p> President Clinton tonight repeated his vow to oppose the welfare overhaul passed by the House of Representatives as too harsh on children, and called on Congress to pass by the Fourth of July a comprehensive bill that would put the poor to work and provide greater flexibility for states. </p> <p> In his first prime-time news conference in more than eight months, Mr. Clinton also said he was ready 'to go to the mat" for his nomination of Dr. Henry W. Foster Jr. as Surgeon General despite a warning by Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, that he might not bring the nomination up for a vote. </p> <p> Seven months after Russia completed its military withdrawal from the Baltics, Latvia is still home to more than 1,600 officers who were in effect retired when Moscow demobilized their units before the pullout. </p> <p> Their continued presence has stirred fears among some Latvians that Russia is keeping the former officers here as a fifth column, although Moscow says they will leave by the end of this year. </p> <p> President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin struggled today to find common ground in anticipation of their summit meeting next month in Moscow, papering over some disputes, ignoring others, and resolving none of them. </p> <p> Their 30-minute telephone conversation was cordial but vague, underscoring strains between the United States and Russia that American officials made no effort to hide. Senior American officials acknowledged that Mr. Clinton did not even raise the most serious issue dividing Washington and Moscow: Russia's $1 billion deal to build two nuclear energy reactors for Iran, which the United States wants canceled. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration has taken the unusual step of providing Russian officials with American intelligence on Iran in hopes of persuading them to drop Russia's project to build nuclear reactors in Iran. </p> <p> American officials said the written intelligence report shared with the Russians shows that Iran has a crash program to build nuclear weapons that would be accelerated by Russia's $1 billion contract to build up to four reactors in Iran. </p> <p> Secretary of Defense Perry said today that American aid to Russian military conversion programs should continue, despite the fierce opposition by the United States to the Russian plan to build nuclear reactors for Iran. </p> <p> "We cannot put other programs, which are very, very important to us, at hostage every time we have a disagreement," Mr. Perry said after touring a Russian defense plant in Moscow that is beginning to produce hearing aids in a joint venture agreement with an American company. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration has repeatedly warned Moscow in recent months that unless it cancels a project to build nuclear reactors in Iran, the United States will drop plans for nuclear cooperation that Russia badly wants, senior Administration officials said today. </p> <p> This past week, Russian officials brushed aside these warnings and insisted that they would go ahead with the reactor project. But Administration officials said they hoped the warnings, together with a growing campaign of pressure and inducements, would persuade Russia to announce plans to cancel the Iranian deal when President Clinton visits Moscow in May. </p> <p> The Russian Government made clear today that it would go ahead with the sale of light-water nuclear reactors to Iran over fierce American protests, repeated here by the visiting Defense Secretary, William J. Perry. </p> <p> Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin shares American concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions, Mr. Perry said in a news conference this evening, and agreed to arrange meetings of Russian and American experts concerned about the spread of nuclear weapons and the transfer of nuclear technology to Iran. </p> <p> For a quarter of a century, a relatively simple treaty of fewer than 50 paragraphs has served as the touchstone of all international efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons and to prevent peaceful nuclear projects from being used in destructive ways. </p> <p> Now the 1968 accord, the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, is up for renewal, 25 years after it took effect, in 1970. </p> <p> Two weeks before a summit meeting in Moscow between Presidents Clinton and Boris N. Yeltsin, Russia's Foreign Minister today cautioned the Administration and Congress against pursuing plans for a new short-range missile defense system. He said moving ahead with such plans could slow progress on disarmament agreements and undermine a fragile new Russian-American partnership. </p> <p> The missile defense system has been the subject of several recent meetings between the two sides in which American officials have tried to meet some Russian concerns before the summit meeting takes place. </p> <p> The Federal Bureau of Investigation has searched its files and found no credible evidence to support charges that the architects of the atom bomb betrayed the United States a half century ago by spying for Moscow, and in fact has secret evidence to the contrary. </p> <p> The F.B.I.'s conclusion, made public by the White House Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board on Monday, appears to be the first time the bureau has sought to clear a scientist accused of treason. </p> <p> After a pitched battle between French peacekeepers and Bosnian Serbs, France and its NATO allies renewed diplomatic efforts today to stop the violence and asked Russia to help persuade the Serbs to free United Nations troops seized as hostages. </p> <p> Although more than 150 French troops were among the 220 surrounded or held as human shields, France did not publicly repeat earlier threats to withdraw its three battalions from Bosnia. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration's foreign policy came under sharp criticism on two fronts in Congress today. </p> <p> Senate Republicans lambasted it for not being tough enough toward Russia, while several House Democrats joined their Republican colleagues in attacking new policies on Cuban immigration. </p> <p> At a vast construction site baked by the sun and buffeted by the salty Persian Gulf air, two partly built nuclear reactors are frozen in time. </p> <p> For the Iranians, the enormous steel and concrete structures represent what might have been and what might be, a symbol of their legal right to develop nuclear energy and of their potential to become a great regional power. </p> <p> An Iranian official said today that Teheran would not keep spent fuel from Russian-made atomic reactors that could serve as raw material for nuclear bombs, raising the possibility that Teheran and Moscow are trying to make the deal more palatable to the United States. </p> <p> The official, Mohammed Sadegh Ayatollahi, who is Iran's envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, said in New York today that Iran would return the spent fuel rods to Russia, a move apparently designed to reassure Western countries worried that Iran planned to separate the plutonium for possible use in a nuclear bomb. </p> <p> European security officials said today that the leader of the separatist rebels in the southern region of Chechnya has agreed to take part in direct peace talks with representatives of the Russian Government in Grozny later this week. </p> <p> A spokeswoman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, speaking in Vienna, said all parties -- Russians, Chechen separatists, and Chechens allied with Russia -- have received invitations and agreed to attend talks. The organization has tried for six months to halt the war in Chechnya. </p> <p> President Clinton and his top advisers know exactly what they would like to get out of next week's meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. The trouble, as the advisers concede, is that they no longer see much chance of getting it. </p> <p> Instead, the White House is portraying the one-day meeting as an endeavor in personal diplomacy. Even after months of American prodding on issues ranging from the war in Chechnya to Russia's nuclear accord with Iran, Administration officials say that all they are sure the meeting can achieve is that Mr. Clinton will present that case to Mr. Yeltsin in person. </p> <p> More than 170 nations agreed today to extend in perpetuity a treaty that has limited the spread of nuclear arms for a quarter of a century. </p> <p> The Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, a bedrock agreement in Soviet-American relations that arose in the midst of the cold war, became permanent today by acclamation. </p> <p> The original treaty, which went into effect in 1970, had to be reviewed this year, to decide whether it should be extended for a set period, ended, or prolonged indefinitely. The treaty basically limits nuclear weapons to the five states that had proclaimed them at the time -- the United States, Britain, France, China and the Soviet Union, now Russia. All other signers had to promise not to acquire them. </p> <p> President Clinton came to this capital today to begin a two-day celebration of Ukraine's striking new willingness to surrender its nuclear weapons and embrace a market economy. </p> <p> With frictions between the United States and Ukraine over those issues now fading, the White House was unabashed in casting Mr. Clinton's visit as a tribute to the strides taken here by President Leonid Kuchma, who won election last July. </p> <p> The leaders of Russia and Ukraine signed an agreement today that should conclude their bitter dispute over the Black Sea Fleet, improving relations between the two most important countries of the former Soviet Union. </p> <p> The issue of the old Soviet fleet and naval base at Sevastopol, Crimea, has done much to fan nationalist tensions between Moscow and Kiev since the Soviet Union died in 1991. </p> <p> The Senate Energy Committee sought today to save an East-West deal in which Russian nuclear warheads are to be turned into a peaceful bonanza, even as a businessman testified that the first phase of the venture had gone relatively smoothly and the Administration said any flaws that might endanger the deal could be straightened out. </p> <p> "We do not believe that this agreement is in serious jeopardy," Charles B. Curtis, Undersecretary of Energy, told the committee. </p> <p> More than 250 miles out in the Indian Ocean, Capt. Kizhupalli Mohanan of the Indian Navy leaned out from an observation deck aboard the Abraham Lincoln, straining to catch a view of an F-14 Tomcat fighter as it screamed down over a cobalt-blue sea toward one of the newest nuclear-powered American aircraft carriers. </p> <p> For Captain Mohanan, a grizzle-bearded navy pilot with hundreds of carrier landings behind him, there was little of the first-timer's thrill in the full-throttle roar of the Tomcat's engines and the cracking impact of the 30-ton fighter hitting the deck one. </p> <p> In another indication of Russian military ineptitude and lack of coordination, Russian troops failed twice today in separate assaults to take the hospital complex where Chechen fighters held as many as 2,000 hostages. </p> <p> Russian officials said negotiations with the Chechen fighters had resumed once again as the main hospital building was burning. </p> <p> The leaders of the seven major industrial nations issued a double-pronged warning today to President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, telling him that the "situation in Chechnya should not be resolved by military means" and indirectly condemning his Government's planned sale of nuclear reactors to Iran. </p> <p> In remarks to reporters before he and President Clinton met for private talks, an obviously agitated Mr. Yeltsin pronounced Chechnya "the center of world terrorism, of bribery and corruption and mafia." </p> <p> Three years after Russia agreed to provide the United States with uranium from scrapped Russian nuclear weapons, the deal is unraveling, prompting a quiet struggle to save the accord, Federal and private experts say. </p> <p> Russia was to get $12 billion in desperately needed hard currency, and the United States was to get 500 metric tons of bomb-grade uranium, which was to be diluted to make fuel for American nuclear power plants and ultimately electricity for consumers. </p> <p> In what served as a rebuke to the Chechen rebel leader's renewed demand for independence, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia issued a decree today ordering Russian military units to be permanently stationed in Chechnya. </p> <p> Moscow has said all along that it planned to keep troops in Chechnya if and when a political settlement to the conflict there is reached. In exchange for a substantive withdrawal of troops, Chechen negotiators had tentatively agreed to return to what was the military status quo before the war. But the timing of the decree, set against new obstacles in the peace talks, mainly seemed aimed at reasserting Russian authority over the secessionist region. </p> <p> Moving decisively to reshape his Government before an important parliamentary challenge on Saturday, President Boris N. Yeltsin announced tonight that he was dismissing the ministers of Security, the Interior, and Nationalities for their failures in responding to a hostage-taking by Chechen rebels in southern Russia. </p> <p> It was the most serious Government shake-up since the Soviet Union collapsed at the end of 1991, and it represents something of a gamble for Mr. Yeltsin. He is removing most of the so-called power ministers, whose ministries were involved in the failed August 1991 coup against President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union. </p> <p> The American intelligence establishment today unveiled one of its oldest secrets: how a small team of code-breakers found the first clues that the Soviet Union sought to steal the blueprints for the atomic bomb in World War II. </p> <p> Using just brain power -- no computers, no stolen skeleton keys -- the cryptographers slowly cracked what was thought to be an unbreakable code. They painstakingly turned gibberish into powerful evidence of a Soviet spy ring whose ranks included Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. </p> <p> The American intelligence establishment today unveiled one of its oldest secrets: how a small team of code-breakers found the first clues that the Soviet Union sought to steal the blueprints for the atomic bomb in World War II. </p> <p> Using just brain power -- no computers, no stolen skeleton keys -- the cryptographers slowly cracked what was thought to be an unbreakable code. They painstakingly turned gibberish into powerful evidence of a Soviet spy ring whose ranks included Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. </p> <p> Major progress has been made in repairing an East-West deal in which the nuclear material from thousands of Russian warheads is to be transformed into a peaceful bonanza of nuclear energy, Federal officials say. But private experts assert that the undertaking is still in doubt and might fall apart. </p> <p> The deal, hammered out three years ago after the Soviet Union collapsed, would have the United States pay Russia $12 billion for diluting 500 metric tons of bomb-grade uranium from nuclear arms into reactor fuel that would be used for generating electricity in America. The deal was hailed as a significant step in reducing the risk that bomb ingredients could be stolen in Russia and sold to terrorists or to countries seeking to develop a bomb. </p> <p> A plan by the Federal Government to sell the operations that produce fuel for the nation's nuclear power plants -- the largest privatization ever attempted by Washington -- has long been counted on to demonstrate commitment to leaner government. But with the White House ready to announce details of the sale this week, a debate is raging over whether such a sale would do more harm than good. </p> <p> The central question is one familiar whenever a government sells off a chunk of itself: would a private owner's financial interests be at odds with the national interest? </p> <p> After a debate that evoked memories of the cold war years, the Senate moved ahead today with plans to revive a version of President Reagan's "Star Wars" program, beating back attempts by Democrats to eliminate money and authorization for a land-based national defense against long-range missiles. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration and Senate Democrats say the plan would violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, a cornerstone of American arms control policy, and rekindle cold war tensions with Russia. </p> <p> NATO diplomats said today that a committee was making progress on resolving the issue of how countries from outside the alliance could take part in any military operation to enforce a peace settlement in Bosnia. </p> <p> The United States wants NATO in command of any such operation as a condition to sending up to 25,000 American soldiers to Bosnia -- about half the estimated force -- to take part in it. </p> <p> Seeking to turn what they called an international humiliation into a domestic campaign issue, nationalists, Communists and some moderates in the Russian Parliament today demanded that President Boris N. Yeltsin suspend Russia's cooperation agreement with NATO because of its bombing of the Bosnian Serbs over Russia's objections. </p> <p> In a special session of the lower house called to consider Russia's position on Bosnia, the legislators passed a nonbinding resolution that called for Russia to suspend the NATO agreement and demanded the dismissal of Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev. </p> <p> In a concession intended to reduce tensions with Moscow, the United States and its NATO allies decided today to permit Russia to keep more tanks and artillery pieces in the Caucasus region than would be allowed under a 1990 treaty. </p> <p> American officials said a NATO commission made the decision in Brussels because of fears that tensions could mushroom and the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe could fall apart. Russia has threatened to flout new restrictions that take effect on Nov. 17. </p> <p> The Defense Department has found a new mission: to make it easier for Russia and China to improve their nuclear arsenals and to help other countries build advanced weapons. This will happen if the Pentagon wins a quiet debate over exporting supercomputers, the most powerful instruments used to develop high-tech weapons. </p> <p> Federal officials who oppose this effort say the Pentagon is urging the White House to adopt greatly reduced controls on exporting supercomputers not only to Russia and China, but also to India, Israel and Pakistan, which have not signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and are widely believed to be building nuclear warheads. </p> <p> President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin have agreed that up to 2,000 Russian soldiers may carry out support functions in Bosnia to back up a peace agreement, senior NATO and Administration officials said yesterday. </p> <p> Such troops would be separate from a NATO-led force that would enforce a settlement. </p> <p> In an elaborate face-saving solution, the noncombat soldiers Russia has agreed to contribute to a Bosnian peacekeeping force would serve under Gen. George Joulwan in his capacity as American commander, rather than NATO commander, under the terms of an agreement announced here today. </p> <p> General Joulwan, who is based in Brussels, wears two hats -- that of commander of American forces in Europe and that of NATO's top commander. For the Russian operation, a Russian officer, Gen. Leonti P. Shevtsov, would serve as the American general's deputy. </p> <p> In an elaborate face-saving solution, the noncombat soldiers Russia has agreed to contribute to a Bosnian peacekeeping force would serve under Gen.

Yeltsin's doctors said today that the Russian leader, in the hospital after an episode of heart disease on Thursday, must remain under "close medical supervision" through the end of November but that he is conscious and his condition is stable. </p> <p> Kremlin officials today canceled a meeting scheduled for Tuesday in Moscow with the Presidents of Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia before they travel to the United States to begin peace talks. Mr. Yeltsin has been pushing for a Moscow meeting on Bosnia to underline Russia's importance in the search for peace there. </p> <p> President Boris N.

The M-55 Geophysika is roughly equivalent in purpose and performance to America's U-2 reconnaissance plane, which has been renamed the ER-2 and flies research missions for NASA. </p> <p> For the first time since the end of the cold war, a Russian high-altitude spy plane has been put at the disposal of Western European scientists, who will use it to study depletion of the protective ozone layer over Arctic regions. </p> <p> The European Science Foundation announced this month that Russia would provide a specially modified Myasishchev M-55 airplane for high-altitude Arctic studies during the winter and spring months of 1996 to 1998.

Mirzayanov, reported in 1991 that Moscow was secretly developing and testing chemical weapons after publicly renouncing them, and he was imprisoned twice -- in 1992 and 1994 -- for writing about the weapons program. </p> <p> Russia has decided to allow seven military-industrial companies to export arms directly, bypassing the state arms monopoly, reports said today. </p> <p> The Interfax news agency said the companies would be cleared to seek foreign  contracts following a decision on Wednesday by a committee on military-industrial policy, headed by First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg N. Soskovets. </p> <p> President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin emerged from a meeting today lavishly stressing the stability of the American-Russian relationship. But they made only limited progress in finding a formula to integrate Russian troops into a peacekeeping force for Bosnia. </p> <p> Instead, as they ended more than four hours of talks at the estate of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the two leaders emphasized that they were committed to a solution and had instructed their military strategists to keep searching for a command structure that both could live with. </p> <p> President Clinton and President Boris N.

Yeltsin dismissed a general overseeing Russia's military budget today and barred power companies from cutting off lights, heat and phones at military bases that do not pay their bills. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin issued the orders in two separate decrees from the Moscow hospital where he is recovering from an episode of heart disease. He also held talks there with the Defense Minister, Gen. Pavel S. Grachev on NATO, the rebel  Chechnya region and Bosnia and Herzegovina. </p> <p> Barely suppressing their mutual distaste, three Balkan Presidents came together today at an American military base for ambitious peace talks aimed at ending four years of terror and bloodshed in Bosnia. </p> <p> It was the first time the three men -- Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia -- have met face to face since they held a series of unsuccessful meetings in Yugoslavia in 1991 on the eve of the country's division and disintegration into war. Thus just bringing them into the same room represented a considerable achievement. </p> <p> Russia failed to meet its commitments to reduce its military presence in two  regions by a treaty deadline Friday night, and Western nations were working with Russia to seek a compromise, diplomats said today. </p> <p> Russia did not meet conditions called for in a NATO-Warsaw Pact treaty to reduce troops and weapons in the Caucasus and around St. Petersburg, but met other terms. </p> <p> Russia and the United States agreed today on a face-saving way to allow about a thousand Russian combat troops to take part in a NATO peacekeeping force in Bosnia without reporting directly to NATO. Instead, the troops will serve with an American division. </p> <p> Defense Secretary William J. Perry and Gen. Pavel S. Grachev, the Russian Defense Minister, agreed in talks at NATO headquarters here that two or three infantry battalions could take part in the peacekeeping force this way without technically taking orders from NATO. </p> <p> Issuing a major policy statement on arms control, China tonight sharply rebuked the United States, Russia, Britain and France for continuing to develop  "nuclear weapons and outer space weapons, including guided missile defense systems," while seeking in some cases to deny the peaceful use of nuclear technology to the developing world. </p> <p> Missile parts being smuggled to Iraq that were intercepted by Jordanian authorities last month were Russian-made guidance components valued at $25 million, a senior Jordanian official said today. </p> <p> The Jordanian attributed his information to the United Nations commission that is overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. A United Nations official in New York declined to give details of the goods but said they were part of an "ongoing pattern of procurement" of weapons that Iraq  is banned from having. </p> <p> Missile parts being smuggled to Iraq that were intercepted by Jordanian authorities last month were Russian-made guidance components valued at $25 million, a senior Jordanian official said today. </p> <p> The Jordanian attributed his information to the United Nations commission that is overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. A United Nations official in New York declined to give details of the goods but said they were part of an "ongoing pattern of procurement" of weapons that Iraq  is banned from having. </p> <p> The top Russian commander in Chechnya said today that about 600 people, half  of them civilians, had been killed in a week of fighting with rebels in Chechnya's second-largest city. </p> <p> Russian troops have kept the city, Gudermes, sealed off since Saturday, preventing civilians from fleeing the fighting and relief workers from entering  the city. The figures are considerably higher than earlier estimates and confirm suspicions of heavy casualties in during the Russian effort to recapture the city from the rebels. </p> <p> Stung by perceived humiliations in its relationship with Washington, Russia is pushing a more energetic Asian policy, deepening relations with China, its onetime ally and longtime rival. </p> <p> Russian officials deny that any kind of joint policy is in the making against the United States, as in the 1950's. They say such a policy now would contradict Moscow's foreign-policy aims and Beijing's vow to avoid new alliances. </p> <p> In somber silence, the leaders of Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia signed a peace agreement today, even as scattered violence in Bosnia made clear that real peace was not yet at hand. </p> <p> Today's ceremony, presided over by President Clinton and other international  sponsors, cleared the way for the deployment of 60,000 NATO peacekeeping troops  and the commitment of hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild the country after nearly four cruel years of war. </p> <p> The Russians came today, only 150 of them, but it was a historic occasion, the first time Russian and American soldiers have been in the same European theater of operations as allies since fighting Nazi Germany together. </p> <p> Reflecting the lingering uneasiness after 40 years of cold war, a complex system has been established for the Russian role in the Bosnian peacekeeping operation. </p> <p> United States intelligence services, forced to cooperate with one another and with their Russian counterparts in the muddy fields of Bosnia, are creating an espionage network of dozens of spies, electronic-eavesdropping devices and sophisticated computer systems. </p> <p> The choreography among the American intelligence services, the cross-fertilization of their information and its availability to soldiers in the field are equally unusual -- "unprecedented," said an admiral and a general, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. </p> <p> Austria's leadership demanded today that the United States supply details of  79 secret American arsenals that remain scattered across Austria more than 40 years after they were hidden in case of a Soviet invasion. </p> <p> The American Ambassador to Austria, Swanee Hunt, told Chancellor Franz Vranitzky on Saturday that the United States had stockpiled the weapons as an occupation power in the early 1950's without notifying the Austrian Government. </p> <p> Today, three years after President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin signed a major strategic arms reduction treaty, Start II, the Senate approved it, 87 to 4. </p> <p> But the treaty, which would cut the number of nuclear warheads held by both countries by 50 percent, may be dead, some senior American officials fear. The current Russian legislature, elected on Dec. 17, is significantly more opposed to Mr. Yeltsin than the old one, and it may prove impossible to get the necessary votes there to approve the treaty as written. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration is scrambling to fend off accusations that it cannot verify whether Moscow is cheating on a deal that was central to ending the cold war -- the purchase by the United States of enriched uranium from thousands of Russian nuclear warheads. </p> <p> The doubts center on whether the Russians are indeed dismantling weapons, as  agreed, or are supplying the uranium from other sources, like stockpiles or continued production. </p> <p> The United States Ambassador, Swanee Hunt, handed over an envelope today giving the location and contents of 79 arms caches the Americans set up in Austria in the early 1950's. </p> <p> The weapons were stockpiled across western Austria -- the zone of American occupation after World War II -- and were meant for anti-Communist partisans in  the event of a Soviet invasion. </p> <p> ASA BASAYEV BELIEVES she saw him. "I remember him because he was very big and a little bit heavy," she said. We were standing on the front steps of the burned-out municipal building in Samashki, a small agricultural town in war-battered western Chechnya, and Basayev, an elderly woman with piercing gray  eyes, was pointing toward the debris-strewn main street. "I saw him passing right by here," she said. I had come to Samashki, or what was left of it, with a small entourage -- a driver, a photographer and a translator -- and a question: What happened to Fred Cuny? </p> <p> At the time of my conversation with Basayev, in early November, it had been seven months since Cuny, perhaps America's preeminent disaster-relief specialist, and three of his colleagues had disappeared in Chechnya -- and nearly three months since the international efforts to find them had been called off. They were presumed dead. The manhunt, one of the most extraordinary in recent times, had not uncovered where they had been killed or why. </p> <p> Over the past five years, the United States policy of steady engagement with  Russia has paid benefits to the American people. With our help, the Russians have dismantled thousands of nuclear warheads and rocket launchers. Russian troops, having withdrawn from Germany and the Baltic states, are serving alongside their NATO counterparts in Bosnia. The United States is now the largest foreign investor in Russia, and bilateral trade has nearly tripled in the past three years. </p> <p> When Secretary of State Warren Christopher meets with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov in Helsinki this week, he will stress America's determination to preserve and, where possible, to deepen and broaden these accomplishments. He will also discuss some issues on which we have differences,  such as Russia's intention to sell nuclear reactors to Iran. </p> <p> The Senate's ratification of the Start II treaty is supposedly a sign that the United States respects its nuclear disarmament commitments and that it intends to push Russia to do the same. But many in Moscow think the real objective is to disarm Russia as soon as possible. </p> <p> The problem is the American double standard: a demand for disarmament while disrupting the balance of power by pushing NATO's ill-conceived plans to march toward Russia. </p> <p> Russia and China have secretly concluded a broad agreement to upgrade the Chinese Air Force by completing the long-stalled sale of 72 high-performance SU-27 fighter planes to Beijing as a prelude to licensing the production of Russia's premier supersonic warplane in China. </p> <p> Chinese military leaders have been pressing the Government for some time to finance a major upgrading of air and naval forces. The deal reflects the growing influence of the Chinese military in the competition for scarce budget resources. </p> <p> Plutocrats of the world, you have nothing more to lose in Russia if a Communist is elected President than you do already under the unpredictable incumbent, Boris N. Yeltsin. </p> <p> That was the message the Russian Communist Party leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, brought to business and political leaders from around the globe in this Alpine ski resort over the weekend. </p> <p> The United States is "very poorly" equipped to defend itself against a terrorist group armed with nuclear, biological or chemical weapons, the Director of Central Intelligence, John M. Deutch, testified today. </p> <p> "The ability of our country or, I might say, any other country in the developed world to protect their infrastructure from a terrorist attack based on nuclear, chemical or biological weapons is very, very small indeed," he told a Senate Armed Services subcommittee. </p> <p> Russia has cut the number of troops it has on the South Kuril Islands, a chain seized by Russia after World War II but still claimed by Japan, to about 3,500, Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov said today. </p> <p> The disclosure came during President Boris N. Yeltsin's meeting with the Japanese Foreign Minister, Yukihiko Ikeda, who was in Moscow to demonstrate support for the Russian President and his reforms. </p> <p> The republics of the former Soviet Union cannot account for a large share of  the hundreds of tons of bomb-grade uranium and plutonium once listed in their stockpiles, creating a "primary national security concern for the United States," Government investigators are warning in a new report. </p> <p> The investigators say that the nuclear material is an easy target for smugglers and terrorists, given the lax security procedures at scores of civilian and military nuclear sites throughout the former Soviet Union, and that the United States has little ability to track the material if it is stolen. </p> <p> Senator Bob Dole called today for the resurrection of plans to build a national missile defense system by 2003. The system would cost billions of dollars and would violate a treaty on anti-ballistic missiles between Washington and Moscow. </p> <p> Mr. Dole, Speaker Newt Gingrich and other leading Congressional Republicans introduced a bill today to build such a system in seven years, saying it was vital to the nation's defense. </p> <p> Lieut. Col. Jeff Hammond, the commander of the 429th Field Artillery, First Armored Division, peered into the empty hatch of a Russian armored personnel carrier. </p> <p> "You airdrop soldiers while they are inside the vehicle?" the American said incredulously to the Russian commanding officer. "You're kidding!" </p> <p> Russia today endorsed a global treaty to ban underground nuclear tests, but stopped short of supporting the West's goal of banning even the tiniest release  of nuclear energy. </p> <p> "Russia has been consistently in favor of a complete and general nuclear test ban," the Russian delegate, Grigory Berdennikov, said in his first speech this year to the 38-member forum. </p> <p> The Navy machinist's mate arrested in Orlando, Fla., this week on charges of  military espionage had approached Russian officials in an effort to sell classified submarine information, officials said today. </p> <p> The Federal Bureau of Investigation, in announcing the arrest of Kurt G. Lessenthien, 29, of Orlando, said on Tuesday that he had been arrested by a Federal agent posing as a representative of a foreign government. </p> <p> President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin emerged from a meeting in the Kremlin today effusively celebrating the American-Russian partnership even as they glossed over a host of policy differences. </p> <p> They announced some progress on disputes over treaties on conventional forces and anti-missile defenses. And both men put a premium on keeping the relationship between the United States and Russia on a solid footing despite growing anti-Western sentiment in Russia and a coming presidential election here that could well return a resurgent Communist Party to power. </p> <p> If the leaders of the world's richest countries had the slightest doubts about what has been on President Boris N. Yeltsin's mind lately, they disappeared Friday night at a sumptuous private dinner at the Kremlin Grand Palace. </p> <p> Squirming in their seats as they washed down their fish pasties, black caviar, stuffed pike and wild goose with fine wine and Russian vodka, seven heads of state listened to Mr. Yeltsin deliver a rambling 45-minute monologue on himself and his prospects for re-election this June. </p> <p> Concluding their summit meeting, President Boris N. Yeltsin and the leaders of major industrialized nations called today for a speedy enactment of a nuclear test ban and announced measures to stop the smuggling of nuclear bomb ingredients. </p> <p> But the session was also noteworthy for its warm embrace of the embattled Mr. Yeltsin, who is running for re-election in June, although President Clinton was  careful not to declare his preference for Mr. Yeltsin openly. [Page 10.] </p> <p> The people of the Chechen flatlands have developed a routine in the weeks since President Boris N. Yeltsin announced his initiative to end the war in this secessionist region in southern Russia. </p> <p> They get up at dawn to watch the Russian bombers drop their deadly cargo in the mountains to the south. Then they wait for the heavy artillery to ring across the misty valleys of the region. Then they pray. </p> <p> The first steps in executing a new international agreement to control trade in conventional weapons have been slowed by Russia, which wants to limit the agreement. </p> <p> Delegates from 31 countries, including the United States, convened here on Tuesday for what was to have been the first plenary session to form a group to supervise the agreement, define its duties, appoint a secretariat and discuss sources for its budget. </p> <p> In a secret project reminiscent of the chilliest days of the cold war, Russia is building a mammoth underground military complex in the Ural Mountains, Western officials and Russian witnesses say. </p> <p> Hidden inside Yamantau mountain in the Beloretsk area of the southern Urals,  the project involves the construction of a huge complex served by a railroad, a  highway and thousands of workers. </p> <p> When scientists from the Kurchatov Institute go to work at Building 116, getting in the door is no simple matter. </p> <p> First, they slide computerized identification cards into a cage-like booth at the entranceway. Then they punch in a secret code, while a computer determines their weight to verify their identity. </p> <p> When President Boris N. Yeltsin declared on Thursday, somewhat prematurely as it turned out, that he had persuaded China to sign a treaty banning nuclear weapons testing forever, he was unaware of China's position on the "asteroid threat" and the need for "peaceful nuclear explosions" to combat it. </p> <p> The Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, told Mr. Yeltsin that China favored concluding a treaty this year. On the basis of his statement, Mr. Yeltsin announced what he thought was very good news, especially after President Clinton had personally requested that he try to win Chinese support for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. </p> <p> Worried by information that China was seeking to buy SS-18 strategic missile  technology from Russia or Ukraine, the United States has recently warned all three countries against such a sale, Defense Secretary William J. Perry said today. </p> <p> Senior American officials said there has been no evidence of any completed sales or transfers of SS-18 missiles or components, including guidance canisters or propellant, from either Russia or Ukraine to China. And Russia and Ukraine have said that no transfer occurred. </p> <p> In a political purge, President Boris N. Yeltsin today dismissed seven senior generals with ties to the ousted Defense Minister, Gen. Pavel S. Grachev. </p> <p> The dismissals were intended to polish Mr. Yeltsin's image as a reformer and  strengthen the authority of Aleksandr I. Lebed, a former election rival of Mr. Yeltsin who was recently named his national security adviser. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin has ordered Russia's Central Bank to transfer the  equivalent of $1 billion to the federal budget in an election-year move that has alarmed economists and created new worries about resurgent inflation </p> <p> Facing a strong Communist challenge in presidential elections just two weeks  away, Mr. Yeltsin said the funds would be used to fulfill campaign promises to teachers, doctors and the military. </p> <p> In a bold stroke to consolidate support before next month's runoff election,  President Boris N. Yeltsin dismissed his unpopular Defense Minister today and appointed Aleksandr I. Lebed, a retired general who finished a strong third in Sunday's first round, as his top national security adviser. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin's move tightened his grip on first place by giving him a claim to the 15 percent of the electorate who supported the gruff-talking Mr. Lebed in the first round of presidential balloting. </p> <p> The leaders of the seven largest industrial democracies and Russia endorsed a 40-point plan today to combat crime and terrorism that would, if fully carried out, give the police far freer rein to pursue criminals abroad. </p> <p> The plan, disclosed at the 22d annual summit meeting of the Group of Seven countries, would allow the United States and other countries to post investigators on foreign soil and would require the seven allies to crack down on the import and export of firearms. </p> <p> Russia has agreed to freeze the number of its conventional forces now deployed on its European borders and to meet its obligations under a 1990 arms reduction treaty within three years, United States and European officials said today. </p> <p> The commitment by Russia, which has been in breach of the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe, followed two weeks of talks here aimed at settling problems over the pact that had arisen after the breakup of the Soviet  Union. </p> <p> Ukraine transferred the last of its nuclear warheads to Russia today, President Leonid Kuchma said in a statement. Under an agreement with the United  States and Russia signed in 1994, Ukraine was to receive $1 billion for giving up the weapons and Russia was to sell the nuclear components of the warheads to  the United States and compensate Ukraine, mostly in the form of fuel for its five nuclear power stations. Ukraine is the second former Soviet republic to disarm, after Kazakstan. </p> <p> Ukraine officially completed its nuclear disarmament today with a scattering  of sunflower seeds by the top defense officials of the United States, Russia and Ukraine. </p> <p> The ceremony at the Pervomaisk base, where more than 80 underground silos housed SS-19 missiles aimed at the United States, marked the end of a three-year process under which Ukraine gave up the nuclear arsenal it inherited from the Soviet Union. On Saturday the last of 1,900 strategic nuclear warheads were loaded on a train and sent to Russia for destruction. </p> <p> With his presidency at stake in elections on Sunday, Boris N. Yeltsin took a  dramatic and unabashedly political step to insure the support of Russia's top military chiefs. </p> <p> He promoted all five of them. </p> <p> The United States and Russia agreed today to press for international ratification of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty though they said it does not fully satisfy either of them. </p> <p> The agreement, announced by Secretary of State Warren Christopher and his Russian counterpart, Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, was an effort to break a negotiating stalemate as a deadline approaches for completion of the long-sought treaty. </p> <p> In an early test of President Boris N. Yeltsin's promise to root out corruption if re-elected, the retired general who heads Parliament's defense committee has accused some of Russia's highest-ranking generals of enriching themselves from the military budget. </p> <p> The charges, which have become the talk of Moscow, have rocked the military establishment. </p> <p> Time has stooped Vladimir Trotsenko's shoulders, but his memories are as clear as his cobalt blue eyes: the American flyer, his right arm in a new cast,  in a Soviet military hospital ward. The American, he recalled, would slowly repeat, "America -- San Francisco, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Chicago." </p> <p> Curious, Mr. Trotsenko, a paratrooper recovering from a knee injury, would hobble down the third-floor hospital corridor to gaze at the four imprisoned Americans. The airman with the broken arm would point to a crewman in a body cast and would make cradling motions with his arms, indicating that the man had  left two small children back home. </p> <p> Authorities found the bodies of 10 Russian prisoners of war today who military officials say were used as slave laborers, then tortured and executed by Chechen rebels. </p> <p> The bodies of four officers and six soldiers were found near Khatuni, in southeastern Chechnya, where Russian forces are attacking separatists seeking independence for Chechnya, Russian officials said. </p> <p> Negotiators from more than 30 countries agreed today on a pact to control the arms trade. </p> <p> The agreement covers conventional weapons and "dual-use technology," like computers that can be used to develop weapons. It is intended to keep arms from  reaching countries like Libya and Iran, where they could lead to destabilization. </p> <p> Directly challenging the authenticity of a major presidential directive, Aleksandr I. Lebed, the blunt, determined Russian national security adviser, said today that he did not believe that President Boris N. Yeltsin had actually written or signed a series of harsh new orders on the Chechen war that he received this week. </p> <p> The extraordinary statement, issued on a day when a spokesman said the President had left the Kremlin on a brief ''vacation inspection trip'' and rumors of failing health continued to circulate, reflected deep confusion about who is in control of the Government. </p> <p> The American Government-owned corporation that is charged with acquiring much of Russia's military stockpile of uranium for resale as civilian nuclear reactor fuel turned down repeated Russian offers this year to sell material sufficient to build 400 bombs comparable to the one that destroyed Hiroshima. </p> <p> The incident raises the question of whether the corporation, the United States Enrichment Corporation, put its own profits ahead of national security. </p> <p> In an unusually sharp attack on his own Government's policies, President Boris N. Yeltsin's security adviser, Aleksandr I. Lebed, has warned that Moscow's failure to pay soldiers' salaries could lead to serious unrest within the Russian military. </p> <p> A former general who revels in the image of blunt-spoken maverick, the latest criticism was especially stringent, even for Mr. Lebed. </p> <p> The United States launched a second missile strike against Iraq's southern air defenses tonight, just hours after President Clinton vowed that he would make President Saddam Hussein ''pay a price'' for sending his troops into the Kurdish enclave in northern Iraq. </p> <p> Three Navy ships and a submarine in the Persian Gulf launched 17 cruise missiles less than a day after the first American attack, in which  27 cruise missiles were fired against Iraqi military targets. </p> <p> The rest of the world, including most of America's NATO allies in Europe, made it clear today that the United States was on its own in taking military action against Iraq. </p> <p> Britain expressed strong support in words but kept the planes it has in the region out of the operation. Prime Minister John Major said the attack this morning was justified.  France did not take part either, and did not endorse the American decision to take military action, even after President Clinton called President Jacques Chirac before the missile attack in an appeal for support. </p> <p> The United States and Russia have reached agreement on the first part of an understanding that would allow the United States to proceed with efforts to build defenses against shorter-range missiles, while preserving the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972. </p> <p> The announcement was made yesterday by Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia. It was a confirmation of a tentative agreement reached in June, at the end of a meeting that covered contentious topics like Russian opposition to the expansion of NATO, Russian opposition to missile strikes on Iraq and Russian support for Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whom Washington wants to replace. </p> <p> Six years ago this fall, following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, a powerful coalition was painstakingly assembled here that ultimately gave the Bush Administration's war against Saddam Hussein not only the cover of the United Nations but also the backing of many of the world's major countries. </p> <p> This week, the United States has been almost isolated diplomatically as the Clinton Administration and a few friendly countries have tried to win support for even a condemnation of Iraq for its incursion into Kurdish territory. Washington's strikes on Iraq have been met with unease and even sharp criticism. </p> <p> Four months after publicly embracing him as a political heir, President Boris N. Yeltsin angrily appeared on national television tonight and dismissed Aleksandr I. Lebed, his frank and aggressive national security chief. </p> <p> Looking frail but determined in his first prolonged television appearance in weeks, Mr. Yeltsin said he could no longer tolerate the brazen and insubordinate behavior of the 46-year-old former army general. </p> <p> In a rare turn to foreign policy on the campaign trail, President Clinton today called for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to extend full membership to a first group of former Soviet bloc nations by the spring of 1999, the 50th anniversary of the Western military alliance. </p> <p> Mr. Clinton, saying that a ''gray zone of insecurity must not reemerge in Europe,'' urged Russia to view NATO's enlargement to former Warsaw Pact countries as an arrangement that will ''advance the security of everyone.'' And he told the American public that the expansion cannot be made ''on the cheap.'' </p> <p> Russia's Defense Minister said today that the military was in disarray and warned that the Kremlin may no longer be able to count on it in a crisis. </p> <p> Pressing for more funds, the official, Gen. Igor N. Rodionov, painted a bleak picture of an ever-shrinking military that was poorly trained, poorly housed and poorly fed. </p> <p> Without a clear explanation to the United States, Russia has backed away from signing an agreement on non-strategic missile defenses allowed under the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, senior Administration officials said today. </p> <p> In New York last month, Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia and Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced agreement on lower-velocity anti-missile systems, with negotiations to open on higher-velocity systems that the United States is developing. </p> <p> Seeking to ease tension between their nations, President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine met with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia outside Moscow today to discuss the fate of Russian bases and warships in the Black Sea. </p> <p> Russia and its former province have harbored fierce political and economic disputes ever since Ukraine won independence in 1991. These have been deepened by the countries' inability to settle on a way to divide up the former Soviet Black Sea fleet and to resolve the status of Sevastopol, the Russian fleet's base. Discussing the future of the city, which is located in the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, creates deeply emotional reactions on both sides. </p> <p> ''Loose Nukes'' begins with the warning that chaos and corruption in the new Russia are putting tons of nuclear material at risk and devotes much of the rest of the hour to reports of smuggling. The detective work of Sherry Jones, though inconclusive about the sources of the uranium and plutonium that have been spirited to Germany and Czechoslovakia, is loaded with suspicion that Russian scientists are in on it and Russian officials are covering up. </p> <p> The bothersome thing about uranium and plutonium is that a little goes such a long way. A Russian scientist with a taste for imagery compares highly enriched uranium to spaghetti: ''You may just put it in your pocket.'' I don't know anybody who carries spaghetti in a pocket, but one smuggler reportedly put a batch of uranium into his underwear on a train trip from Moscow to Minsk to Warsaw and finally to Prague, where he was caught. An American expert says that for countries with nuclear ambitions, like Iraq, Iran, North Korea and Pakistan, a pocketful could speed up its bomb-making from years to weeks or days. Imagine what an underwearful could do. </p> <p> It began with an early-morning knock at the door. Aleksandr Nikitin, a researcher for a Norwegian environmental organization and a former Russian naval officer, was still asleep. But the security police insisted that he quickly dress and come along. </p> <p> Mr. Nikitin had no opportunity to alert friends or colleagues. The telephone line at his St. Petersburg apartment had been turned off. </p> <p> In a vivid demonstration of the problems afflicting this country's once-proud space program, Russia has been without photo-reconnaissance satellites for nearly two months, Russian and Western scientists say. </p> <p> It is the first time since the early 1960's that the Russian military has been without the satellite pictures modern armies deem essential for detecting threats and conducting combat for more than a brief period. </p> <p> In spite of protests from its own arms control specialists, the Clinton Administration is on the verge of relaxing a two-decade-old Federal policy intended to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists and rogue states. </p> <p> The Energy Department will almost certainly recommend that plutonium from dismantled atomic bombs be used as fuel in civilian nuclear power plants before being discarded with radioactive waste. </p> <p> Aleksandr I. Lebed is the Russian general who became a politician and has no doubt that he will be Russia's next president. He says 25 years as a paratrooper taught him to talk concretely. In New York this week he used one word to describe Russia's efforts to prevent its nuclear warheads and materials from being stolen for terrorists or by rogue missile crews: ''unsatisfactory.'' </p> <p> But when it came to talking about what would then happen, he could not find concrete words in him. Nobody had ever lived in such a world, he said -- horrors unseen, dangers never conceived. When he said this to a few Russian and American journalists at the Regency Hotel I felt this man who looks like square rock and talks like rolling thunder was even more shaken than we were, because he knows more. </p> <p> A treaty banning chemical weapons worldwide is set to go into force next spring after the required number of ratifications was achieved this week with approval by Hungary. </p> <p> The treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention, prohibits the development, production, stockpiling or use of these arms and calls for the destruction of existing stocks and the factories that produced them. The treaty, opened for signing in 1993 and signed by 160 nations, was scheduled  to go into effect 180 days after the 65th ratification. </p> <p> The Director of Central Intelligence helped free a retired Russian spy today, convincing the Justice Department that his arrest was a mistake that could provoke Moscow to seize retired C.I.A. officers doing business in Russia. </p> <p> The retired K.G.B. colonel, Vladimir Galkin, was jailed on Oct. 29 after a deep misunderstanding between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the C.I.A. While on a business trip to the United States to buy police surveillance equipment, Mr. Galkin was met by F.B.I. agents at Kennedy International Airport and charged with espionage for trying to steal secrets about the ''Star Wars'' program. </p> <p> Several hundred Muslims stormed a village today to reclaim homes formerly occupied by Muslims in an area now held by Bosnian Serbs, setting off a firefight. </p> <p> Heavily armed American and Russian peacekeepers swooped in to quell the fighting, and some international officials here said the episode illustrated the danger of reducing the number of outside troops in Bosnia. </p> <p> In the cold war, spying was a game with unwritten rules. American and Soviet spies did not kill one another. An American arrested for espionage in Moscow was shipped home, not to the gulag. </p> <p> And since the cold war ended and the two spy services began gingerly collaborating on things like counterterrorism, bygones have mostly been bygones. Once someone hung up his cloak and sheathed his dagger, he was out of the game for good. </p> <p> More than a dozen employees at St. Petersburg's nuclear power plant took over the control room on Thursday and threatened to shut down the plant that provides most of the city's power unless they received months' worth of back pay.  This morning 400 of their colleagues joined the protest, and announced a hunger strike. Federal officials rushed to the scene to assess the hazard. </p> <p> By noon today, the Government had flown more than a billion rubles -- $200 for each worker -- to the plant and promised to deliver the rest within a week. </p> <p> Russia's Defense Minister told his NATO counterparts today that the alliance's plans for an expansion to include East European countries were ''unacceptable,'' but that it should be possible to negotiate a Russian-NATO security agreement anyway. </p> <p> ''We can only do this if there are no more unilateral decisions, like NATO's decision to expand,'' the Russian Minister, Igor N. Rodionov, said here today. He held four hours of talks at NATO headquarters. </p> <p> Confronting one of the most intractable problems of the post-cold-war era, the Energy Department said today that it would try to dispose of plutonium from old nuclear weapons both by using it as fuel in utilities' reactors and by mixing it with nuclear waste created when the plutonium was made and solidifying the mixture in glass. </p> <p> Officials said they were pursuing both options because they did not know which method could be put in operation sooner and for less cost, or even whether either was feasible. </p> <p> This week marks the fifth anniversary of the breakup of the Soviet Union, perhaps the most astonishing single event in the second half of the 20th century. The collapse combined at least three-and-a-half revolutions in one. Leninist politics were to be supplanted by democratic pluralism; Stalinist economics, by private ownership and the market; the czarist empire, by a dozen suddenly independent states, and what little was left of the cold war in 1991, by rapturous Russian-American partnership. </p> <p> Five years are hardly enough time for a final verdict on changes of this magnitude, but they are enough for provisional judgments about what's working and what isn't, and where re-thinking is needed. Some surprising conclusions suggest themselves. Those transformations that aroused the deepest doubts five years ago -- that led serious people to ask whether Russia was really ready for westernization -- have generally gone better than the doubters expected. </p> <p> NATO took the first formal step today to expand its alliance to include formerly Communist nations of Eastern Europe and then moved quickly to ease Russia's apprehensions by offering to negotiate a special charter with Russia and to increase military cooperation and contacts. </p> <p> The foreign ministers of NATO's 16 member nations, meeting at the alliance's headquarters near here, also sought to reassure Russia by pledging that the alliance had ''no intention, no plan and no reason'' to move nuclear weapons in the territory of any new members. </p> <p> LATE on the evening of May 28, 1993, something shattered the calm of the Australian outback and radiated shock waves outward across hundreds of miles of scrub and desert. Around the same time, truck drivers crossing the region and gold prospectors camping nearby saw the dark sky illuminated by bright flashes, and they and other people heard the distant rumble of loud explosions. </p> <p> The mysterious event might have been lost to history except for the interest of Government investigators in Australia and the United States who eventually came to wonder if the upheaval was the work of the Japanese doomsday cult accused of the poison-gas attack on Tokyo subways in 1995 that killed 12 people and hurt thousands. </p> <p> Last August, Cpl. Sergei Valdov drove his tank into the worst battle of the Chechen war. Most of his platoon died in that final, desperate fight for Grozny, the capital. Corporal Valdov was lucky: he escaped with only a large piece of shrapnel in his leg. </p> <p> When he heard three weeks ago that he and his devastated unit, Russia's 205th Motorized Infantry Brigade, were finally about to withdraw from Chechnya, he fell to his knees and wept. </p> <p> Responding to repeated American appeals, Russia promised today to remove a cache of nuclear material from Georgia by March. </p> <p> The supply of highly enriched uranium and spent nuclear fuel at a research reactor outside Tbilisi in the Caucasus has been a major worry for American officials, who fear that it could fall into the hands of aspiring nuclear powers or terrorists. </p> <p> Expressing unusual confidence that it has finally become possible to resolve the biggest diplomatic chasm separating Russia and the West, Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany predicted today that the standoff over NATO's expansion into Eastern Europe would end this year. </p> <p> ''I think that this year we will find a rational solution which will make NATO enlargement possible and will at the same time respect the security interests of all partners concerned,'' Mr. Kohl said at a news conference here after three hours of talks with President Boris N. Yeltsin. </p> <p> The United States has been making a quiet effort to have a cache of nuclear material moved out of this volatile region of the former Soviet Union, according to American and Georgian officials. </p> <p> But the operation to get the material out of Georgia, which is part of a broader program to stem the theft of nuclear bomb ingredients from Russia and its neighbors, has thus far been thwarted by months of diplomatic impasse between Russia and the United States. </p> <p> Just a few years after they ended their nuclear arms race, the United States and Russia are locked in a fierce competition for arms sales to Southeast Asia, with both countries offering potential purchasers some of the world's most sophisticated missiles as incentives. </p> <p> From Thailand to Malayasia, countries shopping for advanced fighter aircraft are demanding -- and receiving -- the chance to buy deadly accurate, air-to-air missiles that allow a jet pilot to shoot down an enemy plane he can not even see -- indeed, one that might be as far as 30 miles away. </p> <p> ''I grew up with the cold war,'' Francis Gary Powers Jr. says with pride. ''Whenever we had show and tell at school, I always brought my dad.'' </p> <p> Powers (at right) is standing in an exhibit hall at Central Intelligence Agency headquarters in Langley, Va. A portion of the space is devoted to his deceased father -- Francis Gary Powers Sr., the cold-war icon whose U-2 photo-reconnaissance plane was shot down on May 1, 1960, as he flew over Soviet airspace. Mounted, in part, to help kick off the C.I.A.'s 50th anniversary year, this exhibit comes with a catch: you aren't allowed to see it. ''We're not open to the public,'' says Midge Holmes, a friendly spokeswoman. ''That would create too many security problems.'' </p> <p> If you thought 1989 was an exciting year in Europe, with the Berlin wall crashing down and Communism being swept aside, then you won't want to miss 1997. Because the two major balancing institutions in Europe, NATO and the European Union, are both going to be ''adjusted'' in 1997, and it's going to make for a wild and crazy Eurocoaster. The Clinton Administration isn't worried. It's assuming that these two major balances in Europe can be simultaneously ''adjusted'' and create a new, even more stable equilibrium. </p> <p> Don't bet on it. </p> <p> Russia's cash-starved nuclear establishment is planning to sell two nuclear reactors to India, a move that has prompted  protests from Washington. </p> <p> The United States has urged Russia to drop the multibillion-dollar sale, asserting that it violates a 1992 agreement among nuclear suppliers and will hurt international efforts to stem the spread of nuclear weapons. </p> <p> Russia's Defense Ministers have rarely hesitated to tout their nation's military power. But Igor N. Rodionov has taken a decidedly different approach. </p> <p> In an increasingly desperate effort to prop up military spending, Mr. Rodionov has been bitterly belittling his nation's military forces. He has  even gone as far as to warn that Russia may lose control of its nuclear-tipped missiles, comments that deeply embarrassed the Yeltsin Government and drew stout denials from the Kremlin. </p> <p> In an effort to circumvent United States export controls, Russia's nuclear weapons establishment says it has obtained a powerful I.B.M. supercomputer through a European middleman. </p> <p> Russian nuclear officials, who disclosed the purchase, said they planned to use the computer to simulate nuclear tests. </p> <p> In a significant move aimed at placating Russian opposition to NATO's planned expansion eastward, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright will take to Moscow new proposals to reduce conventional weapons sharply in Central and Eastern Europe, senior American and alliance officials said today. </p> <p> In her first major speech overseas as Secretary of State, speaking to a meeting of NATO ministers in Brussels, Ms. Albright also proposed a joint NATO-Russian unit that could be used for peacekeeping. Though short on details, Ms. Albright cited the model of Bosnia and explained the proposal as another way to convince Moscow that cooperation with NATO can be peaceful and permanent. </p> <p> Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright today presented the Kremlin with a new arms control proposal that would freeze military forces near Russia's European periphery, the West's first detailed response to Russian anxieties about NATO expansion. </p> <p> The proposal, which was outlined by senior Western officials on condition that they not be identified, is part of a broader American arms control plan that seeks to persuade Moscow that the expansion of NATO would not bring the alliance's military might to Russia's doorstep. </p> <p> As Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright arrived here for a first round of talks with Russian leaders, American officials sought today to lower expectations about any quick Russian acquiescence to NATO expansion. </p> <p> Ms. Albright brings a package of proposals designed to convince Moscow that an expanded NATO would not be an aggressive alliance, and could lead to a Europe armed with fewer weapons than  the Russians face now. </p> <p> The United States has told the Kremlin that it is prepared to negotiate deeper cuts in long-range nuclear arms in an effort to ease Russian fears that the West seeks military advantage. </p> <p> The American proposal could lay the basis for an agreement on the goals of future arms talks at the summit meeting in Helsinki this month between President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin. </p> <p> President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin agreed today to differ over NATO expansion but formally determined that Russia would negotiate its own partnership agreement with the military alliance that would be signed before NATO began adding members in July. </p> <p> Ending their two-day summit meeting here with statements intended to demonstrate the strength of their cooperation, the two leaders also reported making several breakthroughs in arms control. </p> <p> The White House moved quickly today to answer senior Republicans' criticism of an agreement governing missile defenses that President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia signed in Helsinki, Finland. </p> <p> The agreement sets out distinctions between shorter-range missile defenses, which are built to protect troops and ships, and defenses against longer-range strategic missiles, which are all but banned under the 1972 Antiballistic Missile treaty, known as the ABM treaty. </p> <p> President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin began a two-day summit meeting here today, with the United States signaling its willingness to make further arms control concessions and a conciliatory Mr. Yeltsin stressing that the two leaders  must ''depart as friends as we've done in the past.'' </p> <p> In their first meeting in nearly a year, the two men dined together for more than two hours on salmon and reindeer, red and white wine and Champagne in the presidential palace along with their host, President Martti Ahtisaari. </p> <p> One of this city's proudest exhibits is not a religious icon or a portrait. It is the Kalashnikov assault rifle that a North Vietnamese soldier used to kill 78 Americans in the Vietnam War. </p> <p> ''We tried to select automatic weapons that were used in actual hot spots,'' said Nikolai D. Karpov, a senior official at the Museum of Armed Forces. </p> <p> Two simple facts define the geopolitical landscape today -- Russian weakness and Chinese strength. In the North Atlantic, across Eurasia, in East Asia, these two realities form the backdrop against which daily events occur, from the chaos in Albania to the cautiousness in Hong Kong. Yet increasingly the Clinton Administration's foreign policy looks as if it were intended to meet precisely the opposite challenges. </p> <p> As Russia continues its political bumbling, economic muddling and military retrenchment, the Administration is spending vast amounts of time, energy, money and political capital to deter it from launching an invasion of Central Europe. </p> <p> A retired K.G.B. colonel has for the first time disclosed his role as the human conduit between Moscow and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the two Americans who were executed for espionage in 1953 in one of the most notorious spy scandals of the cold war. </p> <p> Aleksandr Feklisov, 83, said in an interview today that the Rosenbergs were executed unjustly because while Julius Rosenberg did give away military secrets, he had not provided Russia with any useful material about the atomic bomb. </p> <p> While focused on NATO expansion and Russia's place in a new Europe, the summit meeting between Presidents Clinton and Boris N. Yeltsin in Helsinki last week also produced important progress on arms control. </p> <p> While nuclear weapons used to be the central issue between the Soviet Union and the United States, Moscow and Washington now want stability at lower, safer and cheaper levels of armament and expenditure. </p> <p> The summit meeting that begins here on Thursday caps a month of intensive bargaining and diplomatic courtship that American officials hope will lead to grudging Russian tolerance of a plan to expand the NATO alliance eastward. </p> <p> As advance parties awaited the arrival on Thursday of Presidents Clinton and Boris N. Yeltsin for two days of talks, Americans today described a campaign of military reassurances and economic inducements that they predict will allow Mr. Yeltsin to leave Helsinki declaring that he has fully defended Russian honor. $(President Clinton left Washington shortly after 9 P.M. Wednesday.$) </p> <p> Responding to American and Israeli appeals, Ukraine has decided against providing turbines for the nuclear reactor that Russia is selling to Iran. </p> <p> The decision is a victory for Western efforts to curtail nuclear cooperation with Iran. American officials said they hoped it would delay the Russian project but did not expect it to prevent the sale of the reactor. </p> <p> As President Clinton left for Paris today for a ceremony intended to clear the way for NATO expansion, Administration officials prepared for a long, hard struggle to win Senate support for the extension of formal security guarantees to former Soviet-bloc nations. </p> <p> While the signing on Tuesday of a new agreement between Russia and the 16 nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization smoothes over Russia's opposition to the enlargement of its cold-war military adversary, questions about the expansion of the alliance are growing at home. </p> <p> The Russian Government's top national security official said today that NATO's decision to expand had hurt the chances that Parliament would approve the latest strategic arms reduction treaty negotiated with the United States. </p> <p> The official, Ivan P. Rybkin, head of President Boris N. Yeltsin's Security Council, said in an interview that parliamentary ratification of the so-called Start 2 treaty was ''almost impossible.'' </p> <p> After years of frustrating diplomacy, Russia and Ukraine said tonight that they had ended their tug-of-war over the Black Sea Fleet. </p> <p> Under the accord, Russia will able to keep its portion of the former Soviet fleet for 20 years at the Ukrainian port of Sevastopol. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin dismissed the two top leaders of Russia's military today, lambasting them for resisting spending cuts and dragging their feet on restructuring of the armed forces. </p> <p> The abrupt ouster of Defense Minister Igor N. Rodionov and Gen. Viktor N. Samsonov, the Chief of the General Staff, reflects the growing power of reform-minded officials who insist the primary threats to Russia are economic, not military. </p> <p> Russia dropped a major demand today on limiting NATO's military forces, improving the prospects that the two sides will meet a May 27 target date for completing an agreement between the alliance and its former adversary. </p> <p> Russia's new position was outlined by Foreign Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov at an unscheduled meeting today with the visiting American Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright. </p> <p> Call it a case of bargain-hunter's remorse. </p> <p> Last year, Peru's generals scoured the discount market and found the perfect deal to turn the neighbors green with envy: not one, not two, but a dozen top-rated jet fighters for just $350 million. </p> <p> Facing a huge gap in revenue, Russia's reform-minded Government today urged Parliament to slash spending on the military and on state-subsidized industries. </p> <p> In a blunt speech to lawmakers, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin said the Government's attempts to raise more money by cracking down on tax evaders had failed, leaving the Government no choice but to cut its 1997 budget by about 20 percent. </p> <p> The United States, France and Russia have reached agreement to toughen sanctions against Iraq unless United Nations inspectors can certify that Baghdad is fully cooperating in efforts to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, officials meeting here said today. </p> <p> After the agreement was reached here, the United Nations Security Council, meeting in New York, adpoted a resolution late tonight threatening Iraq with the tougher measures. </p> <p> President Clinton told graduating West Point cadets today that the mere prospect of NATO's expansion into the former Soviet bloc had increased stability in Europe and decreased the chances that they ''will ever be called to fight in another war across the Atlantic.'' </p> <p> Mr. Clinton's commencement address at the United States Military Academy served as a coda to his trip this week to Europe, where he promised that the United States would remain engaged on the Continent. In Paris on Tuesday he and other NATO leaders signed a cooperation and security pact with Russia that opened a new chapter in the post-World War II history of Europe. </p> <p> The United States and Russia should reduce their nuclear arsenals to a few hundred weapons to lower the risk of war and keep other nations from producing huge stockpiles, the National Academy of Sciences said today. </p> <p> The academy said nuclear warheads should be seen as fundamentally useless except to deter an enemy's nuclear attack. </p> <p> During the cold war, the only thing Denverites expected to see coming from Moscow was a nuclear-tipped missile. </p> <p> But when Russia's Presidential jet touches down here on Thursday for an international summit meeting, it will bring Boris Yeltsin, and he will find an American heartland city reshaped, in an odd way, by Boris Yeltsin. </p> <p> As Krzysztof Bertram rushes through the hectic pace of his daily life, balancing studies in business with work at an insurance company, he has little doubt where his country should be headed. </p> <p> ''For sure Poland has to join NATO,'' said the crisply dressed Mr. Bertram, 27, as he checked out courses at the Warsaw Polytechnic that might further his career. ''The balance of power has changed. The Soviet Union is not around anymore, and I think NATO will be the organization to provide security for the world.'' </p> <p> The United States, Russia and 28 other nations agreed today on the framework for a treaty to reduce the number of tanks and other non-nuclear weapons in Europe, especially in Central European countries of the former Warsaw Pact. </p> <p> The agreement would replace -- and go further than -- a 1990 accord on conventional arms between NATO and nations that were then members of the Soviet bloc. </p> <p> One bright day last week, Col. Aleksandr Tere khov walked out of his office in the Moscow Military District headquarters to the nearest subway station. There, he sat down in front of the marble entrance and doused himself in alcohol. Then he dropped a match on his lap. </p> <p> Colonel Terekhov, the chief financial officer at the prestigious Moscow base, died two days later. Friends released a statement saying his suicide had been prompted ''by the grave financial position of Officer Terekhov's family.'' </p> <p> Now that the Madrid NATO summit meeting is over, and Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have been invited to join the alliance, the Clinton team is again peddling the notion that it's all O.K.: NATO can be expanded, Russia won't care, the costs will be minimal and anyone who opposes it is a Yalta-loving, umbrella-carrying, Munich-leaning isolationist. </p> <p> Hogwash. NATO expansion is quietly eating away at what really matters: the U.S.-Russia strategic relationship. When you ask Clinton officials how NATO expansion will affect Russian implementation of the most far-reaching nuclear arms reduction treaty ever signed -- Start 2 -- they mumble that Boris tells them it will all be O.K., but they can't say for sure. They can say for sure that Poland has to be in NATO, because there are votes in that, but they can't say for sure how this will affect nuclear missiles pointed at us. What a way to run a railroad. </p> <p> As international arms sales grew last year for the first time in several years, the United States pulled further ahead as the world's biggest weapons merchant, according to an authoritative Government report on the issue. </p> <p> The annual arms survey by the Congressional Research Service showed that the American share of the weapons market was up by nearly 23 percent last year, to $11.3 billion in orders. Sales of American arms increased at a far more dramatic pace than the global market, which grew to $31.8 billion last year, up about 5 percent. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration said today that Russia might have detonated a nuclear weapon on a remote Arctic island less than two weeks ago, in spite of its support for an international moratorium on nuclear tests. The Administration said it was investigating the matter and seeking an explanation from Moscow. </p> <p> Administration officials said ''a seismic event'' took place on Aug. 16 near Novaya Zemlya, an island where Russia maintains a nuclear testing site. The officials said that while it was not yet clear that the seismic activity was the result of a nuclear explosion, the activity could not readily be explained as a natural phenomenon, like an earthquake. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration has been quietly pressing Russia for most of this year to stop Russian scientists and military institutes from helping Iran develop a new ballistic missile that could reach Israel, Saudi Arabia and  American troops in the Persian Gulf, senior Administration officials say. </p> <p> The Russian scientists' assistance has continued, officials said, even though President Clinton raised the matter with President Boris N. Yeltsin in private meetings in June at the Denver economic summit. </p> <p> The United States signed a package of arms control agreements today with Russia that pushed back by five years one of the major treaties of the cold war, but that could clear the way for further cuts in nuclear weapons. </p> <p> The agreement would give Russia  until the end of 2007 to dismantle launching systems -- missile silos, bombers and submarines -- as required by the second strategic arms reduction treaty, or Start 2. However, the systems must still be disabled by 2003. </p> <p> In the 80's, Israel's Mossad warned of nuclear weaponry being developed secretly by Saddam Hussein. The C.I.A. disagreed; ''not for 10 years'' was its complacent judgment, which warped Bush Administration policy. Now everyone admits that Mossad had it right. </p> <p> One year ago, Israel shared with our Defense Intelligence Agency Mossad's evidence and conclusions about a new proliferation threat from a supporter of terrorism. </p> <p> Civilian scientists are strongly criticizing the Federal Government for saying that a seismic event that rocked the Russian wilds two months ago might have been an underground nuclear blast. </p> <p> The scientists say the tremor was unquestionably natural in origin, and they suggest that bureaucratic foes of the nuclear test ban treaty are distorting the truth in a bid to torpedo the treaty's ratification in the Senate. </p> <p> George Soros, the Hungarian-born American financier and philanthropist, said yesterday that he would donate as much as $500 million in the next three years in Russia trying to improve health care, expand educational opportunities and help retrain the military for civilian jobs. </p> <p> In a telephone interview from Moscow, Mr. Soros said he would announce the initiative in eight fields  today. This latest gift would make him the leading philanthropist in Russia, as well as a donor whose presence exceeds that of the United States, which gave Russia $95 million in foreign aid last year. </p> <p> What is coming to be known as the Iran missile crisis is in many ways the quintessential post-cold-war foreign-policy problem. But before we go to war with Iran to solve it, let's sort out fact from hype. </p> <p> Here is what U.S. intelligence says: Since the early 1990's, Iran (like Syria, Iraq, Egypt and Israel) has developed the capability to build and launch short-range (185 to 375 miles) liquid-fuel Scud-class missiles. At the same time Iran has been trying to develop its own version of the North Korean ''No Dong'' Scud missile, which has a longer range (800 to 925 miles) but is highly inaccurate. In 1993 North Korea provided Iran blueprints, and possibly even a single copy, of the No Dong missile, but then North Korean aid to Iran tailed off. </p> <p> French President Jacques Chirac met with Boris Yeltsin in Moscow to cook up an Iranian natural-gas deal that would (1) enrich their business interests, (2) gain a diplomatic foothold in the Persian Gulf by helping terrorists obtain missiles and (3) distract their restive unemployed by sticking a thumb in the U.S. eye. </p> <p> When Vice President Al Gore tried to brief his counterpart, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, on solid U.S. intelligence that Russian scientists were secretly helping the terrorist state of Iran build a 1,200-mile missile that would hold hostage the populations of Tel Aviv, Ankara and Riyadh, the American was tartly rebuffed. </p> <p> The director general of a new organization monitoring the destruction of chemical weapons said today that unless Russia ratified the treaty banning their use within two weeks, Moscow will be cut out of critical decisions on the inspection system, weakening the accord significantly. Russia has the largest stockpile of chemical arms. </p> <p> The official, Jose Mauricio Bustani, head of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, said in an interview that for nations to attend an international conference beginning Dec. 1 to establish operating methods, they must have ratified the accord by Oct. 31. Nations must also turn over detailed information on chemical arms they possess or could produce. </p> <p> In signs that both Iraq and the United States would like to step back from another conflict in the Persian Gulf, Iraq sent signals today that it did not want a military confrontation, and the United States persuaded Russia, once Iraq's strongest ally, to press Saddam Hussein to back down in the dispute over weapons inspections. </p> <p> In Baghdad, the official Iraqi News Agency reported that at a Cabinet meeting President Hussein ''stressed that Iraq was not seeking a confrontation with the American administration.'' </p> <p> Although Iraq has agreed to allow United Nations arms inspectors back to Baghdad, officials and diplomats here fear they will return as a weakened force, facing the same intransigence as in the past but possibly with less ability to uncover weapons of mass destruction that Saddam Hussein has had three weeks to hide. </p> <p> Officials fear that their work could be compromised by any promises Russia may have made to Iraq that it would press for an early end to inspections, emboldening the Iraqis to become even more defiant and devious than before. And they are concerned that during the period since Oct. 29, when on-site inspections ended, the Iraqis may have hidden more evidence, destroyed monitoring equipment and perhaps assembled weapons or produced toxic substances and stored them away. </p> <p> As Bill Clinton continues to pretend that no concession has been made to Iraq, Saddam Hussein has arranged with Russia's Yevgeny Primakov to remove the element of surprise from the U.N. Special Commission's searches for long-concealed germ-warfare facilities. </p> <p> The key is in Primakov's statement, swallowed whole by Clinton officials, that he negotiated an agreement to make inspections ''more effective.'' In Orwellese, that means penetrating the U.N. team with Russian spies. </p> <p> See the spectacle of Moscow selling its latest missile know-how to Iran's ayatollahs and championing the sordid cause of Iraq's Saddam, proudly bestriding the world stage by sticking Russia's thumb in America's eye. </p> <p> And then read this headline on the front page of The Times: ''Russia Is Seeking More Western Aid for Financial Ills; American Backing Asked.'' </p> <p> It is not yet clear how the Iraq crisis will end. But it's already clear what it has exposed -- the serious tensions just beneath the surface of the U.S.-Russia relationship. Last Friday night, I found myself in Moscow watching CNN report from the White House that some U.S. officials suspect that the Russians and Iraqis may have cooked up the whole Iraq crisis in order to help Baghdad escape from U.N. sanctions. Wow. That's a serious charge. We haven't heard that kind of conspiracy talk since Khrushchev was pounding his shoe at the U.N. But after meeting here with Russian officials and analysts I can report that such charges certainly reflect the prevailing mood of U.S.-Russian ties. The U.S.-Russia relationship has gone in the last seven years from a strategic partnership, to a pragmatic partnership, to a relationship of benign neglect, to a relationship heading for malign neglect. Is it time to break out the reruns of ''Seven Days in May'' and ''From Russia With Love''? </p> <p> Not yet, but several factors are combining to push Russo-American relations downhill. One is a global phenomenon: There is a growing backlash against America's overwhelming economic and military superiority. America's allies and enemies are increasingly united in resentment of the U.S. Do you know what Iran calls America today? Not ''the Great Satan.'' Iran calls America ''the Capital of Global Arrogance.'' Unfortunately, that's also what the French, the Malaysians, the Russians, the Chinese, the Japanese and the Germans call Washington behind its back. </p> <p> Russia has detained and ordered the expulsion of an Iranian it accuses of trying to buy missile technology, the Russian Foreign Ministry said today. </p> <p> Iran's Ambassador to Moscow insisted that the 33-year-old Iranian was a student who had arrived in Russia with an ordinary visa. </p> <p> The three Presidents of the Central European countries that have been invited to join NATO are unlikely to make an appearance in the Senate committee rooms in Washington where the debate over expanding the alliance will heat up early next year. </p> <p> But in an ''if you were there'' exercise, Transitions magazine, a Prague-based monthly, asked the three leaders to imagine just such an encounter. </p> <p> President Clinton has issued new guidelines for the use of nuclear weapons, ordering the Pentagon to focus less on planning a prolonged nuclear fight with a superpower like Russia and more on focused attacks to deter smaller powers from using chemical or biological weapons, Administration officials said tonight. </p> <p> The new guidelines recognize the world's fundamental shift in power -- and the rapidly changing threats -- since the collapse of the Soviet Union. The guidelines replace those that were put in place in 1981 under President Reagan at the height of the cold war. </p> <p> The fourth and last wife of the British master spy Kim Philby has written her memoirs of life with the most famous mole in the history of espionage. </p> <p> And his life in Russia, at least initially, was grim. Philby's loneliness, depression and heavy drinking after his defection are well documented. His Russian widow, Rufina Philby, has added one startling new detail. According to her book, ''I Went My Own Way,'' which was released today, Philby attempted suicide in the 1960's. </p> <p> The Russian Foreign Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, told the United States and other NATO members here today that Russia remained opposed to the use of force to get Iraq to permit full international inspection of suspected storage sites for biological and chemical weapons stockpiles. </p> <p> On another matter, Mr. Primakov assured the allies that Russia would continue to contribute to the NATO peacekeeping force in Bosnia if the mission is extended beyond next June. </p> <p> The United States today opened up a nuclear processing plant in Ohio to international weapons experts, complete with continuous videotaping and surprise inspections, in hope of inducing Russia to do the same. </p> <p> Four inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency arrived at the United States Enrichment Corporation, a recently privatized plant in Portsmouth, Ohio, to install tamper-evident seals and monitoring equipment. They are watching the dilution of uranium that had been enriched for military use, so it is unsuitable for bombs or submarine reactors, but can be turned into fuel for civilian power plants. </p> <p> The United States Government has received concrete promises of action by the Russian Government to stop Russian companies and scientists from assisting Iran's ballistic missile program, senior American officials say. </p> <p> The issue of Russian scientific and technological help to Iran as it attempts to build a ballistic missile capable of hitting Israel, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Russia itself is the single most contentious issue between Moscow and Washington, officials say. </p> <p> Angered by what he considers needless intensification of tension between Iraq and the United States, President Boris N. Yeltsin today dispatched a special envoy to Baghdad with orders to end the mounting crisis over weapons inspections. </p> <p> It will not be an easy task, but officials in the Kremlin today said they were increasingly worried that President Clinton -- enmeshed in a deepening scandal at home -- will attempt to assert his leadership abroad with a rapid military strike on Iraq. </p> <p> Russia and the United States displayed their sharp disagreements over Iraq today, with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright expressing deep skepticism that diplomatic solutions were possible and the Russian Foreign Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, saying that the negotiating process had just begun. </p> <p> Combined with a call by China at the United Nations today for a peaceful solution to the Iraq problem, Russia's stand was a setback to Ms. Albright's efforts. On her tour of Europe and the Middle East, she has been trying to create a sense of urgency and to convince the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, to capitulate quickly to United Nations demands for unconditional weapons inspections or face an intensive American and British bombing campaign. </p> <p> Two decades of experience have taught the citizens of Baghdad a simple military lesson: when bombs are aimed at military targets in this city, civilians die. </p> <p> Although the Clinton Administration has so far talked only in general terms about military action against Iraq, the assumption here is that attacks will come by air and will be aimed at the elite Republican Guard that protects President Saddam Hussein and perhaps at the separate and pervasive security and intelligence services. </p> <p> President Clinton sought to intensify pressure on Iraq today, dispatching senior officials to consult with American allies in Europe and the Middle East and warning President Saddam Hussein, in the State of the Union address, that his defiance of the United Nations cannot continue. </p> <p> In his speech tonight to a joint session of Congress, Mr. Clinton cautioned the Iraqi President: ''You cannot defy the will of the world.'' Mr. Hussein has used weapons of mass destruction before, Mr. Clinton noted, and said, ''We are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.'' </p> <p> Who should get credit for the fact that the Federal budget is now virtually balanced? </p> <p> Economists and budget experts trying to answer that question have offered some predictable and some unusual suggestions as they celebrate the possible demise of the deficit. </p> <p> The Iraqis and the chief United Nations weapons inspector made some progress in talks today, but Iraq is clinging to what the inspections chief, Richard Butler, called ''disarmament by declaration,'' refusing to provide further documentation to back its assertions that certain weapons have been eliminated. </p> <p> In an interview before his final session of talks tonight, Mr. Butler described the sessions as the toughest he has experienced since he took charge of disarming Iraq last year. </p> <p> The Russian countryside can be stunning in its beauty. Deep groves of birch trees run for miles outside Moscow, interrupted only by icy tributaries of the thundering Volga and tiny villages, their church domes glistening in the harsh winter light. </p> <p> Take the wrong road, though, and you're in a factory town. The signs are easy to notice: the trees thin and the sky turns gray on the clearest afternoon. If there is water, people avoid it. Animals disappear; birds seem sullen, drunk. The elderly women who line nearly every country road -- selling identical buckets of beets, carrots or potatoes -- are gone. </p> <p> Nobody would be foolish enough to stand beside the road to Dzerzhinsk. It's too scary. There is plenty of debate about which place on this poisoned earth is the most tainted. There's no way to prove it, but Dzerzhinsk, a repository of the worst excesses of our harsh and heedless century, may have earned the ghastly prize. </p> <p> Only 250 miles east of Moscow, Dzerzhinsk has for decades churned out tons of deadly gases: DDT, blister gas, mustard gas, rocket fuel. Factories here now produce less fearsome chemicals, but they once made a Russian version of Agent Orange as well as mercury, chlorine and lead. When the chemical weapons manufactured here were no longer needed, they were simply buried in rusting barrels that have swollen and burst with age. That helped form a festering reservoir of toxic waste known as the White Sea, which like the city itself was a secret until 1991. Biologists who have taken samples say it may contain the planet's highest concentration of dioxin, which can cause cancer even in minute doses. </p> <p> If somebody offers you food in Dzerzhinsk -- a city of 300,000 residents -- he will almost certainly announce that the food is not grown locally. How else could you bring yourself to eat it? The Russian Government says little publicly about the current condition of the town, dominated by the hulking furnaces of the Kaprolaktam chemical factory, but it has made one standing offer: there is a free gas mask available for any resident who wants one. </p> <p> Most people don't bother. Many on the outskirts of the city heat their homes with dioxin-soaked coal they dig from the ground. Even in a country so deeply scarred by pollution and illness that mortality rates rival those of Africa, the vital statistics for Dzerzhinsk are hard to believe: life expectancy is just 42 years for men, 47 for women. Serfs breaking rocks in the Czar's Russia lived longer than that. </p> <p> ''You cannot believe that any country could do this to itself,'' says Lev Fyodorev, a chemical weapons expert. ''But nobody wants to admit there is a problem. In Russia, we still act like it's better to pretend that nothing is wrong.'' </p> <p> In remarks that seemed to astonish everyone but the man who delivered them, President Boris N. Yeltsin warned today that the United States activities in Iraq could lead to a world war. </p> <p> ''One must be careful in a world that is saturated with all kinds of weapons,'' Mr. Yeltsin said in televised remarks during a meeting in the Kremlin. ''By his actions Clinton might get into a world war. They are acting too loudly. Too loudly.'' </p> <p> The most troubling statement in Boris Yeltsin's career was made this week to his chief of staff, Anatoly Chubais. The Russian President was provoked by a White House comment that the U.S. response to any use by Saddam Hussein of weapons of mass destruction would be ''devastating.'' </p> <p> Yeltsin took this to mean that the use of germ warfare by Saddam against the U.S. or its allies could well be met by nuclear war from the Americans. It is in our interest that such an assumption be made, thereby deterring any dictator anywhere from launching bacteriological war. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration's assertion that it has the right to attack Iraq to force Saddam Hussein to open sites to weapons inspectors is based on a succession of Security Council resolutions and statements and on the United Nations Charter itself. </p> <p> But officials have been reluctant to discuss specifics. ''Depending upon the factual situation, there could be various legal justifications under international law for military action against Iraq,'' James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said last week. </p> <p> President Clinton said today that Iraq had agreed to allow United Nations weapons inspectors immediate and unconditional access throughout the country, and he began to seek British, French and Russian support for a Security Council resolution that would warn Saddam Hussein of serious consequences if the deal is violated. </p> <p> In a news conference today, Mr. Clinton indicated that the agreement, reached by Secretary General Kofi Annan and President Hussein, would restore free and unfettered inspections by the United Nations Special Commission, known by its acronym, Unscom. </p> <p> Secretary General Kofi Annan announced tonight that he is traveling to Iraq to try to resolve the crisis that has developed over President Saddam Hussein's refusal to open his country to unconditional inspection for proscribed weapons of mass destruction. </p> <p> Mr. Annan said he will leave on Thursday and hold discussions with Iraqi officials this weekend. An advance team from his office was dispatched tonight. </p> <p> United Nations weapons inspectors have found evidence that Russia held discussions with Iraq about selling Baghdad equipment that could be used to develop biological weapons, an official familiar with Iraqi weapons programs said today. </p> <p> But the official cautioned that it was not clear that any equipment had actually been delivered. </p> <p> A defector from the former Soviet biological weapons program said in an interview today that Moscow's cold war plans for World War III included preparing ''hundreds of tons'' of anthrax bacteria and scores of tons of smallpox and plague viruses. </p> <p> The defector, Dr. Kanatjan Alibekov, now known as Ken Alibek, was second-in-command of a branch of the Soviet program and defected in 1992. He said today that the bacteria and viruses could have been mounted on intercontinental ballistic missile warheads on several days' notice in the early 1980's. Dr. Alibek, a 47-year-old native of Kazakhstan, said the Russian military was still running a biological weapons program in 1991, a year after Mikhail S. Gorbachev ordered it halted. </p> <p> A chilling discovery about the possible nature of a Soviet biological warfare agent has fueled a debate among Government scientists as to whether the current anthrax vaccine will adequately protect American troops. </p> <p> The discovery is that the anthrax spores released in a 1979 accident at a Soviet military site in Sverdlovsk probably contained a blend of at least four different strains of anthrax bacilli, as if it had been devised to overwhelm a vaccine. Sverdlovsk -- now Yekaterinburg -- lies in the Urals 900 miles east of Moscow. </p> <p> The Kremlin, trying yet again to assert itself in one of the last places where its diplomatic power remains undiminished, announced with great fanfare tonight that it had cobbled together a deal to stave off an American air strike against Iraq. </p> <p> No sooner had the Kremlin spoken than the Iraqi Government, in a statement read to reporters in Baghdad, denied that any such agreement had been reached between President Saddam Hussein and the Russian envoy, Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Posvalyuk. </p> <p> With France, Russia and the Arab League engaging in intense consultations to find a compromise that would avert an American military strike on Iraq, Secretary General Kofi Annan today canceled a long-planned trip to the Middle East in order to remain at United Nations headquarters and help work toward a peaceful solution of the Iraq crisis. </p> <p> Russia, France and the Arab League, which oppose using military force, are struggling to find a formula acceptable to Iraq as well as to the Security Council, diplomats report. The Russians said Iraq had shifted from its blanket refusal to give United Nations weapons inspectors unrestricted access to eight sites suspected of concealing materials used to make biological and chemical weapons, and has offered proposals that fall short of full disclosure. </p> <p> Standing side by side, President Clinton and the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, issued a stern new warning today to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq that he will face substantial military action unless he complies with United Nations weapons inspectors and Security Council resolutions. </p> <p> ''If Saddam does not comply with the unanimous will of the international community, we must be prepared to act, and we are,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''Whether there is a diplomatic solution or not is entirely up to Saddam Hussein.'' </p> <p> The United States and Britain may be on solid enough legal ground to justify a massive bombing raid of Iraq if United Nations weapons inspectors are denied access to its installations. </p> <p> Even if the two countries do not receive new authority from the Security Council, existing resolutions appear to give ample cover and have already been invoked in other military actions against Iraq since the Persian Gulf war. </p> <p> Russian officials announced tonight that they had arrested a retired military intelligence official in connection with the killing of an investigative journalist three years ago. </p> <p> The journalist, Dmitri Kholodov, 27, had been investigating corruption in the Russian military when he was killed by opening a booby-trapped suitcase. </p> <p> Russia's Defense Minister, Igor Sergeyev, sharply criticized the United States today for threatening to attack Iraq, warning Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen that a strike could undercut efforts to improve military ties between Moscow and Washington. </p> <p> Speaking bluntly at the beginning of a meeting on arms control and other security issues, Mr. Sergeyev said Russia felt ''deep concern'' about the prospect of an American-led attack and accused the Clinton Administration of movingly hastily toward confrontation. </p> <p> Biological warfare experts are concerned that countries like Iraq may be able to create forms of anthrax that can overcome the vaccine now being given to American troops in the Persian Gulf. </p> <p> The concern stems from recent evidence that the Soviet Union may have mixed together several strains of anthrax, presumably to enhance the lethality of its germ weapons. Further questions have been raised by separate reports that Russian scientists have produced strains of anthrax genetically engineered to produce new toxins. </p> <p> In a rebuff to the United States, Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry said today that it plans to sell several more nuclear reactors to Iran. </p> <p> The disclosure came as the United States signed an agreement in Kiev under which Ukraine would withdraw from the Russian program to build a reactor at Bushire, Iran. </p> <p> In an effort to expand its influence on the special commission charged with disarming Iraq, Russia has asked Secretary General Kofi Annan to name a Russian as co-deputy chairman of the panel, United Nations officials said today. </p> <p> The move is believed to require Security Council approval because the resolution setting up the commission specifically mentioned a chairman and a deputy and made no mention of other officers or of the nationalities of the officers. </p> <p> In a move that could threaten the delicate peace in the Balkans, Russia has agreed in principle to sell Yugoslavia tanks, attack helicopters, ground-to-air missiles, MIG-29's and spare parts, American officials report. </p> <p> The deal, which was arranged in Moscow in December, has not been made public, and American officials say they are in the dark about the details, including the quantity of weapons and how many have already been delivered. </p> <p> The United States is offering Russia an opportunity to expand its lucrative business launching foreign satellites if it clamps down on the sale of missile technology to Iran, senior American officials say. </p> <p> The American position has been conveyed confidentially to the Russians and is part of a broad effort to discourage Russian companies and institutes from helping Iran develop a new surface-to-surface missile. </p> <p> Russia's powerful Atomic Energy Minister was abruptly relieved of his duties today in a move that startled Russian and Western experts. </p> <p> A pugnacious official who spent much of his career developing Soviet nuclear weapons, Viktor N. Mikhailov has been one of the most influential figures in Russia's military and civilian nuclear establishment. </p> <p> The Security Council tonight unanimously endorsed Secretary General Kofi Annan's agreement with Iraq on weapons inspections, but without authorizing an automatic military response if Baghdad fails to comply. </p> <p> A majority of Security Council members -- led by China, France and Russia -- rebuffed the United States by holding out against any explicit threat, particularly wording that would appear to give a green light to an American attack in the event Iraq violates the agreement. </p> <p> Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia said today that his Government would push to ratify the second strategic arms reduction treaty in order to prepare the way for President Clinton to visit Moscow for a summit meeting by the middle of the year. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration has quietly made a summit meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin conditional on Russian passage of Start II, senior Administration officials say. Start II would cut each side's existing levels of warheads by two-thirds. </p> <p> The B-61-11, the latest addition to America's nuclear arsenal, is known as an earth penetrator. The new nose and steel casings add weight and strength, and the fuse has been changed to delay detonation until seconds after impact. The result is a bomb that burrows several feet before exploding, enabling it to obliterate targets like command bunkers and chemical-weapons factories several hundred feet beneath the surface. All in all, it represents a significant leap in bomb design, and that's precisely the problem. Pentagon officials deny that the B-61-11 is a new weapon. </p> <p> This is because the ''physics package'' -- the primary fission reaction and the secondary fusion reaction that power the explosion -- is the same as in the B-61-7 (which offers ''dial a yield,'' literally a dial on the casing that adjusts the payload from 10 kilotons up to 340 kilotons, a kiloton being equal to 1,000 tons of TNT). But if you define a weapon by its military application, this one is new; the Pentagon did not previously have an earth penetrator. </p> <p> Except for peeling paint, little has changed at the Frunze Naval Academy since it was founded by Peter the Great in 1715. </p> <p> Despite hard times, the naval academy, an elegant ocher-colored palace on the banks of the Neva, remains one of Russia's most prestigious military institutions. There are still six applicants for every position, and traditions are jealously guarded. </p> <p> Even before he was appointed Russia's Minister for Atomic Energy today, Yevgeny Adamov had caught Washington's attention. </p> <p> Mr. Adamov, 58, a nuclear engineer, went to Teheran last month with Viktor N. Mikhailov, the minister who was ousted Monday, to meet with Iranian officials. </p> <p> A truck laden with 22 tons of stainless steel that could be used to make missiles has been intercepted on its way to Teheran, raising new questions about Russia's determination to end assistance to Iran's missile program. </p> <p> American officials warned the Russian authorities several days in advance that a shipment of steel, which they said was a special alloy particularly suited for use in making fuel tanks for Scud missiles, was expected to leave Moscow, based on United States intelligence reports. </p> <p> The United States and Britain have begun a secretive operation to remove nuclear material from the volatile Caucasus nation of Georgia, Western officials say. </p> <p> The supply of highly enriched uranium and spent nuclear fuel is stored at a research reactor outside the Georgian capital of Tbilisi. It has been a serious concern for American officials, who feared it could fall into the hands of Chechen gangs, Iran or another aspiring nuclear power. </p> <p> Ben & Jerry's is against expanding NATO.  So is Phyllis Schlafly, the arch-conservative activist. So is Sam Nunn, the retired Georgia Democrat who was the Senate's most authoritative voice on national security matters. </p> <p> From left, right and center -- and all points in between on the political compass -- an unlikely coalition of arms-control advocates, business leaders, United Nations-bashers and foreign-policy experts have launched a grass-roots campaign to derail the addition of Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic to the military alliance. </p> <p> Russia's deteriorating control of its nuclear weapons is increasing the danger of an accidental or unauthorized attack on the United States, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning group warned today. </p> <p> A dozen missiles fired from a Russian nuclear submarine would kill nearly seven million Americans instantly, and millions more would die from radiation, according to a study conducted under the auspices of Physicians for Social Responsibility, which won the Nobel Peace Prize for its work on nuclear weapons in 1985. The study is to be published tomorrow in The New England Journal of Medicine. </p> <p> Russia plans to deliver advanced antiaircraft missiles to the Greek Cypriot Government in August, despite American protests that the sale will inflame tensions on the island, part of which is Turkish-controlled. </p> <p> The United States has repeatedly sought to block the sale of the S-300 system, as the missiles are known, and Turkey has even warned that it may take military action. But today the head of the Russian arms sales company Rosvooruzheniye, Yevgeny Ananyev, said Russia was determined to ship the weapons. </p> <p> Pakistan's test of a new missile with a range exceeding 900 miles, a weapon able to strike Bombay or New Delhi with a nuclear warhead, was based on technology smuggled from North Korea, United States Government officials and private analysts said today. </p> <p> The new liquid-fueled missile, called the Ghauri, is an enhanced version of the North Korean Rodong missile, which is itself a fancy version of the Scud missile developed in Moscow in the 1960's, they said. </p> <p> Russia is helping India to build a sea-launched ballistic missile that can carry a nuclear warhead and strike deep into Pakistan, say senior Clinton Administration officials, who fear the program will inflame simmering tensions in South Asia. </p> <p> The assistance has continued for at least three years, the officials said, despite assurances from Russia that its scientists are not contributing restricted technology to India's missile programs. </p> <p> A black American marine has been severely beaten by a band of Russian skinheads in a new wave of assaults against foreigners of African and Asian descent. </p> <p> The attack occurred in daylight on Saturday at Fili Park, a busy area where Russians often buy compact disks, according to Western officials. </p> <p> The leaders of the seven largest industrial democracies and Russia called on Indonesia's leader today to show restraint in responding to the country's growing unrest, and said a solution would have to involve political as well as economic changes. </p> <p> President Clinton said President Suharto should ''open a dialogue with all elements of the society'' in an attempt to create ''a genuine sense of political reform and reconciliation'' while continuing to overhaul Indonesia's economy. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration offered no objections in the Security Council today when a travel ban on Iraqi officials was ended, but the United States and Russia are still at an impasse over when and how to respond to a report last month that in effect declared Iraq free of nuclear weapons. </p> <p> The travel ban had never actually been imposed, and American officials said the step was not significant. But the Administration fought hard and long last fall to win Security Council backing for the measure, which would have restricted international travel for top Iraqis responsible for a lack of cooperation with the arms inspectors of the United Nations Special Commission. </p> <p> The United States and Russia have reached a broad agreement on how to proceed with future nuclear-arms inspections of Iraq now that the International Atomic Energy Agency has declared itself ready to move out of an active disarmament phase and into long-term monitoring. </p> <p> A formal statement by the Security Council is expected this week, though diplomats are hard pressed to explain why it is being further delayed, since Council members are finally in accord and are preparing to ask the nuclear agency to present its plans for a change in monitoring. </p> <p> This just in from the Pentagon: Cuba is not, after all, much of a threat to national security. </p> <p> The Pentagon's intelligence report, like all matters Cuban, ignited controversy on Capitol Hill. Even before its release, Speaker Newt Gingrich protested to the Pentagon that Fidel Castro remained ''a dangerous and unstable tyrant.'' </p> <p> The United States and its allies remain reluctant to use force against the Yugoslav Army, despite NATO's decision on Thursday to put on a display of air power in countries bordering the Serbian province of Kosovo, officials of the United States and other NATO member-nations said today. </p> <p> But Western policy, as it is being formulated on the run, hinges on the credible threat of force in order to prompt a negotiated solution between the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, and the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo, who make up 90 percent of the Serb province. </p> <p> Time and Again  Spanning the early 1890's to the mid-1940's, 80 interiors, still lifes, landscapes and figure paintings by Pierre Bonnard are going on display at the Museum of Modern Art from Sunday through Oct. 13. The show is intended to illuminate Bonnard not simply as a painter of hedonistic beauty but also as a master of structure and composition whose works convey complex emotions. Information: (212) 708-9400. </p> <p> The United States, Russia, China, Britain and France called on India and Pakistan today to freeze their nuclear weapons development and agree not to test nuclear missiles or arm them with warheads. </p> <p> In return, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, all nuclear powers themselves, offered to help India and Pakistan reduce tensions over the disputed territory of Kashmir. </p> <p> An athletic-looking Dane, with blond hair, blue eyes and an arrest warrant for armed robbery, hires a British arms dealer with a Walter Mitty complex. In Latvia, they buy a Russian cargo plane and have it flown to Bulgaria where it is loaded with 77 cases of weapons, including 300 assault rifles, ammunition, pistols, hand grenades and rocket launchers. </p> <p> The lumbering plane then heads east to India. When it gets over the village of Purulia, near Calcutta, the weapons are shoved out, drifting down under parachute rigging purchased in South Africa. The deal is financed out of Hong Kong. The intended recipient is a violent religious sect. </p> <p> President Clinton has agreed to travel to Russia in early September to meet with President Boris N. Yeltsin, although the Russian legislature has not fulfilled a request to ratify an important arms control treaty signed with the United States, the White House announced today. </p> <p> The two Presidents have made a practice of annual summit meetings, but for more than a year the White House had postponed responding to Mr. Yeltsin's invitation to Russia. </p> <p> Rogue nations could develop and deploy ballistic missiles for an attack against the United States with ''little or no warning,'' an independent commission announced today. </p> <p> But senior American intelligence officials today stood by their longstanding estimate that no country besides Russia and China, which already have ballistic missiles, could field long-range rockets before 2010, with the possible exception of North Korea. </p> <p> The unanimous conclusions of the bipartisan commission, headed by former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, provide fresh ammunition for supporters of a national missile defense, and sharpen an election-year issue that Republicans want to wield against the Administration and Democrats in Congress. </p> <p> ''It's a very sobering conclusion,'' said Speaker Newt Gingrich, a strong supporter of national missile defenses, who called on the Administration to work with Congress to address the heightened threat as described in the report. </p> <p> The United States has spent nearly $50 billion since the Reagan Administration to build a space- or land-based defense against ballistic missile strikes, but has yet to construct a workable network. </p> <p> Indeed, a report this month by the General Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, concluded that it is unlikely that a program to develop a national missile defense will meet an important deadline in 2000. </p> <p> In a 1996 deal with Congress, the Clinton Administration agreed to design and test a national defense by 2000 and then determine whether the technology was successful and whether the threat warranted deployment by 2003 at the earliest. </p> <p> But Republicans are seeking to field a system as soon as the technology is proved. </p> <p> The commission did not address the merit of any particular defensive system, focusing instead on the ballistic missile threat. </p> <p> ''The major implication of our conclusions is that warning time is reduced,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said. </p> <p> Mr. Rumsfeld has advocated continued research on the Strategic Defense Initiative, the space-based missile-defense system first outlined by former President Ronald Reagan, and he served as Presidential campaign chairman for Bob Dole, whose national security platform included a pledge to deploy, by 2003, a system to protect the United States against ballistic missiles. </p> <p> The commission singled out North Korea, Iran and Iraq for scrutiny.  ''We judge that Iran now has the technical capability and resources to demonstrate an I.C.B.M.-range ballistic missile'' similar to a North Korean model, its report said. </p> <p> But in a letter sent to Congress today, George J. Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence, said the Government stood by a threat assessment first made in 1995 and reaffirmed most recently in March. </p> <p> The Government assessments, Mr. Tenet wrote, ''were supported by the available evidence and were well tested'' in an internal review. </p> <p> But in its 300-page classified report delivered to the House and Senate today, as well as in an unclassified 27-page version, the panel said the American intelligence community was wrong in relying on the much-longer warning times. </p> <p> Mr. Rumsfeld said rogue nations, such as Iran and Iraq, had obtained sensitive missile technology, in part because of loosened export controls among industrialized nations. ''Foreign assistance is not a wild card,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said. ''It is a fact of our relaxed post-cold war world.'' </p> <p> Mr. Rumsfeld also said that suspect countries had become adept at concealing their missile programs, making it more difficult for Western intelligence analysts to gauge a country's progress and intentions. </p> <p> Senior intelligence officials told reporters today that the commission had examined the same information available to Government analysts, but had reached different conclusions. The officials said that they focused on specific evidence, assigning degrees of certainty to each assessment. They said the panel, whose official name is the Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States, took the same information, assumed the worst about what was not known for a particular country's missile program, and drew its conclusions. </p> <p> Mr. Rumsfeld concurred. ''We came at this subject as senior decision-makers would, who have to make difficult judgments based on limited information,'' he said. </p> <p> For that reason, the report, though praised by Republicans in particular, is likely to stoke debate over the missile threat rather than be viewed as the definitive conclusion. </p> <p> Mr. Rumsfeld said the panel reached different conclusions because it reviewed classified information about ballistic missiles that was not available to most analysts. </p> <p> A senior intelligence official acknowledged today that Mr. Rumsfeld had ''put his finger on a serious problem,'' and that intelligence agencies would work to relax the barriers that segregate, for security reasons, the dissemination of information among analysts. </p> <p> ''A new strategic environment now gives emerging ballistic missile powers the capacity, through a combination of domestic development and foreign assistance, to acquire the means to strike the U.S. within about five years'' -- 10 years for Iraq -- ''after a decision to acquire such a capability,'' the report concluded. </p> <p> Republicans appointed six members to the commission, Democrats three. The members include R. James Woolsey, the former C.I.A. director; Barry M. Blechman, former assistant director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency; physicist Richard L. Garwin; William R. Graham, former science adviser to President Reagan; William Schneider Jr., a former arms control adviser; Paul D. Wolfowitz, a senior Pentagon official under President Bush; and two former heads of the United States Strategic Command, Gen. Lee Butler and Gen. Larry D. Welch. </p> <p> Iran's test of a medium-range missile on Wednesday apparently blew up in the later stages of the flight, American officials said today. But they said they did not know whether it had blown up on its own or whether the Iranians had detonated it on purpose before impact. </p> <p> The missile traveled far enough and well enough, however, to sharpen concern in Washington, Israel and the Persian Gulf countries about Iran's growing capacity to deliver weapons of mass destruction in an arc that encompasses Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and parts of Egypt and Russia. </p> <p> Iran successfully tested a medium-range missile today, a senior Administration official said tonight. The weapon, with a range of about 800 miles, is capable of hitting Israel and Saudi Arabia, he said, and thus has the potential to alter the political and military balance of power in the Middle East. </p> <p> ''This weapon would allow Iran to strike all of Israel, all of Saudi Arabia, most of Turkey and a tip of Russia,'' said the senior Administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. </p> <p> Foreign Minister Yevgeny Prima kov of Russia  long the K.G.B.'s top operative in the Middle East and still Saddam Hussein's closest ally -- sees himself as a new Andrei Gromyko. </p> <p> Unlike that Soviet stoneface, Primakov represents no superpower. But because he now runs Boris Yeltsin's foreign policy, and because he has the latest Russian missiles to sell, this Gromyko with a smiling face has found a way to split the NATO alliance by inflaming Greeks and Turks over the island of Cyprus. </p> <p> THE Treasury's announcement on Monday that it would soon privatize the Government's half-century-old uranium enrichment plants made waves largely because of the proposed method of sale. While an initial public offering of shares in a Government-owned corporation is not unprecedented, it is certainly a novelty in keeping with the spirit of the high-flying stock market. </p> <p> But the more important news is that the Treasury is moving forward in spite of years of warnings that the sale would undermine a key initiative for containing nuclear proliferation. For once the United States Enrichment Corporation is privatized, the company will have powerful financial incentives to find a means to back away from an agreement to import 500 tons of bomb-grade uranium from Russia. </p> <p> A $12 billion deal to turn surplus bomb uranium in Russia into fuel for American nuclear power plants is threatened by recent moves that will cut uranium prices and give Russia less revenue. </p> <p> The governmental agreement, drawn up in 1992, was intended to prevent Russia's highly enriched uranium, the fuel for the simplest nuclear bomb, from falling into the wrong hands and to provide hard currency to the cash-starved Russian Government. </p> <p> Throughout the 1980's, the Soviet Union threw almost every weapon it had, short of nuclear bombs, at the Afghan camps attacked by the United States last week. </p> <p> During their nine-year occupation of Afghanistan, the Soviets attacked the camps outside the town of Khost with Scud missiles, 500-pound bombs dropped from jets, barrages of artillery, flights of helicopter gunships and their crack special forces. The toughest Soviet commander in Afghanistan, Lieut. Gen. Boris Gromov, personally led the last assault. </p> <p> The United States remains the world's biggest arms merchant, filling the developing world's arsenals with billions of dollars of weapons, but Russia and France are poised to overtake the United States, a new Government report says. </p> <p> The study, by the Congressional Research Service, says the United States retained its No. 1 position in the arms trade, which it has held for seven years, by selling $15.2 billion worth of weapons last year, a 44 percent share of the shrinking global arms market. </p> <p> With the monetary crisis in Russia creating turmoil in global financial markets, concern grew in European capitals today that the crisis could throttle economic growth in their own countries or weaken Russia's commitment to democracy. </p> <p> But with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany in the fight of his life for re-election a month from now and with President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin both seen to be in weakened political positions, few here saw much chance of quick, decisive action during the United States-Russian summit meeting planned for next week in Moscow. </p> <p> Almost nostalgically, it seemed, Russia reopened its cold war phrase book today to denounce the United States for its cruise-missile attacks on Afghanistan and the Sudan. But in almost the same breath, it declared that the differences would have no effect on President Clinton's trip to Moscow 10 days from now. </p> <p> On Russia's far-north Kola Peninsula, where he was witnessing naval exercises, President Boris N. Yeltsin said he was ''outraged'' by news of the American attacks and in particular by Mr. Clinton's failure to warn of them in advance. Afghanistan is on the southern border of the fraternity of former Soviet nations now called the Commonwealth of Independent States. </p> <p> President Clinton delivered a sober lecture to Russian leaders and the Russian people today about the hard realities of capitalism and the price of international support for relief from Russia's current financial crisis. </p> <p> In meetings with President Boris N. Yeltsin and the temporary caretakers of Russia's paralyzed political and economic institutions, and in a speech to students at a Moscow university, Mr. Clinton warned that there is no easy escape from the financial catastrophe that has closed banks, left millions of workers unpaid and caused the collapse of the Government. </p> <p> During the frigid days of the cold war, American satellites watched for the fiery launchings of Soviet missiles, a sign that the United States might soon be under nuclear attack. </p> <p> Now that the nuclear standoff is over, the United States has found a new use for its warning systems. It plans to employ them to alert the Russians about missile launchings around the world. </p> <p> The Administration today intensified its threat to use force against the Yugoslav military and the police, as Washington continued diplomatic efforts to persuade President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to end the crackdown in Kosovo. </p> <p> And in a move to maintain NATO unity behind military action, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright wrote to the group's 15 other members over the weekend to urge them to give NATO's commanders the authority to use force against the Serbs in Yugoslavia. Some allies resist that step; a vote on approving force, which was to take place in Brussels on Wednesday, has been delayed to the end of the week at the earliest. </p> <p> The United States and NATO worked today to keep the military pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia as he continued to resist complying with international demands to withdraw Serbian troops and police forces from the province of Kosovo. </p> <p> A day after NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, met with Mr. Milosevic and Yugoslav military leaders to demand more withdrawals, there were no signs today that any of the forces were in fact pulling back, NATO and Administration officials said. </p> <p> The history of American anti-Communism is being rewritten as we speak. The impetus is the emergence of recently declassified files in Russia and the United States that were secret for decades. These documents have confirmed that Soviet intelligence gained a foothold in the American Government in the 1930's and 40's, and that Russian spy masters could count on their comrades in the United States for support. </p> <p> In the wake of these disclosures, there is baseless concern that dangerous anti-Communists, notably Senator Joseph McCarthy, will be rehabilitated. In fact, historians have long been aware of Communist spying. The files are a treasure trove for researchers, but the overall effect of the new information is not surprising. Furthermore, McCarthy, who was censured by the Senate in 1954 and died of alcoholism three years later, had no part in the great espionage dramas of his time. What set him apart was his enthusiasm for lying on a grand scale. </p> <p> As the United States continued to build up its forces for a possible attack on Iraq, an eerie silence on the diplomatic front has made this crisis different from previous confrontations with Saddam Hussein. </p> <p> This time, there were no last-minute efforts to mediate with the Iraqis, no high-level Russian or French envoys rushing to Baghdad and no plans for Secretary General Kofi Annan to intervene, as he did in February when the United States last threatened to attack. Mr. Annan, who returned this afternoon from an aborted trip to North Africa, will not meet the Security Council until Friday. </p> <p> Iraq threw up a new roadblock to the work of United Nations arms inspectors yesterday, less than a week after agreeing to cooperate. </p> <p> In the latest twist in the dispute between the United Nations and Iraq over the prohibited arms, Iraq balked at handing over documents on chemical and biological weapons and missile systems. </p> <p> When Andrei B. Sokolov came to this nuclear city more than 30 years ago, it was a bastion of privilege for the Soviet Union's scientific elite. </p> <p> Its very existence was a state secret. Behind barbed-wire fences and hidden inside a mountain, three nuclear reactors produced tons of plutonium for the country's nuclear arsenal. Its scientists, the nation's brightest, lived the Soviet dream: the best food and wages the Kremlin could provide. </p> <p> The Security Council voted unanimously today to condemn Iraq and demand that President Saddam Hussein rescind his ban on cooperation with United Nations arms inspectors. But the Council stopped short of authorizing or even mentioning the use of force to back its demand. </p> <p> The resolution, making formal the outrage first expressed by Council members on Saturday after Iraq effectively shut down the arms monitoring system, comes in the face of reports that the United States may be preparing for military action against Iraq. </p> <p> One of America's most daring acts of piracy took shape late one night in 1970 as Capt. James F. Bradley Jr. of the Navy sat in his Pentagon office, meditating on how to achieve a nearly impossible goal. </p> <p> Captain Bradley, according to a new book, was wondering whether American spy submarines could somehow learn to tap the welter of undersea cables that encircled the Soviet Union like necklaces, heavy with communication jewels. </p> <p> Driven by budget constraints as much as diminishing security threats, Pentagon officials are quietly recommending that the Clinton Administration consider unilateral reductions in the nation's nuclear arsenal. </p> <p> Since the United States has already commited itself to drastic cuts in the arsenal, the Pentagon believes that the reductions would have no effect on America's ability to deter a nuclear adversary. </p> <p> As delicate negotiations over a new international policy on Iraq go on behind the scenes here, President Saddam Hussein is complicating his situation in the Security Council with a stream of bellicose statements against not only his enemies in London and Washington but also friends like Russia and France and his Arab neighbors. </p> <p> In addition, Iraqis are sending mixed signals about their remaining ties with the United Nations, which administers a huge relief program in the country. Iraq has already said it will never allow arms inspectors back, but it has generally cooperated with aid workers. </p> <p> Russia recalled its ambassador to Washington today for consultations as a protest for United States' air strikes against Iraq, Moscow's angriest riposte against American policy since the end of the cold war. </p> <p> The Kremlin's decision to withdraw Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov came as politicians across Russian's political spectrum, usually divided over how to solve the country's own tangled problems, united today and denounced the American attacks. </p> <p> In the last two days, as United Nations arms inspectors abruptly left Iraq and military strikes began, divisions in the Security Council have reverted to cold war patterns, diplomats said today. </p> <p> Russia has demanded the resignation of the chief weapons inspector, accusing him of being dishonorable in his dealings with the Council and  colluding with Washington to set Iraq up for attack. China has taken a similar line, and has also assailed the American bombing. </p> <p> An inevitable price of the United States' and Britain's use of force in Iraq is that it arouses considerable unease around the world, especially if it is later judged to have failed. </p> <p> Although only Russia has publicly vented irritation at the United States' decision to punish President Saddam Hussein, many other governments, especially in the Middle East, have watched the attacks with consternation, either from uneasiness about any nation that would take on itself the role of global policeman, or from concern about local repercussions, or from unanswered questions about what the United States is trying to achieve. </p> <p> Diplomats from 60 countries meeting here this week pushed to speed the deployment of 2,000 monitors to Kosovo province in Serbia. </p> <p> With 45 foreign ministers in attendance, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe bolstered its commitment to the biggest mission it has ever faced: the task of assembling unarmed monitors to hinder clashes between the Yugoslav military and ethnic Albanian rebels. </p> <p> President Clinton's decision to strike Iraq tonight without the customary round of consulting allies drew sharp criticism from Russia and France, the two countries most reluctant to use force against Saddam Hussein. </p> <p> While Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright talked to some 16 foreign ministers of the Security Council and European and Arab allies before the bombing began, her purpose was more to inform them of the American decision than to seek their counsel, officials said. </p> <p> Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright pressed the Russian Foreign Minister today for a Russian commitment to limit cooperation with the Iranian missile program. </p> <p> An American official said Ms. Albright, who is here for a NATO meeting, had reminded Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov that the United States provided financial support to keep Russian scientists from going to work on foreign weapons programs and had urged the Russian Government to ''make a maximum effort'' to limit technology transfers. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration, under pressure to make some concession to other Security Council members after the Iraq bombing, may be willing to consider closing the file on nuclear inspections, diplomats and independent arms control experts said today. </p> <p> By the time the Security Council assembled this morning to begin what is expected to be weeks of assessing where the United Nations goes next on Iraq, it was apparent to diplomats that the United States would have to compromise on something if other arms inspections -- of biological, chemical and missile systems -- are to continue. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration is urging its European allies to embark on a new initiative to combat weapons of mass destruction, as an example of the kinds of new threats a modernized, post-Soviet NATO must deal with in the next century, senior American and NATO-country officials say. </p> <p> In a meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Brussels on Tuesday and Wednesday, called to set the agenda for the 50th anniversary NATO summit meeting to convene here in April, the Americans will propose a new NATO Center for Weapons of Mass Destruction, commonly referred to as ''W.M.D.'' </p> <p> Despite Moscow's anger over the bombing of Iraq, and the recall of its Ambassador from Washington, Russian officials' private conversations with Americans reflect a desire to take the edge off the acrimony, senior American officials said today. </p> <p> Russian fury has been easing from its peak on Wednesday, the Americans said, with the most positive conversation yet occurring this morning between Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. </p> <p> With foreign powers competing for influence in the soon-to-be-rich lands surrounding the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan, potentially the richest of them, has made a startling offer. It wants the United States to open a military base there. </p> <p> The offer could give the United States its first permanent military presence on the territory of the former Soviet Union. Even if the base does not materialize, the offer suggests that Azerbaijan, where American oil companies have invested billions of dollars, is eager for a military partnership with the United States. But in addition to giving the United States greater influence in the Caspian region, any such partnership might draw the United States into alliances with undemocratic governments. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration today announced a far-reaching plan to end the fighting in Kosovo that calls for NATO air strikes if the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, refuses to grant Kosovo autonomy. </p> <p> Talks between the two sides are expected to begin in Europe next week. If ethnic Albanian separatists who have been fighting for independence resist the plan, NATO could impose a blockade on the coast of Albania to cut off the flow of arms to the guerrillas. </p> <p> Russian leaders responded with silence today to a White House proposal to overhaul the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty to permit the construction of defenses against missile attacks. </p> <p> That was no surprise. Russian strategists have long been deeply opposed to altering the treaty. To some here, the surprise was that the White House made the offer at all, as it is sure to anger legislators pondering the fate of a far weightier accord, known as Start 2, to reduce both nations' stocks of nuclear weapons. </p> <p> Listening to President Clinton's perfectly focus-grouped State of the Union speech the other night, I really felt sort of cheated. I mean, he left almost no constituency untickled by his 77-minute goody-bag of proposals. There was something for older women, younger women, black women, tall women, short women, soccer moms, soccer coaches, native Americans, Hispanics, non-smokers, free-traders, short bald men and protectionists. Even the First Lady got ''I love you.'' There was something for everyone except me -- except for foreign affairs columnists who still care about things like Russian nuclear weapons aimed at us. </p> <p> No, no, you say, the President declared that ''We must expand our work with Russia to safeguard nuclear materials.'' But I thought that was a laugh line. After all, for the last five years Mr. Clinton has had a signed treaty on the table with the Russians -- Start 2 -- that would require Moscow to slash the number of its long-range nuclear warheads aimed at us, from around 6,000 to 3,000. But the Clinton team chose to trade Russia's immediate ratification of Start 2 for NATO expansion. That's right, they traded the elimination of 3,000 Russian warheads for the Polish Air Force and the Czech Navy! </p> <p> The Administration said today that it was asking Russia to renegotiate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to permit a limited national system of missile defenses. </p> <p> The White House acted after concluding that the threat of a strike from a rogue state like North Korea justified building a limited number of ground-based interceptor missiles that could shoot down incoming missiles. The system is not designed to protect the nation from an all-out nuclear attack. </p> <p> In his State of the Union Message on Tuesday night, President Clinton will insist that the United States substantially increase its financial assistance to Russia to minimize the threat posed by the Russian nuclear arsenal, Administration officials say. </p> <p> ''The President believes it's in the national security interest of the American people that we work with Russia and other former Soviet countries to reduce the risk that materials, technology and expertise for weapons of mass destruction fall into the hands of rogue nations or terrorists,'' David Leavy, a National Security Council spokesman, said today. </p> <p> The Security Council, divided by radically differing Russian and American proposals for dealing with Iraq, began discussion today of a ''third way'' proposed by Canada. </p> <p> The Canadians are hoping to fill the void between what are basically hardened Russian and American policies with new information on which to base future talks on new programs for monitoring Iraqi weapons and insuring adequate supplies of necessary goods to Iraqi civilians. </p> <p> Richard Butler, the embattled chairman of the commission charged with disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, said today that he did not expect to seek another term as chairman but that he would strongly resist any effort to oust him. </p> <p> In an interview today, Mr. Butler coupled his intention to leave when his contract expires in June with strong criticism of Russia, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. </p> <p> I ran into the Russian reform party leader Grigory Yavlinsky in Europe two weeks ago and asked him a simple question: ''Grigory, when America wakes up from its impeachment nightmare, what kind of Russia will we find?'' </p> <p> He thought about that for a moment and said: ''You will find a Russia that is even more of a threat to you than the Soviet Union. Frankly, it's more of a threat to its own people. That's what I care about. But it is also more of a threat to you.'' </p> <p> North Korea is on the verge of developing ballistic missiles capable of hitting the continental United States, the Director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, told Congress today. </p> <p> North Korea's Communist Government appears to be working to produce nuclear weapons covertly and to extend the range of its ballistic missiles in ways that have surprised United States intelligence agencies, American officials have said. </p> <p> The United States has urged Russia to set up a joint missile-warning center before the end of the year to reduce the risk that the year 2000 computer problem might touch off a false nuclear alert. </p> <p> The proposal was made in talks last week between American and Russian defense officials, a senior Pentagon official said today. </p> <p> A study to be issued today by the Government's own auditors is highly critical of a key part of the Clinton Administration's effort to stop the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons by helping to employ scientists from the former Soviet Union on peaceful projects. </p> <p> The study of two Energy Department programs by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, concludes that American aid may have instead supported scientists still working in Russia on projects related to weapons of mass destruction. </p> <p> A coalition of nuclear-weapons experts called on the Clinton Administration today to revive stalled arms-control negotiations with Russia by making a series of bold and, if necessary, unilateral gestures to reduce nuclear stockpiles and build confidence. </p> <p> In a report issued here, the Committee on Nuclear Policy, which represents a variety of arms-control organizations and research groups, said the Administration was losing the initiative by waiting indefinitely for the Russian Parliament to ratify the second strategic arms reduction treaty, or Start II, before taking new steps to reduce nuclear weapons. </p> <p> The Clinton White House seldom lets a popular parade pass by without leaping to the front, or at least latching onto the last carriage. In years past, President Clinton was a late but fervent convert to Republican crusades on the balanced budget, Internal Revenue Service abuses and a Federal law discouraging same-sex marriages. </p> <p> Mr. Clinton has now again joined a popular cause, this time national missile defense, the latest version of the much-derided ''Star Wars'' anti-missile program of the Reagan era. Mr. Clinton added $6.6 billion for missile defense to his Pentagon budget request in January and this week dropped his opposition to a bill  he had threatened to veto. </p> <p> Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov of Russia is due in Belgrade today, with the stated purpose of stopping NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia and laying the groundwork for a peaceful settlement of the crisis. </p> <p> As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stressed to Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov when they talked by telephone yesterday, the precondition for a return to diplomacy is an end to the frenzied slaughter that Serbian soldiers, police officers and paramilitary gangs are carrying out against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. If that is Mr. Primakov's message to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia today, the mission may help. If not, it won't. </p> <p> Alarmed by the prospects of a widening war in the Balkans, President Boris N. Yeltsin dispatched Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov today on a high-risk mission to Belgrade Tuesday to coax President Slobodan Milosevic back to the negotiating table. </p> <p> Russia will insist first on a halt to the NATO bombing, which top officials here again described as an barbaric act of aggression. </p> <p> NATO officials said today that Slobodan Milosevic's goal in Kosovo was to carve out a Serb-only enclave in the province that he could hold onto after the fighting had ended. </p> <p> ''We have the impression that there is a campaign under way to ethnically re-engineer the inside of Kosovo, to achieve a solution more acceptable to him,'' said the chief spokesman for NATO, Jamie P. Shea. </p> <p> A Russian delegation met here today with the United States special envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, before attempting to travel by road to neighboring Yugoslavia to present a peace plan to President Slobodan Milosevic. </p> <p> The three prominent liberal politicans from Moscow warned that NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia had severely damaged Russia's relationship with the United States. </p> <p> A masked gunman tried to fire a grenade launcher at the United States Embassy today, igniting a gun battle that left the building pockmarked with bullet holes. </p> <p> While the embassy has been the scene of angry protests over NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia in recent days, the motive for today's attack was not clear. The gunman and at least one accomplice escaped without giving any indication of their purpose. </p> <p> The Energy Department chose six commercial nuclear power plants today, in the Carolinas and Virginia, to burn plutonium from nuclear weapons stockpiles, and selected a consortium involving the Duke Power Company, Stone & Webster and Cogema Inc., a French nuclear company, to make the fuel. </p> <p> The Energy Department will pay the consortium $130 million to design a plant to make the fuel, but will not ask Congress for money to build the plant until progress is made in negotiations with Russia to dispose of their own weapons plutonium, department officials said today. President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin have agreed in principle that each side should dispose of 50 tons of plutonium, enough for thousands of bombs, either by using it as reactor fuel or mixing it with highly radioactive waste. The Energy Department is trying to do both. </p> <p> I don't know about you, but I slept particularly well last Friday night, knowing that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic had just joined NATO. What? You say you were too disturbed by the reports of the Clinton team's lackadaisical response to potential Chinese pilfering of U.S. nuclear secrets to sleep well? You say you had insomnia over the fact that our nuclear arms control regime with Russia is crumbling? </p> <p> Well, to you I say, ''Don't worry, be happy.'' I read in my own newspaper that the Clintonites are planning to bring Slovenia into NATO next, and if that doesn't make you sleep better, I can't help you. You must be one of those nuts who still think that the most important strategic issue facing the U.S. is all the nuclear weapons pointed at us from Russia. </p> <p> Just after 1 P.M. today, an angry Russian Prime Minister, en route to Washington for some of the most important talks of his short tenure, ordered his pilot to turn his Ilyushin airliner around and return to Moscow. </p> <p> Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov was a few hundred miles northeast of Newfoundland when he received a satellite telephone call from Vice President Al Gore. Mr. Gore grimly informed him that a diplomatic effort had failed and that the United States and NATO were preparing to deliver a barrage of air and missile strikes against Serbian targets in Kosovo and Serbia. </p> <p> If NATO's diplomats get their way, next month's 50th birthday party in Washington will be replete with post-cold-war symbolism, featuring top Russian officials in its large cast to demonstrate just how well the old enemies now work side by side. </p> <p> There is just one small problem: Russia has not yet decided whether it wants the part. </p> <p> Russia introduced a Security Council resolution today demanding an immediate end to NATO's  air strikes against Yugoslavia, denouncing them as a ''threat to international peace'' and a ''flagrant violation'' of both the United Nations Charter and Yugoslav sovereignty. </p> <p> The resolution, which faces almost certain defeat when the  Council considers it on Friday, was introduced by Sergey V. Lavrov, Russia's representative to the United Nations. A spokesman for Mr. Lavrov said the measure was intended to underline Russia's view that military action is illegal and destabilizing. </p> <p> As Yugoslavia's Ambassador to Russia, the elder brother of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has done his best to drum up support for Yugoslavia in Moscow. </p> <p> So far, though, Borislav Milosevic  does not have much to show for it. </p> <p> The White House and Senate Democrats today abandoned their longstanding opposition to a politically popular bill that calls for a national defense against limited long-range missile attacks. </p> <p> The actions today all but assure overwhelming approval of the overall bill, which declares it to be United States policy to field a system against ballistic missile threats from rogue nations like North Korea and Iran as soon as ''technologically possible.'' </p> <p> Russia has offered to curtail nuclear cooperation with Iran if Washington ends sanctions against two leading Russian nuclear research centers, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister says. </p> <p> The proposal comes as Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov prepares for critical talks in Washington next week on security issues and Russian appeals for billions of dollars in credits from the International Monetary Fund. </p> <p> Stung by NATO's decision to carry out air strikes against Yugoslavia, Russia tonight suspended cooperation with the Western alliance and denounced the attack as an act of brazen aggression. </p> <p> Behind the words, however, was a tempering factor: Russia still needs billions of dollars in Western loans. </p> <p> Caught up in the belligerent hysteria that has filled the sidewalks in front of the American Embassy here for the last three days, Aleksei Yermakov could not have been happier. </p> <p> ''Look around, there are only young people,'' said Mr. Yermakov, a 40-year-old interpreter, grinning at the black-jacketed youths shouting obscenities and throwing eggs, beer and paint at the embassy's mustard yellow walls. ''Isn't it wonderful?'' </p> <p> Since the cold war ended, no other event has so divided the West and Russia as the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. The chasm is so deep that even words have taken on opposite meanings. While Americans and Europeans talk about the ''genocide'' of Kosovo Albanians by Serbs, many Russians talk about the ''genocide'' of Serbs by American bombs. </p> <p> Here, the chief villains are President Clinton and NATO, variously described as fascists and bullies. President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, widely identified in the United States and Europe as the man responsible for a vicious campaign of ''ethnic cleansing,'' is seen by many here as a defiant patriot, defending the sovereignty of a country attacked by foreign aggressors. </p> <p> With the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia so far unable to deter the atrocities in Kosovo, and the United States unwilling to commit ground troops, the idea of arming the Kosovo guerrillas has garnered support from a number of politicians and former policymakers. </p> <p> The Kosovo Liberation Army offers ''a credible, capable and willing alternative to the deployment of Americans,'' Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, wrote to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright on Thursday. </p> <p> No, President Boris N. Yeltsin did not order Russian nuclear missiles to be targeted at NATO countries taking part in the bombing of Yugoslavia. Nor did he formally endorse the joining together of Russia, Belarus and Yugoslavia in a geographically awkward Slavic union. </p> <p> But at a meeting today with Gennadi Seleznyov, the Communist who is the Speaker of the Russian Parliament's lower house, he unmistakably warned the West not to push Russia into another war in the Balkans. </p> <p> The United States has quietly warned Russia against providing military intelligence or assistance to Yugoslavia, senior Western officials said today. </p> <p> The confidential warning follows bitter complaints from Moscow about NATO's air strikes and the Kremlin's decision to dispatch a Russian spy ship toward the Adriatic, where the American aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt and other alliance ships have been participating in the air campaign against Yugoslavia. </p> <p> A  senior Yugoslav Government official, the second this week, spoke optimistically today about the possibility of a negotiated settlement to the war over Kosovo. </p> <p> ''I believe that this will be the week in which the basic outline of an agreement on Kosovo can be firmed up,'' Goran Matic said today. </p> <p> Senior American and Russian officials met today to discuss competing notions of how Kosovo could be resettled and administered once hostilities end, as Moscow moved increasingly into a role as mediator in the lengthening Balkan conflict. </p> <p> Before leaving Moscow for Germany, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott gave a positive assessment of his meetings with Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, a former Prime Minister who has been appointed Russia's special envoy for Kosovo. </p> <p> President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia agreed in a telephone conversation today to work closely together in the search for a solution to the conflict in Kosovo. They spoke as leaders of NATO concluded a summit meeting with pledges to intensify their air campaign against Slobodan Milosevic. </p> <p> White House officials said Mr. Yeltsin initiated the call and asked Mr. Clinton to place the next one after doing ''some thinking.'' </p> <p> The Russian Foreign Minister said today that Moscow remained opposed to an international security force in Kosovo as part of a peace plan without the approval of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. </p> <p> This fundamental difference between Russia and the United States appeared to blunt any prospect that real progress would be made soon toward a diplomatic solution. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration has approached Moscow to serve as a go-between with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia in a new attempt to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict in Kosovo. </p> <p> Vice President Al Gore called Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov of Russia by telephone and spoke to him for 40 minutes today, asking his help in getting the Yugoslav leader to take steps that would lead to a diplomatic solution, Mr. Gore's office said. </p> <p> A senior intelligence official at the Energy Department said today that his superiors and other Clinton Administration officials repeatedly downplayed or dismissed evidence that China had stolen nuclear weapons secrets from a Government weapons laboratory. </p> <p> The official, Notra Trulock, who was in charge of analyzing the case for the Energy Department, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that in some instances, senior officials made it clear to him that information about the suspected espionage at the Los Alamos National Laboratory would harm the credibility of Government laboratories, hurt their efforts to work with scientists in China and Russia, and might be used by Congress to attack President Clinton's China policies. </p> <p> A senator intelligence official at the Energy Department said today that his superiors and other Clinton Administration officials repeatedly downplayed or dismissed evidence that China had stolen nuclear weapons secrets from a Government weapons laboratory. </p> <p> The International Monetary Fund warned today that global economic growth could slow in 1999 and perhaps into 2000, hurt by weakness in Russia, Asia, Brazil and some regions of Europe, notably those ravaged by the Kosovo conflict. </p> <p> The group's latest world economic outlook said that ''several hurdles could prevent global growth from returning to potential within two or three years.'' </p> <p> With NATO bombing of Serbia now in its 18th day, a senior allied diplomat said here today that the alliance was prepared to continue air attacks ''for many more weeks'' but that the idea of using ground troops was not being seriously discussed. </p> <p> ''There's agreement in the alliance that the air campaign is having its effect, but that there's a lot more time left before it has run its course,'' the official said. ''The issue of ground troops is not being debated in a formal or serious way within the alliance.'' </p> <p> Five weeks into the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the Clinton Administration is faced with three choices in the Kosovo war, all disagreeable: an open-ended air campaign, the dispatch of ground troops, or compromise in a diplomatic solution. </p> <p> None of the options offers a quick solution. President Clinton suggested today that bombing could last into the summer; preparing for an armed invasion could take months, and a negotiated resolution would have to span a yawning chasm between NATO and President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslav. </p> <p> The German Government is pressing a Western diplomatic initiative aimed at isolating the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, rather than dealing with him. The strategy is driven by the conviction that he will almost certainly be indicted by the international war crimes tribunal. </p> <p> Germany, whose ties to Russia are close, was at the center of diplomatic activity today directed chiefly at securing Moscow's support for NATO's objectives in Kosovo, and thus reducing Mr. Milosevic's room to maneuver, Western officials said. No sign emerged today of any immediate breakthrough in the discussions that began on Tuesday with a visit to Moscow by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, but Western officials held out hope that Russia, Mr. Milosevic's chief if not enthusiastic supporter, might shift its position. </p> <p> President Slobodan Milosevic spent nine hours today with a Russian peace envoy but appeared to give very little ground. </p> <p> The Russian envoy, former Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, left Belgrade late tonight saying that Mr. Milosevic had agreed to an ''international presence in Kosovo under United Nations auspices,'' to implement any political settlement. </p> <p> Last time, they hung white sheets from their windows. That was in 1991 when the United States started lobbing cruise missiles into Baghdad. But it was not Iraqis who were waving the traditional flag of surrender -- it was peace-minded Germans. Never mind that they were not the targets. They wanted to demonstrate their moral superiority in the face of American ''cowboy imperialism.'' </p> <p> These last few days, we have seen no such displays of righteousness in Europe. Indeed, as the pounding of Yugoslavia goes into its second week, the most intriguing news from Europe is that the dogs of peace have not been barking in the night. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin fired off another peace offensive today, even as a Russian military reconnaissance ship was heading into the Mediterranean in a open demonstration of Moscow's anti-NATO stance in the Yugoslavia conflict. </p> <p> Appearing today on national television, Mr. Yeltsin called for an emergency meeting of the foreign ministers of the world's seven leading industrial powers, plus Russia, to seek a political settlement in the Balkans. </p> <p> NATO has rejected Slobodan Milosevic's latest move, a unilateral cease-fire, as insufficient for the bombing to stop, but again it is the Yugoslav President who is creating the facts to which the West is responding. </p> <p> And Mr. Milosevic appears to be constructing a new form of reality in Kosovo that will be harder for the Washington and NATO to dismiss out of hand. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration was right to reject Slobodan Milosevic's cease-fire proposal -- entering into negotiations now with Serbia, which has largely achieved its military goals in Kosovo before NATO has achieved much of anything, would be an admission of defeat. </p> <p> So why, then, has Vice President Al Gore called on Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov of Russia at this moment to work on an agreement with the Serb dictator? Playing the Russian card now legitimates Mr. Milosevic's horrendous actions in Kosovo and exposes the weakness of the NATO alliance. </p> <p> A Russian-led peace initiative for Kosovo appeared to make little headway today, with Moscow and the West divided over the composition of any international force in Kosovo and the Yugoslav Government in defiant mood. </p> <p> Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's Balkan envoy, held talks in Bonn with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany, and declared afterward, ''There's progress, but no breakthrough.'' </p> <p> Britain and the Netherlands proposed today that the United Nations Special Commission, known as Unscom, be replaced by a new enlarged body to carry out more intrusive inspections of Iraq's suspected weapons sites. </p> <p> The resolution was circulated to the Council's 15 member nations the same day that the Russian representative to the United Nations, Sergei Lavarov, boycotted a briefing of the Security Council by Richard Butler, the chief United Nations arms inspector, calling his latest report on Iraq's weapons programs ''a waste of time.'' </p> <p> The NATO bombing of Yugoslavia may or may not free the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, but a thousand miles away, it has already had a profoundly liberating effect. After eight long-suffering years, it is once again acceptable -- even de rigueur -- for Russians to dislike Americans. </p> <p> Enough Russians have embraced animosity, and with such sudden fervor, that some experts here say it threatens to become the guiding force in a relationship with little else going for it. </p> <p> Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, on her first visit to NATO headquarters since the bombing began, arrived here tonight for a gathering of foreign ministers intended to show that the 19 members of the alliance are unified behind the air strikes against the Belgrade Government. </p> <p> Anxious to counter the assertions of Yugoslav leaders that NATO will soon weary of the air campaign over Serbia, officials said the alliance would meet on Monday to reaffirm its demands on President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, including the withdrawal of his troops from Kosovo and the return of ethnic Albanian refugees. </p> <p> There cannot be security and stability in the world without Russia. </p> <p> NATO intensifies its bombing of Serbia to the cheers of a fair portion of the Western political and intellectual elite. The bombing has rallied Serbs behind their dictator, Slobodan Milosevic, who is using the air strikes as a cover and pretext for mass expulsions, massacres and hostage taking. As NATO bombing continues, outrages against the Kosovars seem certain to continue. The weapons used against the Kosovars are not easily countered from the air. </p> <p> President Clinton called President Boris N. Yeltsin today to press for Russian participation in a political resolution in Kosovo that would involve Russian troops in an international security force there, White House officials said. </p> <p> The conversation, the first between the two leaders since the NATO air assaults began on March 24, had a sense of urgency, reflecting a perception that the longer the bombing dragged on, the more difficult a political outcome involving the Russians would become, according to an official who listened to the 45-minute conversation. </p> <p> Russia announced today that it is sending a military reconnaissance ship to the Mediterranean to monitor the conflict in Yugoslavia, a move criticized by the United States State Department as unhelpful as NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia intensifies. </p> <p> At a news conference today, Defense Minister Igor D. Sergeyev confirmed that Russia had notified Turkey of plans to dispatch seven vessels from its Black Sea Fleet through the Bosporus in two flotillas this month. </p> <p> As Serbia tried to clean up today after NATO's heaviest bombing raids so far, Serbian television once again gave prominence to images of a moderate ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, showing him in meetings with a senior Yugoslav official and the Russian Ambassador. </p> <p> State television said that Mr. Rugova, who is living in Pristina, the Kosovo capital, under what Serbian authorities describe as police protection, met there today with the Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister, Nikola Sainovic, and the Russian Ambassador to Belgrade, Yuri Kotov. The men were shown in a living room with unidentified journalists and photographers present. </p> <p> Mr. Rugova and Mr. Sainovic, a television announcer said, called for an end to the bombing in Kosovo and agreed to work for a peaceful negotiated solution, with the safe return of all refugees. Mr. Rugova, who has always favored a non-violent path to Kosovo's self-rule and, ultimately, independence, was quoted as saying he was ''prepared to continue work here so everyone can see I'm still in Kosovo and trying.'' </p> <p> Mr. Rugova was also said to have confirmed that he had met last week with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevicin a session shown on Yugoslav television. One NATO official has questioned the authenticity of the videotape, and Belgrade television said that Mr. Rugova's reported statement today ''has caught NATO in a lie and revealed the propaganda war waged against our country.'' </p> <p> But in an intriguing follow-up, the television also quoted Mr. Rugova as saying he would like to go abroad. </p> <p> ''I am interested in going to Skopje and other countries,'' the announcer quoted him as saying, ''because I am here without my associates, and in Pristina I cannot contribute to the solution of the problem.'' Skopje is the capital of Macedonia. </p> <p> As usual, there was no audio accompanying the video footage, and no way to verify that Mr. Rugova had said any of the words attributed to him. NATO has said that Mr. Rugova is under house arrest; that he has not called for an end to the bombing, but for an end to violence in general; and that footage of his meeting with Mr. Milosevic was actually two years old. </p> <p> The official news agency Tanjug, discussing Mr. Rugova's meeting today, said: ''Rugova himself used the occasion to reject Sunday's statement of NATO spokesman Jamie Shea that he had not met President Slobodan Milosevic, and that the pictures taken on April 1 could be two years old.'' </p> <p> Mr. Kotov, Tanjug continued, confirmed that Mr. Rugova ''is safe and alive, that he is free to move.'' </p> <p> Efforts this evening to reach the Russian Embassy for comment were unsuccessful. Mr. Shea said in Brussels: ''I think we are going to have to wait until the end of the this conflict in Kosovo to learn all of the facts about Rugova, and therefore I probably should reserve judgment.'' </p> <p> Western officials are concerned that Mr. Milosevic will suddenly announce a political deal with Mr. Rugova for substantial political autonomy for Kosovo, much along the lines of a Western-drafted solution that Mr. Rugova signed in France, but without a role for the Kosovo Liberation Army or NATO peacekeepers. </p> <p> Mr. Rugova has lost popularity and credibility with the fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army, but he  has retained significant support among ordinary ethnic Albanians. If he is a willing participant in a deal with Mr. Milosevic, many Albanians will regard him as a traitor, but others may welcome a chance to return home in peace. </p> <p> Senior Yugoslav officials have said privately that Mr. Milosevic still believes an internal political solution is possible for Kosovo, while other officials who have his ear are pressing for a form of partition that would keep the northern half of the province for Serbia and effectively cede the rest. </p> <p> But NATO is unlikely to accept either option. </p> <p> In widespread bombing early this morning, NATO struck at military targets and civilian infrastructure that the military could conceivably use for resupply. Allied forces destroyed the empty Yugoslav Air Force headquarters in Zemun, a municipality of Belgrade, and damaged  surrounding buildings. In Nis, 125 miles south, the headquarters of the 3d Army was demolished, along with an army barracks. </p> <p> Tonight, at about 9:30, Nis was hit again by ''six or seven cruise missiles,'' television reported. The nearby town of Aleksinac was also struck tonight, as was Novi Sad. </p> <p> As usual, no figures for military casualties were released. </p> <p> But many Government buildings are empty, and even state television, expecting to be bombed, is said to have moved to hardened bunkers. </p> <p> As an American envoy arrived here for talks on Kosovo, Russia's Foreign Minister said today that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia was prepared to make concessions, but that NATO would also have to bend if the conflict was to be brought to an end. </p> <p> The remarks by the Foreign Minister, Igor S. Ivanov, came a day after President Boris N. Yeltsin telephoned President Clinton about Kosovo, and coincided with the arrival of Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott to pursue the possibilities of Russian mediation. </p> <p> Joining in the search for a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Kosovo, leaders of 15 European Union countries presented a plan today under which the province would be placed under temporary international European administration if President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to withdraw his forces and allowed hundreds of thousands of Albanian refugees to return. </p> <p> American officials gave the European initiative, and a more detailed  one made public separately by Germany today, little chance of being accepted by Belgrade. NATO reiterated that it would continue bombing  in Yugoslavia until Mr. Milosevic withdrew all police and military units from Kosovo and let the ethnic Albanian population go back home. </p> <p> Officials said today that Belgrade has agreed to let a United Nations mission visit Yugoslavia, including Kosovo, to assess relief needs, and the leader of an advance team representing several agencies left immediately for Belgrade. </p> <p> Sergio Vieira de Mello, the Undersecretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, announced that the trip was on after Vladislav Jovanovic, Yugoslavia's representative here, delivered a letter welcoming the mission and assuring that Belgrade would facilitate the trip. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration, anxious to find a political solution to the Kosovo conflict as soon as possible, managed to get the Russians on its side today. </p> <p> In so doing, Washington and the allies, calculating that isolating President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia was critical to setting the stage for negotiations, finessed several of their key demands and made it clear that there was room to maneuver on the composition of an international security force. </p> <p> The West and Russia agreed for the first time today on the need for an international military presence in Kosovo to keep any eventual peace. But the composition of such a force and conditions for its deployment remained in dispute. </p> <p> An agreement reached here today by Foreign Ministers from the Group of Seven richest nations and Russia was a decisive step away from the specter of a wider conflict between Washington and Moscow over the Balkans. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin's foreign-policy aides greeted the new framework for peace in Kosovo with a hint of pleasure at their return to the diplomatic spotlight and a determination that the country not appear to be merely a tool of the West. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin's domestic advisers could not help but regard it as a small but significant victory for the President, who has struggled to control Russia's policy on Yugoslavia in the face of ever more militant -- and popular -- anti-Western oratory by Communist and nationalist forces. </p> <p> EURO UP FURTHER.  The euro rose for a third day as Russia agreed on the need for an international military presence in Kosovo, increasing speculation on a peace agreement. In New York, the euro rose to $1.0802 from $1.0741. </p> <p> Jeremy J. Stone, having accused a prominent American physicist of spying for Moscow while involved in the making of the first atomic bomb half a century ago, has now written him to accept his denial that he was the Soviet atom spy whom the Russians called Perseus. </p> <p> Mr. Stone, president of the Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington, laid out his suspicions in a chapter of his new memoir, ''Every Man Should Try: Adventures of a Public Interest Activist'' (Public Affairs, 1999). The book referred to the physicist only as a ''Dr. X,'' but Mr. Stone, after initially refusing to identify him, did so once the physicist identified himself to a reporter as the object of Mr. Stone's suspicions. </p> <p> German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said here today that Germany was counting on a diplomatic outcome to the war in Kosovo, with the backing of Russia, in the next several weeks. </p> <p> Echoing strong statements by the German Chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, Mr. Fischer stressed that Germany opposed NATO forces entering Kosovo unless a settlement was first reached with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. </p> <p> Negotiations toward a political settlement over Serbia seemed to inch forward today when the Russian mediator, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, met outside Moscow with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland. </p> <p> But at the same time, Russia registered its unhappiness with NATO by breaking off its military contacts with the alliance. </p> <p> Reflecting frustration over his organization's marginalization in Kosovo, Secretary General Kofi Annan criticized the United States today for taking military action without Security Council blessing and China and Russia for having ignored the ethnic purging that led to NATO's bombing. </p> <p> In a speech at The Hague commemorating the centenary of the first International Peace Conference, Mr. Annan did not identify those Security Council members by name, but he warned that the inability of the 15-member Council to achieve consensus on Kosovo and other critical issues threatened both the United Nations and international peace. </p> <p> Under increasing public pressure to resolve the conflict in Kosovo, President Clinton said today that he would not rule out the use of ground troops but that he was hopeful that diplomatic efforts under way with the Russians would be successful. </p> <p> ''I and everyone else has always said that we intend to see our objectives achieved and that we have not and will not take any option off the table,'' Mr. Clinton told reporters at the White House when asked if he was reconsidering using ground troops to expel Serbian forces from Kosovo. </p> <p> The turmoil in Russia today appeared to represent another impediment to the  Clinton Administration's hopes of finding a diplomatic end to the war in Kosovo. </p> <p> After dismissing his Government, President Boris N. Yeltsin threatened to withdraw from negotiations on Kosovo, saying that Moscow's proposals were being repeatedly ignored. </p> <p> President Clinton held an extended discussion today with the Russian special envoy for the Balkans. But the White House remained pessimistic about the prospect of a deal anytime soon to end the Kosovo conflict. </p> <p> White House officials expressed gratitude for Russian efforts to broker a peace, but said the bombing of Yugoslavia would continue unabated until President Slobodan Milosevic had bent to allied demands. </p> <p> After more than 50 days of air raids and with his troops still entrenched in Kosovo, President Slobodan Milosevic is prepared for a settlement, so long as the process can be portrayed as negotiation and not capitulation, Yugoslav officials and analysts say. </p> <p> There is a consensus that Mr. Milosevic has the political room to maneuver over Kosovo and to redefine almost any negotiated outcome as a victory to preserve his own grip on power. </p> <p> In a development that could complicate Russia's role in the Kosovo crisis, rebels fighting for the territory's independence claim to have killed a Russian captain in a battle with Serbian troops in Kosovo. </p> <p> Officials of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army said that the dead man was just the latest in a list of Russians who have been killed in Kosovo, and that they had known for months that Russian officers and soldiers were fighting with Serbian troops. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration announced today that the United States would press its allies to move quickly to deploy what was described as a peacekeeping force totaling 50,000 troops on the borders of Kosovo. </p> <p> After recent days of public debate and private planning, NATO is now likely to take up the issue as early as next week. The forces are intended to be used to help return the Kosovar Albanian refugees and to police any agreement reached with the Serbs. </p> <p> Yugoslavia insisted today that it must play a central role in negotiations within the United Nations to end the war and bring a political settlement to Kosovo, and that Belgrade would not simply let NATO dictate a solution. </p> <p> ''Read my lips,'' the Foreign Ministry spokesman, Nebojsa Vujovic, said in English. ''It's not about NATO. It's about the U.N.'' </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia today condemned the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade as ''yet another flagrant violation of international law'' by NATO leaders and called on them to end their military action in Yugoslavia immediately. </p> <p> ''This is a blatant outrage, and there can be no justification for it,'' Mr. Yeltsin said in a statement released by the Kremlin. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration struggled today to prevent the accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade from either hobbling NATO's air campaign or stifling the nascent diplomatic search for a way to end the war over Kosovo. </p> <p> The White House said the American Ambassador in Beijing, James Sasser, had apologized to the Chinese Government and would continue to provide Chinese officials with information on how the accident happened. </p> <p> By dispatching his special envoy to Washington for talks on ending the Yugoslav conflict, President Boris N. Yeltsin has put Russia at the center of international diplomacy, reviving relations with Washington and NATO. Perhaps more to the point for Mr. Yeltsin, it also plays well at home. </p> <p> The move has quieted the hard-line critics who have lamented Moscow's dwindling influence, and has even enabled the President to settle a few scores with some of his political rivals. </p> <p> President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia insisted in an interview released here today that Yugoslavs were ''willing to die'' to defend what he called their right to Kosovo, but at the same time outlined what he described as a six-point plan for settlement of the war. </p> <p> In a rare insight into his thinking, Mr. Milosevic rejected the idea of a foreign military force in Kosovo that NATO has demanded, but said the United Nations ''can have a huge presence if it wishes.'' He said these United Nations peacekeepers could bear sidearms for self-defense and include troops from non-NATO nations. </p> <p> A Russian envoy said tonight that he had made some progress toward a peace settlement after another six hours of talks with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, but NATO officials were dismissive. </p> <p> The Russian negotiator, former Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, told Russian reporters that he had made ''solid progress'' in his second meeting with Mr. Milosevic in just over a week. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration today played down the divisions among its NATO allies over the air war against Yugoslavia, in what appeared to be a conscious effort not to accentuate those differences as delicate talks for a peace settlement were under way. </p> <p> The latest disagreement among allies -- Germany's dismissal of British support for the use of ground troops -- erupted as the Russian envoy, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, presented the allies' demands on ending the war to the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, in Belgrade. But behind the scenes, Cabinet members and even the President were on the telephone trying to repair the breach. Mr. Clinton held a 90-minute conversation with Prime Minister Tony Blair on Tuesday night. </p> <p> Undeterred by calls from China and Russia to halt the bombing of Yugoslavia, American and other allied forces pounded targets across the country today as NATO leaders pledged to continue the air war until President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to meet all their demands. </p> <p> After relatively quiet nights following the bombing on Friday against the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, NATO aircraft hit 37 targets overnight on Monday, including their first strike on Belgrade since Friday.  With clearing skies, NATO pressed the attack virtually without pause through the day and night today, American and NATO officials said. </p> <p> Russia's special envoy on the Kosovo crisis, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, met on Tuesday with China's top leaders to discuss the issue, as rage continued to boil here in response to the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. </p> <p> But early today, with demonstrations halted at least temporarily, the American Ambassador, James Sasser, walked out a back door to leave the embassy for the first time since Saturday, when angry demonstrations began. He planned to greet American families in nearby diplomatic residential compounds and then return to the embassy, where officials were hoping they could resume their work. </p> <p> A week after NATO missiles hit the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, China and the United States hammered out a formal statement late Friday night expressing the Security Council's ''deep distress and concern'' about the attack. </p> <p> A deal was struck shortly before midnight when China agreed to drop an explicit statement of ''shock'' about the missile strike in exchange for the milder language. </p> <p> Word that President Slobodan Milosevic may be indicted for war crimes on Thursday, the day a Russian envoy is due here to discuss a peace settlement for Kosovo, stunned Serbs tonight, dampening hopes for an end to the war. </p> <p> As the Government cracked down on antiwar dissent, charging an elected official with treason, a former confidant of Mr. Milosevic suggested that the Yugoslav leader  might intensify the conflict by carrying it to Montenegro, Serbia's sister republic. </p> <p> The international tribunal in The Hague has decided to indict Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav President, for war crimes and will formally announce the action on Thursday, Western officials said today. </p> <p> The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to specify the charges for which Mr. Milosevic is to be indicted. But Louise Arbour, the chief prosecutor of the tribunal, began an investigation into responsibility for war crimes in Kosovo last year, and has intensified her inquiries in recent weeks. </p> <p> Negotiations toward a solution to the Kosovo crisis broke up unusually late tonight with no clear evidence of progress, but representatives of Russia, the United States and the European Union planned to try again on Thursday. </p> <p> Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, the American representative, said there had been ''good talks,'' but declined further comment. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration has concluded that an indictment of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia on  charges of war crimes would not preclude direct negotiations on Kosovo with the Serbian leader, senior American officials said today. </p> <p> ''We don't rule out further contacts if they are necessary to achieve our objectives and further our national interest,'' said a senior Administration official. </p> <p> The NATO allies now believe they will need nearly twice the 28,000 peacekeeping troops they originally planned to station in Kosovo in a negotiated settlement, allied and American officials said today. </p> <p> American and other NATO officials said the alliance would need perhaps as many as 50,000 soldiers to enforce any Kosovo settlement, even if NATO bombing eventually forced President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to accept allied demands to stop attacking ethnic Albanian civilians in the province, withdraw Serbian forces and let the refugees and peacekeepers enter unopposed. </p> <p> Western allies and Russia have narrowed their differences over a future international force in Kosovo to the point where they will be able to issue a joint statement Thursday on ending the conflict in the Serbian province, American and NATO officials said today. </p> <p> A senior German official said an outline accord had been reached with Russia on the need for ''an international civil and security presence'' that would enter Kosovo under a United Nations mandate after an eventual withdrawal of Serbian forces. </p> <p> While NATO leaders congratulated themselves on Thursday for nudging Russia over to their side in the search for a diplomatic settlement in Kosovo, Russian diplomats took another view, claiming a small but significant victory in their monthlong attempt to mediate a peace. </p> <p> Seen from Moscow, the document signed in Bonn on Thursday by the foreign ministers of Russia and the Group of Seven industrial countries had the ring of a compromise, a classic example of diplomatic give and take. </p> <p> President Clinton today described the peacekeeping operation in Bosnia as a model for the force that is envisioned to return and protect ethnic Albanian refugees to Kosovo. </p> <p> Mr. Clinton said that the arrangement, which includes American soldiers working under the direction of NATO with United Nations approval, was a good model because it involved Russian and Ukrainian participation even though NATO was involved. </p> <p> The bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade is expected to complicate, and could even undermine, efforts by the United States and other NATO members to win United Nations endorsement of an international peacekeeping force for Kosovo, Administration officials acknowledged tonight. </p> <p> China, which has a veto in the United Nations Security Council, has steadfastly opposed the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia and has made clear its suspicion about the motives of the Western alliance. </p> <p> When Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland and Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia sat down to talk about Kosovo this week at Stalin's old dacha outside Moscow, they pulled up an empty chair. The fourth chair, according to an American official, was to remind them at all times that the key figure in their endeavor was not there. </p> <p> In fact, since his indictment on Thursday on charges of war crimes by the international tribunal in The Hague, it has been virtually certain that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia would never sit in that fourth chair, at least not with an American present. As an indicted war criminal, he is unlikely to join in negotiations with NATO. </p> <p> We are in Kosovo with our allies to stand for a Europe, within our reach for the first time, that is peaceful, undivided and free. And we are there to stand against the greatest remaining threat to that vision: instability in the Balkans, fueled by a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing. </p> <p> The problem is not simply ethnic hatred, or even ethnic conflict. The people of the former Yugoslavia have lived together for centuries with greater and lesser degrees of conflict, but not the constant ''cleansing'' of peoples from their land. Had they experienced nothing but that, their nations would be homogenous today, not endlessly diverse. </p> <p> NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade threatens to drag out a diplomatic solution in Kosovo and to inflict long-term damage on an already-troubled relationship between the United States and China, officials said today. </p> <p> Although Clinton Administration officials were confident at first that the crisis would soon blow over, they now see signs that the Chinese Government may delay a United Nations Security Council resolution requiring an international security force in Kosovo, a senior Administration official said. That resolution is at the heart of a proposed diplomatic settlement of the conflict. </p> <p> The United States is planning to begin dropping supplies to the half-million  Albanians forced from their homes and hiding in the Kosovo hills with little food or medicine, the State Department announced today. </p> <p> ''The U.S. has been preparing a strategy for airdrops, and we are going to be doing airdrops, hopefully, starting two weeks from tomorrow,'' said Julia Taft, Assistant Secretary of State for Refugees. </p> <p> Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the stolid former Russian Prime Minister, and Al Gore, the stolid American Vice President, are engaged in an intensive search for a diplomatic exit to the bloodshed in the Balkans, an effort that brings some risk to both men, but potentially large benefits. </p> <p> Over the past two days, Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin conducted a movable meeting that migrated from Mr. Gore's small quarters in the West Wing of the White House to the Oval Office to the exercise room of Mr. Gore's official residence. </p> <p> Clinton Administration officials said today that they believe they have persuaded the Russian envoy to the Balkans that a military force, rather than just a monitoring mission, would be needed in Kosovo after the bombing campaign. </p> <p> The White House outlined some details of the talks that the envoy, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, held on Monday with President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. Mr. Chernomyrdin continued his diplomatic efforts today at the United Nations, where he met with Secretary General Kofi Annan. </p> <p> Secretary General Kofi Annan announced today that he intended to send a mission to Yugoslavia to assess relief needs, but faced immediate skepticism from the United States and Russia. </p> <p> Mr. Annan said the Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Sergio Vieira de Mello, wrote today to the Yugoslav representative here to request permission for the team to enter the country. United Nations relief agencies have not been in Kosovo since shortly after the NATO bombing began on March 24. </p> <p> Slobodan Milosevic kicked off the negotiations with his usual historical harangue. </p> <p> The Serbian strongman lectured a Russian envoy, Victor S. Chernomyrdin, and President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland on Wednesday on the meaning of Kosovo to the Serbs. </p> <p> After meeting for more than five hours with NATO officials on the border of Kosovo, Yugoslav military officers failed today to agree to the terms of their withdrawal from the southern Serbian province, saying they needed more time to check with leaders in Belgrade. </p> <p> Five senior Yugoslav military officers came here today to meet with top NATO commanders in order to review and sign NATO's terms for their withdrawal from Kosovo after 10 weeks of bombardment by the alliance. </p> <p> Are we witnessing a diplomatic victory that will bring peace to the Balkans? Or will President Clinton win the Neville Chamberlain memorial umbrella trophy for accepting a phony peace? Let us hope for the former -- although much evidence suggests the latter will come to pass. </p> <p> It would have been difficult to achieve peace even if Slobodan Milosevic had fully accepted NATO's demands: stop the ethnic cleansing, pull all Serb forces out of Kosovo, allow all Kosovo refugees to return home, accept a NATO military force in Kosovo and accept a politically autonomous Kosovo and an eventual plebiscite for full sovereignty. </p> <p> The Kosovo war has brought radical changes to the European continent, thrusting Germany into a leading military role not seen since 1945, galvanizing attempts to forge a common European defense policy and altering Europe's relationship with the United States. </p> <p> Of course, with Russian stability still deeply uncertain, and the abrupt movements of Russian troops in Kosovo suggesting that Moscow's military may be restive, Europeans remain wary of any ''decoupling'' from Washington. But the desire to maintain trans-Atlantic ties is now accompanied by a push to balance them in a new way. </p> <p> President Clinton and other senior American leaders spoke with their counterparts in Russia today but were unable to resolve the impasse over Russian troops that has marred the beginning of the peacekeeping mission in Kosovo. </p> <p> American officials tried to put the best face on the military and diplomatic mess, but it was clear that Russia and the United States remain far apart on critical questions arising from Russia's demand to take part in the Kosovo military operation on its own terms. </p> <p> NATO slowly expanded its control over a central swath of Kosovo today, pouring thousands more soldiers into major towns and villages but effectively ceding the airport here in the capital to about 200 Russian soldiers who defiantly occupied it three days ago. </p> <p> By this evening, NATO officials reported no new clashes today like  ones on Sunday. The force's commander, Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Jackson of Britain, said today that German and British troops who had opened fired in separate confrontations on Sunday in Prizren and Pristina, killing two Serbs, had acted justifiably when threatened. </p> <p> For many years the standard quip about NATO was that NATO existed to ''keep the Germans down, the Americans in [Europe] and the Russians out.'' In light of NATO's U.S.-led victory in Kosovo, though, that old cliche is going to have to be adapted. NATO's new mission is ''to keep the Balkans quiet, the Americans in and the Russians sweet.'' </p> <p> No one planned it this way, but managing the bloody turmoil in the Balkans, not the Eastern Front, and managing the zany, unpredictable weakness of Russia, not its strength, have now emerged as NATO's primary missions. Ever since the cold war ended, NATO planners have been groping for a new mission, a senior NATO official remarked to me at NATO's Brussels headquarters, and the Balkans is turning out to be it. </p> <p> If you can't get to the moon, Baikonur is not a bad approximation. The rocket range that bills itself as ''the Biggest Cosmodrome in the World'' is a bleak expanse of pitted flatlands, unbearably cold except when it is unbearably hot and impossibly remote. </p> <p> The features that make it a wretched place for humans were all points in its favor when Baikonur was chosen as the main testing facility for Russia's missiles and space rockets. It is possible to fire a test rocket 5,000 miles without landing in China or Turkey or Japan and with little danger of bombarding a major city. The skies are usually clear. The terrain is ideal for retrieving misfires. And there is no one around to snoop. </p> <p> Two weeks after the first NATO peacekeepers arrived in Kosovo, the first military aircraft landed here today at the province's main airport, which NATO commanders said could soon open to regular flights. </p> <p> A hulking Russian cargo plane touched down at 1:19 P.M., followed moments later by a French C-130 in what was an orchestrated effort to highlight the cooperation of Russian and allied troops after the diplomatic standoff caused when a contingent of Russians occupied the airport on June 12, hours before NATO's forces started streaming into Kosovo. </p> <p> The European Union today announced plans to provide $1.5 billion during the next three years for the reconstruction of Kosovo as the West tried to map out a strategy that would channel money to the war-devastated area without giving financial support to a Serbia controlled by Slobodan Milosevic. </p> <p> Gunter Burghardt, the director-general for the European Union's  Balkan policy, said the 15-nation bloc would provide $500 million annually over three years to Kosovo ''irrespective of whether Milosevic is there or not.'' He added that the Yugoslav President, indicted by the international war crimes tribunal last month, had to be isolated. </p> <p> When the Clinton Administration invited Russia to help it out of the war in Kosovo, the idea was that the involvement in big game diplomacy would help maintain Washington-Moscow ties, and even improve the ailing relationship. </p> <p> But now, as President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia is about to make his first foreign trip in four months on Sunday and to meet here with President Clinton, as many -- if not more -- questions are hanging over the dialogue as were before the war. </p> <p> With the key issue of the distribution of Russian forces in Kosovo still unsettled, American and Russian negotiators returned to the table tonight, with orders to work through the night. </p> <p> The Russian Defense Minister, Igor D. Sergeyev, and the Foreign Minister, Igor S. Ivanov, told their American counterparts early this evening that they would return to Moscow for consultations tonight. But they were persuaded instead to press ahead with work on a complex agreement defining Russia's role in Kosovo. </p> <p> Bill Clinton held firm. That was a crucial fact in the Kosovo war, and it should be recognized. Under savage criticism at home and abroad, the President stuck to his policy. And it prevailed. </p> <p> Right up to the denouement, critics predicted that the President would weaken his demands on Yugoslavia. A writer in The Times of London, Ben Macintyre, wrote: ''Clinton is seeking a diplomatic escape route that will allow him to cut his losses and save face. . . . It is the modus operandi of a man whose primary instincts are to vacillate, compromise and then gloss.'' </p> <p> The arrival of Russian troops in Pristina before dawn today raises disturbing questions about the Kremlin's control of the military. </p> <p> After the troops moved into Yugoslavia on Friday, Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov assured the Clinton Administration that the force would not enter Kosovo until Russia had reached an understanding with NATO. </p> <p> Breaking Moscow's assurances to Washington, a long column of Russian troops entered Kosovo and its capital early this morning amid wild celebration by local Serbs. </p> <p> The troops, who had been stationed in Bosnia as part of the peacekeeping force there, continued through Pristina to the suburb of Kosovo Polje, where they halted. </p> <p> The White House was first stunned and then bewildered tonight to learn that Russian troops had rolled into Pristina, the Kosovo capital, after receiving assurances from Moscow all day that its troops would not move in until NATO had given them a green light. </p> <p> After initial concerns that sent Administration officials into an hourlong emergency huddle and lighted up the phone lines to Moscow, the White House was reassured by Moscow that the advance into Pristina in fact was a mistake and that Russia was ordering the troops to leave immediately. </p> <p> As a military operation, it was insignificant. But as a symbol, there is no more potent metaphor for Russia's regard of the West than the image last weekend of 200 Russian soldiers seizing a Kosovo airfield, and then lining up armored personnel carriers to keep NATO troops out. </p> <p> Kremlin officials offered a strategic explanation for the move, involving the need to acquire bargaining chips in talks on Kosovo's future and to establish Moscow once and for all as a player in the peace process. </p> <p> In an effort to break an impasse over how Russian troops will operate in Kosovo, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen is to suggest to his Russian counterpart that the troops be allotted an ''area of responsibility'' within one of the five established NATO sectors, Administration officials said today. </p> <p> Mr. Cohen also plans to propose a command structure that he hopes will satisfy the Russians' demand that their troops not report directly to an allied commander, but will not violate NATO's insistence on a unified command for the entire security force, the officials said. </p> <p> Armed with thick repair manuals and rosters of experts, Russian officials have opened an all-out campaign to expel the so-called year 2000 bug from the nation's eight million computers, their microchips and their programs. </p> <p> But 60 miles south of the Kremlin in the little town of Stupino, Mike Tuffs is not waiting for the victory party. Mr. Tuffs, regional technology manager for Mars Inc., the American candy maker, asked the regional government and utility officials last year how they planned to deal with the bug. </p> <p> Prime Minister Sergei V. Stepashin told Parliament today that the military was in ''catastrophic'' condition and in need of money to improve its readiness and the condition of defense industries. </p> <p> He also noted that deploying peacekeeping troops in Kosovo would require additional expenditures. </p> <p> While talks were under way today in Bonn, NATO held back on carrying out threats to intensify its bombing of Yugoslavia if Belgrade did not promptly accept allied terms on Kosovo. But near midnight explosions and antiaircraft fire erupted in the capital, which had been quiet for several nights. </p> <p> [Serbian oil refineries, including one at Pancevo near Belgrade, were struck early on Tuesday, Reuters reported from the capital. The Batajnica suburb of Belgrade, site of a military airfield, was also bombed.] </p> <p> Administration officials expressed hope today that the snags in talks about Serbia's withdrawal from Kosovo would be resolved within days. </p> <p> White House aides acknowledged that they had been excessively optimistic after the agreement on Thursday by President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to NATO's terms for ending the 10-week conflict. And they implied that they had overreacted when the talks on the military details stumbled on Sunday. </p> <p> After eight hours of negotiations, Russia balked today at approving a resolution to be sent to the United Nations Security Council on the future of Kosovo and the role of 50,000 peacekeepers. </p> <p> But in other areas, considerable progress was made today when foreign ministers met near here, and the latest stumbling blocks may be resolved quickly. </p> <p> You don't need to be Clausewitz to figure out what finally brought Slobodan Milosevic to the negotiating table on NATO's terms and why he is now stalling again. The answer to both questions is Russia. </p> <p> The best way to understand Russia's critical role is to think of a divorce proceeding: You are negotiating a divorce with your wife. She has no lawyer and you have Johnnie Cochran. Every time your wife asks for something, Mr. Cochran steps in to protect you with a point of law. Things are going so well, you ask for a lunch break. When you come back from lunch you find that Mr. Cochran has switched sides and is now acting as your wife's lawyer, nodding in agreement at all her demands. You're in trouble. </p> <p> Germany today received a letter from the Yugoslav Government in which President Slobodan Milosevic said he was ready to withdraw forces from Kosovo and accept a ''United Nations presence'' in the Serbian province. </p> <p> But Mr. Milosevic also demanded an immediate end to NATO's 70-day-old bombardment if a settlement is to be reached and made clear that significant differences with the West remain. </p> <p> NATO military planners heard today how many troops and tanks the allies and other countries would provide for the beefed-up, 45,000-strong peacekeeping force planned for Kosovo if diplomacy brings a settlement there. But allied officials said Russia, a key diplomatic player, was keeping its distance. </p> <p> The allies kept up the pressure on Serbian forces with 778 missions overnight, including 319 bombing runs and 89 attacks on Serbian air defenses. Gen. Ljubisa Velickovic, a Yugoslav Deputy Chief of Staff, was killed in air strikes near Belgrade, military officials there reported. </p> <p> The reasonable face of Russia, President Boris N. Yeltsin, walked stiffly, but his presence here today was enough to reassure President Clinton and other Western leaders that dialogue with Moscow was possible in the aftermath of the Kosovo war. </p> <p> After weeks of tensions since the start of the war, culminating in an unnerving standoff between Russian and NATO troops at the main airport in Kosovo, the Russian and American leaders met today and decided to let bygones be bygones, according to Mr. Clinton's aides. </p> <p> Leaders of the seven wealthiest nations and Russia outlined a plan today for ending eight years of war in the Balkans through a vast program of aid and political support, but said Yugoslavia must undertake ''democratic and economic reforms'' to take part. </p> <p> At the end of a three-day summit meeting, the leaders of Britain, France and Germany said that in their view, democratic reform in Yugoslavia would have to involve the departure of President Slobodan Milosevic, but in deference to Russia no explicit reference to him was included in the final statement. </p> <p> Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said today that President Boris N. Yeltsin had authorized the early entry of Russian troops into Kosovo, a deployment that surprised American officials and possibly senior members of his own Government. </p> <p> At a Pentagon briefing today, Mr. Cohen declined to characterize the presence of Russian troops in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, as a mistake, a term widely used in the last 24 hours by various Administration, NATO and Moscow officials as they played down a Russian move that stole the spotlight from NATO's entry into Kosovo. </p> <p> Taking a tough line toward Russian troops who moved into Pristina without NATO's approval last night, the alliance's top general warned today that the commander of the NATO peacekeeping force had authority to order them to leave. </p> <p> Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the American commander of NATO forces in Europe, said here that the allies would welcome Russian participation in the force, but only under a command arrangement with the alliance. </p> <p> American diplomats and military representatives today held talks with Russian counterparts about how to make the best of the de facto presence of some 200 Russian soldiers in Kosovo. </p> <p> The talks, held in Moscow and Macedonia, were clouded by distrust and confusion over whether President Boris N. Yeltsin himself had ordered the deployment. </p> <p> Thousands of NATO troops with armored vehicles moved methodically into Kosovo today, hours after about 200 Russian soldiers infuriated and startled Washington by entering the Kosovo capital and taking up positions at the military airport. </p> <p> The embarrassing squabbling between Moscow and the West took some luster off NATO's triumphal entry into the blasted province after a 78-day bombing campaign, which succeeded in forcing the Yugoslav Government to cede effective control over Kosovo and allow the eventual return of more than a million refugees to what remains of their homes. </p> <p> Russia and the United States, ending three days of grueling negotiations, signed a military agreement today that integrates Russia into the Kosovo peacekeeping force, dividing most of the 3,600 planned Russian troops among three of five sectors led by NATO countries. </p> <p> The agreement broke a tense stalemate over Russia's role in Kosovo and opened the way for restoration of Russia's links to the Western alliance, which Moscow froze last March when NATO began airstrikes against Yugoslavia, Russia's historical ally in the Balkans. </p> <p> A few hundred Russian soldiers in Kosovo, commanded by a general who outranks the British lieutenant general who will be in charge of the 50,000 NATO troops there, have had the alliance tied up in knots since last weekend trying to figure out how Russians can be included without being under NATO command. </p> <p> In fact, allied officials said today, NATO's military relationship with Russia started going seriously wrong months ago, when Moscow tried to assign a senior military intelligence officer to the alliance's command headquarters in Mons, Belgium. </p> <p> The chief negotiators for Russia and NATO haggled for a fourth day to no avail today over how and where Russian troops would serve in a Kosovo peacekeeping operation. </p> <p> Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Russia's foreign minister, Ivan Ivanov, met for only about two hours before the talks broke up. Mr. Talbott said he was hopeful that the two sides could make progress. President Clinton and Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin also discussed the peacekeeping issue by telephone this afternoon, but agreed only to talk again. </p> <p> Russian soldiers occupying the Pristina airport blocked the entry of British troops today in an embarrassing impasse for NATO's nascent peacekeeping effort in Kosovo. </p> <p> While President Clinton discussed the stalemate with the Russian leader, Boris N. Yeltsin, by telephone,  British officers fumed that the place they had picked for their headquarters had, in effect, been confiscated.  Commanders spent much of the day, apparently without success, searching for an alternative site. </p> <p> Winston Churchill liked to tell the story of the man who tried to give the powder to the bear, and all the elaborate preparations he made to do so -- ''but the bear blew first.'' Decayed and decrepit though it is, the Russian bear blew faster than NATO when it came to sending peacekeepers into Kosovo. It taught us a lesson about speed and surprise -- and if it is true that NATO's advance into Kosovo was delayed to prepare for photo opportunities, then it was a lesson we badly needed. </p> <p> The Russian position on the ground is of course extremely weak. Unless Bulgaria gives permission for Russian overflights, it will be virtually impossible to reinforce the Russian forces in Kosovo, though they will doubtless be supplied by the Serbs. It is therefore in NATO's power to blockade the Russians and force them out. </p> <p> China and Russia repeated their demand today that NATO air strikes be halted before political talks to resolve the crisis in Yugoslavia begin. </p> <p> Russia's Foreign Minister, Igor S. Ivanov, spent the day meeting with China's top leaders, discussing their shared opposition to the NATO bombing campaign and their mutual desire to foster a ''strategic partnership'' aimed at offsetting the global dominance of the United States. </p> <p> Russian and NATO envoys delivered an incomplete draft of a peace settlement to President Slobodan Milosevic today, and after a two-hour meeting, Mr. Milosevic said he and his Government would study the proposals overnight and meet the envoys again at 9 A.M. Thursday. </p> <p> In a sign that Mr. Milosevic was taking this approach from the West and Russia seriously, leading legislators from Serbia's Parliament were hastily summoned to a late-night meeting to discuss the proposals. Serbian state television said there would be a special session of the Parliament on Thursday morning. </p> <p> Russia and the West narrowed their differences today over the measures required to end the war in Kosovo, limiting the room for President Slobodan Milosevic to maneuver and increasing the pressure on him to reach a settlement. </p> <p> ''We have found a common approach,'' said Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the Russian envoy to the Balkans, after a marathon negotiating session in Bonn with American and European officials that went on through much of Tuesday night and ended only this afternoon. </p> <p> European foreign ministers and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright pronounced themselves well satisfied today after haggling for 12 hours over the draft of a United Nations Security Council resolution on Kosovo. </p> <p> But their handiwork, which is supposed to provide the basis for an end to the war, leaves plenty of unanswered questions and some loopholes that could be exploited by President Slobodan Milosevic. </p> <p> An end to the war in Kosovo crept closer today with agreement among the United States, six allies and Russia on a plan to send peacekeepers into the shattered Yugoslav province, perhaps in a week. </p> <p> Shortly after the Russians, who had resisted certain provisions of the plan, dropped their objections at a conference in Cologne, Germany, NATO and Yugoslav generals reopened crucial negotiations at a remote site in Macedonia on detailed provisions for a withdrawal of Serbian troops from Kosovo. Negotiations on that subject, which had broken down over the weekend, continued into Macedonia's dawn. [Page A12.] </p> <p> When Russia's special envoy, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, went to Belgrade last week with the President of Finland to help resolve the Kosovo conflict, he was seen in the West as a heroic statesman. </p> <p> But no sooner did Mr. Chernomyrdin return to Moscow than he ran into a buzz saw of criticism. Communist lawmakers demanded that he be censured for working too closely with NATO. </p> <p> The deadlock between Yugoslav and NATO military officials negotiating in a tent on the barren Macedonia border was finally broken after some sharp exchanges nearly a thousand miles away in an elaborate 15th-century meeting hall. </p> <p> An irritated Russian Foreign Minister, Igor S. Ivanov, broke into a discussion among foreign ministers on another matter here late this afternoon. He charged that the Americans and NATO were responsible for the stalemate in the tent, according to Clinton Administration officials and other diplomats. </p> <p> Setting aside policy differences over Kosovo, Iraq and other contentious issues, the United States and Russia concluded an agreement in Washington yesterday extending for seven years programs to reduce the threat posed by nuclear, biological, chemical and other weapons of mass destruction. </p> <p> In a ceremony at the Russian Embassy yesterday morning, Russia's Ambassador, Yuri V. Ushakov, signed the agreement and shook hands with senior Defense Department officials to celebrate the extension of the umbrella agreement that authorizes the Cooperative Threat Reduction program. </p> <p> After seven hours of intense talks,  Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen and his Russian counterpart, Marshal Igor D. Sergeyev, said tonight that they had made progress toward a resolution of the touchy issue of Russia's role in the Kosovo peacekeeping force. </p> <p> But neither side was ready to predict with certainty that a final agreement would be ready on Thursday, when Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov join the marathon negotiations being held in the Presidential Palace here. </p> <p> On the 72d day of NATO's air war against Yugoslavia, President Slobodan Milosevic accepted an international peace plan today to end the Kosovo conflict and allow nearly one million ethnic Albanian refugees to return to what is left of their homes. </p> <p> After forcing most of those refugees to flee from Kosovo and enduring thousands of Serbian military and civilian deaths, Mr. Milosevic and the Serbian Parliament agreed rapidly to all key NATO demands after envoys from Russia and other European nations brought what they made clear was the best offer he was going to get from NATO. </p> <p> Despite its outspoken criticism of allied bombing raids, Russia played a vital role in advancing NATO's peace plan for Kosovo, Western diplomats and Russian officials said today. </p> <p> The Russian envoy, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, supported the two-page list of demands that President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland presented to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia during talks in Belgrade this week. </p> <p> Russian airborne troops flew into Kosovo today, starting the deployment of the main Russian peacekeeping contingent, a day after NATO and Russia worked out the last wrinkles to their participation. </p> <p> The arrival of about 200 Russians was greeted with general relief on the ground. It signaled the opening of Slatina airport, just west of the capital, Pristina, for military flights, and for the first United Nations relief flight today, which arrived with vital communications equipment. </p> <p> The Coca-Cola Company's major bottler in Central and Eastern Europe reported an unexpectedly steep drop in first-half volume sales yesterday and its stock fell sharply. </p> <p> The bottler, Coca-Cola Beverages, attributed the 5 percent decline in volume, measured in cases sold, to severe economic problems in Russia, the Kosovo conflict, the company's recent bottled-water recalls in Poland and bad publicity from Coca-Cola beverage recalls in Belgium and France, which were handled by a different bottler. </p> <p> Sergei V. Stepashin, the new Prime Minister of Russia, warned today that the United States should not assume the role of international policeman, a sign that relations between the two countries remain frayed by the American-led military intervention in Kosovo. </p> <p> Mr. Stepashin, in Washington to meet with President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and other American leaders, rejected the notion of a ''Clinton doctrine'' of intervention in internal conflicts in sovereign nations. ''It is very dangerous,'' he warned at a luncheon at the National Press Club. </p> <p> Reflecting its growing dependence on nuclear weapons for defense, Russia's military carried out mock nuclear strikes in a major exercise last month, the Defense Minister said today. </p> <p> The exercise was the largest since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. It involved 50,000 troops, bombers, tanks and warships from the Barents Sea to the Black Sea. </p> <p> The United States and its NATO allies have blocked Russia from flying hundreds of troops into Kovoso this weekend, before details of Russia's role in the NATO peacekeeping force could be worked out, Administration officials said today. </p> <p> In the last 48 hours, Russia asked Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria for use of their airspace to fly 10 planeloads of peacekeepers on Sunday into Pristina, the provincial capital, the officials said. But those nations rejected the request after consulting with top American and NATO officials, the Administration officials said. Hungary is a new member of NATO, while both Romania and Bulgaria would like to join the alliance. </p> <p> In what a Russian Foreign Ministry official here welcomed as the week of getting Russian relations with the United States back on track, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and the Russian Foreign Minister, Igor S. Ivanov, met here tonight in their first conversation since the Kosovo war.  They touched on the Balkans, where differences remain, but dwelt more on arms reduction, Iraq and economics. </p> <p> The discussion, after a daylong session of the annual meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, will be followed by meetings in Washington on Tuesday between the new Russian Prime Minister, Sergei V. Stepashin, President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. </p> <p> NATO and Russian military commanders resolved their differences over Russia's role in the peacekeeping operation in Kosovo today, clearing the way for about 3,600 more Russian troops to arrive in the Serbian province after weeks of wrangling. </p> <p> The first planeloads of Russian paratroopers could begin arriving as soon as Tuesday at Kosovo's main airport west of the capital, Pristina, alliance and Russian officials said. There they will join several hundred Russian troops who have hunkered down there since they entered Serbia on June 12, beating NATO peacekeepers by hours. </p> <p> Russian bombers flew close enough to Iceland and Norway last week to cause the United States and Norway to scramble fighter planes as a precaution, a National Security Council official said tonight. </p> <p> He said the eyebrow-raising incident, reminiscent of the kind of Kremlin muscle-flexing that was common during the cold war, occurred as part of Russia's largest military exercises since the breakup of the Soviet Union. The exercises, named West '99, involved up to 50,000 troops, more than 30 ships and Russian Air Force and naval aircraft. </p> <p> Despite an agreement reached in Helsinki almost two weeks ago, Russia and NATO are still arguing about exactly where Russian peacekeepers should go in Kosovo and whose orders they should follow, alliance officials said today. </p> <p> Russian military negotiators led by Vice Adm. Valentin Kuznetsov have been trying to work out the details in talks with the allied military command in Belgium but have insisted on letting their troops take orders only from Russian officers, not NATO ones, allied officials said. </p> <p> Several thousand Kosovo Albanians marched through this little town today, in the fourth day of peaceful protests against plans to station Russian troops among the NATO peacekeepers here. </p> <p> The Albanians assert that Russian mercenaries fought as members of  the nationalist Serbian militias that carried out a campaign of killing, looting and burning across the southwest corner of Kosovo and that the Russians would be overly solicitous of the handful of remaining Serbs. </p> <p> Serbian generals, touring the country to stanch protests and dismantle roadblocks set up by angry army reservists owed money for duty in Kosovo, are dousing one rebellious fire after another. </p> <p> At least for now, the generals have apparently succeeded in redirecting some of the rage from President Slobodan Milosevic toward the latest enemy of the Serbs -- Russia. </p> <p> The Russian authorities may have thought they would silence Grigory Pasko when they threw him into prison after he documented the navy's nasty practice of dumping nuclear waste at sea. </p> <p> But the crusading journalist has refused to go quietly. From behind the walls of a Vladivostok jail, Captain Pasko has resorted to a time-honored Russian practice: chronicling the dismal life inside the country's overcrowded and disease-infested prisons. </p> <p> Russian soldiers at three checkpoints were fired on overnight and four other checkpoints were attacked, a spokesman for the international peacekeeping forces said here today. Sixteen people were arrested, he added. </p> <p> While the spokesman, Maj. Jan Joosten, insisted that the overall security situation in Kosovo was improving, senior international officials said they were troubled by the rash of attacks on peacekeepers that has followed the killing of 14 Serbs in Gracko on Aug. 1. </p> <p> The White House and Senate Democrats say they are preparing for a pitched battle with the Republican-controlled Senate to save one of the top foreign policy goals of President Clinton's waning Administration: a treaty banning nuclear testing. </p> <p> Armed with public opinion polls and the support of many scientists, military commanders and arms control groups, Democrats are threatening to bring the Senate to a standstill when Congress returns next month from summer recess unless Republicans agree to hold hearings this year on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which 152 nations have signed. </p> <p> Russian warplanes bombed the Grozny airport in Chechnya today and set an oil refinery ablaze on the outskirts of the city, as the Kremlin took its military campaign against Islamic rebels deep into Chechen territory. </p> <p> The Russian bombing raids near Chechnya's capital represented a major stepping-up of the fighting and signaled a change of strategy. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin today mocked the Russian military's handling of an Islamic rebel invasion of Dagestan as inexcusably careless, joining a chorus of critics who say the nation's commanders appear to have learned nothing from their humiliating defeat by rebels in Chechnya three years ago. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin, palpably angry, appeared on national television as his security council debated what to do about the rebels, who seized villages along the border with Chechnya over the weekend and blew up an apartment complex housing Russian military families. </p> <p> Russia has asked the United States Energy Department to expand joint projects aimed at securing dangerous materials, including nuclear fuel, that could be turned into weapons, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said today on a visit here. </p> <p> Mr. Richardson said the proposal incorporated an unusual provision that would provide the United States greater access to highly sensitive sites to which Moscow has barred foreigners or permitted only limited entry. The offer, which Russian and American officials said was approved by Defense Minister Igor D. Sergeyev, was made by Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, Commander in Chief of the Russian Navy, at a private meeting today with Mr. Richardson and his senior staff. </p> <p> Four Britons were described today as suspected Communist agents, bringing the number of people recently accused of being cold war informers to eight and prompting calls on the Government to clarify why there had been no prosecutions and whether British security had been undermined. </p> <p> Robin Pearson, 43, postgraduate studies director at Hull University, was identified in a BBC documentary as a ''long-term penetration agent'' for East Germany, code-named Armin. Vic Allen, 77, a retired professor of economics at Leeds University, was said to have passed confidential information about the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament to East German intelligence officers, and Dr. Gwyneth Edwards, a German-language lecturer at Loughborough University, was accused of having collaborated with the East German secret police, the Stasi. </p> <p> A cache of stolen uranium was intercepted by Georgian officials this week, underscoring the continuing danger of nuclear theft in the former Soviet Union. </p> <p> Georgian officials said they confiscated a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of uranium-235 on Monday night just miles from the Georgian-Turkish border. </p> <p> Gen. Wesley K. Clark, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, ended the bombing of Yugoslavia more than three months ago. But this week he was still waging a high-intensity battle to convince allied public opinion that the bombing had been as effective in Kosovo as he said it was last spring. </p> <p> Backed by almost a squadron of allied military pilots and about 20 linear feet of secret bound folders of bomb-damage assessment reports, he took his campaign to the stage of a NATO news briefing auditorium here today. </p> <p> The 87-year-old suburban London woman who admitted that for decades she had furnished the Soviet Union with research documents from Britain's top secret nuclear weapons development program is a most improbable spy. </p> <p> Melita Norwood made her unrepentant confession Saturday in the well-tended garden of freesia and daisies in front of her two-story stucco home in Bexleyheath, southeast London. She was dressed in a wide collared lavender floral print blouse and gray tweed skirt and clutching a handwritten piece of paper with slightly trembling fingers. </p> <p> Islamic rebels continued their assault on Dagestan today, spurring fears that the Kremlin might lose control of the region. </p> <p> The Islamic militants have seized six villages in western Dagestan, including Novolakskoye. Fourteen Russian troops were killed on Sunday in fighting in that region. </p> <p> The United States and Russia, updating the ''hot line'' concept between leaders of the world's most heavily armed nuclear powers, opened a new state-of-the-art video-conferencing center today that will enable Russian and American nuclear officals to see, as well as talk, to each other during a nuclear-related emergency. </p> <p> Russia and the United States have agreed on the final details for a special command post in Colorado to insure that potential Year 2000 computer glitches in either nation's missile warning systems do not lead to an accidental launching of a nuclear warhead. </p> <p> After suspending cooperation to protest the United States bombing of Serbia last spring, Moscow relented and has agreed to cooperate on the command post at Peterson Air Force Base, in Colorado Springs, where Russian officers will sit side-by-side with American colonels to read data flowing in from American radar sites and satellites around the world. </p> <p> At least 10 explosions devastated a downtown market and maternity hospital in Grozny, Chechnya, on Thursday evening, according to accounts from the breakaway Russian republic. </p> <p> The explosions reportedly killed scores of people and injured hundreds more in a scene of panic and horror. Chechen officials told The Associated Press that at least 118 people died and more than 400 were injured, although the number could not be confirmed. </p> <p> The United States and Russia have quietly resolved a long-simmering dispute over the illegal sale of sophisticated I.B.M. computers to Russia's leading nuclear weapons lab, American officials said today. </p> <p> In the process both sides have helped open to cyberspace what was once one of the most secret installations of the Soviet Union. </p> <p> Speakers at a conference convened to press for ratification of the nuclear test-ban treaty suggested today that the ban might founder among other holdouts, including Russia and China, if it was not approved by the United States Senate. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration and Senate Republicans have maneuvered all week in advance of the floor debate on the treaty that is scheduled to start Friday. Both sides agree that the ban faces near-certain defeat if it comes to a vote, so the main debate has been whether, and how, to postpone the vote -- and keep the treaty alive -- until next year. </p> <p> As Western leaders urge Moscow to move quickly to a political solution to the war in the breakaway region of Chechnya, Russian generals are pressing for an all-out military victory against the Chechen rebels, and in unusually strident fashion warning Russian politicians to get out of the way. </p> <p> In recent interviews in the Russian news media, top army commanders now leading the campaign in Chechnya have said that this time, they will not be robbed of the victory that in their view was snatched from them in 1996 when Russia signed a treaty with Chechen leaders. </p> <p> Russia has suggested for the first time that it might support a weapons inspection system for Iraq that would be acceptable to Western nations if Washington gave Moscow a free hand in Chechnya, administration officials said yesterday. </p> <p> The proposed link was contained in an informal document that Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov gave Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright during a meeting Wednesday of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, in Istanbul. Administration officials seemed eager yesterday to reject even the possibility of such a deal. </p> <p> In Oslo the other day, the ex-K.G.B. man who is Russia's prime minister of the month delivered a letter from President Yeltsin to President Clinton: </p> <p> ''Dear Bill,'' I am told it began, ''I would like to share with you, in confidence and with the utmost candor'' -- and then a Kremlin spokesman put out, in less confidence, the guts of the letter: that if the U.S. proceeded to mount any defense of its territory against nuclear missiles, ''it would have extremely dangerous consequences for the entire arms control process.'' </p> <p> After enduring a decade of second-guessing over whether it failed to detect Communism's impending demise, the Central Intelligence Agency is still a bit defensive about its performance in the waning years of the cold war. </p> <p> But when the desire to set the historical record straight led the agency to cosponsor a conference on the subject with the George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University this weekend, the agency tried hard to produce a celebration of an intelligence victory. It even declassified 24 intelligence reports from the years 1988 to 1991 as proof that its assessments were more accurate than the critics have said. </p> <p> This was supposed to be a banner day for American-Russian cooperation. The American ambassador was scheduled to cut the ribbon at a gala opening of a United States-financed business center in one of Russia's closed nuclear cities. </p> <p> But after Russian authorities barred him last week from bringing his top science adviser or inspecting other American-Russian projects at the site, known as Krasnoyarsk-26, Ambassador James F. Collins angrily canceled his visit. </p> <p> World leaders ended a 54-nation summit meeting on European security today with the adoption of stiff new limits on the size of conventional armaments in Europe and a new charter proclaiming that local conflicts were the legitimate concern of all European states. </p> <p> But the main issue at the meeting of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe -- Russia's war in Chechnya -- yielded only a call for a political settlement and a future visit by an official of the organization, despite all the criticism heaped on Moscow by participants. </p> <p> When President Clinton's foreign policy team gathered in the White House to discuss Chechnya recently, briefers from the Central Intelligence Agency explained the Russian military strategy in detail. </p> <p> It boiled down to this: continued artillery and aerial bombardment of the breakaway republic; the destruction of the capital, Grozny, in an effort to flush out rebels, and the creation of even more civilian casualties and refugees, who are already spreading chaos through the Caucasus. </p> <p> Envoys of the five major powers at the United Nations ended several weeks of talks yesterday without agreeing on how to restart arms inspections in Iraq, diplomats said. </p> <p> The discussions will now go back to foreign ministers to resolve differences, while the Russians prepare to discuss the issue with the Iraqis next week. Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister and the government official responsible for dealing with the United Nations, is expected to arrive in Moscow early in the week for talks. </p> <p> The administration said today that it might go ahead with a national missile defense system, even if it meant withdrawing from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty over Russian objections. </p> <p> ''We will not permit any other country to have a veto on actions that may be needed for the defense of our nation,'' Walter B. Slocombe, undersecretary of defense for policy, said today in a speech at the Center for Strategic International Studies. </p> <p> A Navy code expert has been charged with passing secrets to Russia five years ago, military officials said tonight. </p> <p> The expert, Petty Officer First Class Daniel M. King, 40, was arrested on Nov. 5 after failing a routine polygraph test and is in custody at Quantico, Va., awaiting the military equivalent of a grand jury proceeding, the officials said. </p> <p> Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott ended two days of talks on a sour note here today, accusing Russia of ''indiscriminate killing'' in Chechnya and failing to break a lingering stalemate between Washington and Moscow over a major arms control treaty. </p> <p> As Russian forces continue to pound rebel positions in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, Mr. Talbott offered some of the harshest American criticism to date of the Kremlin's military campaign, which proved enormously popular in the parliamentary elections last week. He said Russia was violating ''international norms'' in Chechnya by treating civilians in Chechnya as ''terrorists.'' </p> <p> A few days before the United Nations Security Council is expected to vote on a new arms inspection system for Iraq, the Iraqi government threatened France yesterday with retaliation against its diplomats and oil companies if it supports the proposal. </p> <p> The government of Saddam Hussein apparently senses that it can no longer rely on France -- and perhaps not on Russia either -- to block the resumption of inspections after a year of indecision by the Security Council and no monitoring in Iraq. So  Iraq has gone on the offensive with articles in its controlled press and with comments from officials. </p> <p> Mikhail A. Kashpurin is a frail old man with years of valorous service in the Soviet Army, an unblemished labor record and a story to tell. </p> <p> And that story is this: He was in the wrong place at the wrong time. The place was Grozny, and the time was Russia's military campaign. </p> <p> The world's biggest industrial countries, meeting with Russia in the Group of 8, today issued another condemnation of Moscow's actions in Chechnya and called for an immediate cease-fire there. </p> <p> Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright warned that Russia was becoming increasingly isolated in the international community, threatening its larger relationships. </p> <p> The Clinton administration has made ''impressive strides'' in preventing former Soviet scientists from working for rogue states and terrorists seeking unconventional weapons, but it should spend much more to achieve that aim, a Washington research group said yesterday. </p> <p> ''Given the consequences of the chemical and biological brain drain,'' says a report issued by the Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington, ''sound argument can be made for at least doubling the amount of money going annually into collaborative research grants for biological weaponeers, and at a minimum tripling the grant funds for chemical weapons scientists.'' </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin, bristling over President Clinton's criticism of Russia's military assault on Chechnya, complained today that the United States was not treating Russia with the respect due a nuclear power. </p> <p> ''President Clinton permitted himself to put pressure on Russia,'' Mr. Yeltsin said, loudly and deliberately, in front of television cameras after he arrived here today for a day and a half of meetings with Chinese leaders. ''It seems he has for a minute forgotten that Russia has a full arsenal of nuclear weapons.'' </p> <p> Crowning years of negotiations  and, many say, calculated delay -- Russia and Belarus agreed in principle today to form an economic and political confederation modeled roughly after the European Union. </p> <p> But even after a glittering Kremlin ceremony to confirm the accord, and official predictions that the union could lead to a larger and revitalized Slavic compact, it seemed doubtful that Russian leaders would carry out many of the alliance's grand designs soon, if ever. </p> <p> The two espionage cases that are causing so much finger-pointing in Washington are indeed disturbing, but it's also dangerous to read too much into them. </p> <p> The cases of Wen Ho Lee, the nuclear engineer who was indicted on Friday on charges of improperly handling classified information at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Stanislav Grusev, a Russian Embassy employee who was expelled from the United States last week after an electronic bug was discovered at the State Department, raise all sorts of questions about how seriously we take our national security. </p> <p> Russian forces advanced to the outskirts of Grozny today, as the senior Kremlin policy maker on Chechnya predicted that the city would be seized within 10 days. </p> <p> Today's fighting was a fresh indication that the battle for the Chechen capital has entered a decisive phase even as thousands of civilians remained trapped in the city. </p> <p> Russia took the lead today in marshaling a growing opposition to Secretary General Kofi Annan's nomination of a chief arms inspector for Iraq. The opposition suggested protracted battles to come, not only over that appointment, but also over other steps toward resuming the monitoring of Iraqi weapons. </p> <p> France and China joined the Russians in objecting to the nomination of Rolf Ekeus, a Swedish disarmament expert who established the first inspection system in Iraq after the 1991 war in the Persian Gulf, as the executive chairman of a new commission created in December. The three want the nomination process reopened so that someone more acceptable to Iraq can be found. </p> <p> In universities, as in real estate, location and timing are everything. Fortunately for Dr. William Potter, an indefatigable promoter of arms control and American-Russian cooperation, his Center for Nonproliferation Studies has enjoyed both. </p> <p> Established a decade ago as the Soviet Union was disintegrating and control over its vast stores of weapons was slipping into limbo, the center is the only place of study in the United States that offers a graduate certificate in nonproliferation. </p> <p> After four months of war in the north Caucasus, serious doubts have been raised about the Russian military's official death count -- by the media, by experts, by soldiers' families and by Russian soldiers themselves, who have taken to yelling out higher death tolls to reporters visiting sites of recent battles. </p> <p> At this sensitive phase in the latest Chechen war, when popular support is being tested by the letdown that comes from a delayed but still anticipated victory, new voices are joining the usual chorus of skeptics challenging the truth of Moscow's accounts of the war. </p> <p> A senior Russian general today became an unfortunate symbol of the difficulties Russian troops have endured in their campaign to take the Chechen capital, Grozny, when he was reported missing there. </p> <p> Maj. Gen. Mikhail Malofeyev, one of the commanders of the Grozby operation, vanished on Tuesday, the first day of a renewed Russian ground onslaught on the city in the breakaway southern Russian republic. </p> <p> Russian scientists have discovered that weapons-grade plutonium is far more unstable in form than previously suspected, a finding that could have implications for the aging and reliability of America's arsenal of 10,000 or so nuclear warheads. </p> <p> American scientists who recently learned of the Russian discovery say they did so in the course of an exchange program. But such teamwork has been curtailed by recent espionage fears, which American scientists fault as exaggerating the risks of cooperation and ignoring benefits like the plutonium insight. </p> <p> In a sharp departure from its previous assessment of Iran's nuclear capacity, the Central Intelligence Agency has told senior Clinton administration officials that Iran might now be able to make a nuclear weapon, according to several United States officials. </p> <p> George Tenet, director of central intelligence, began briefings in December about the agency's new assessment, shortly after the document was completed, the officials said. The new evaluation has touched off a sharp debate about Iran's nuclear capacity, and the C.I.A.'s ability to monitor it. </p> <p> The new decade arrived well before dawn here today at Peterson Air Force Base, but there was more relief than celebration as the world's 24 time zones began passing from the 20th century without nuclear conflagration. </p> <p> In a collaboration that would have been inconceivable before the cold war ended a decade ago, American and Russian military personnel sat side by side inside an ad hoc Center for Y2K Strategic Stability, where they monitored data that would reflect any ballistic missile activity around the world. </p> <p> As Western governments began spending hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years to help Russia dispose of nuclear weapons and treat radioactive waste, Zvezda seemed like an ideal place to do some of the work. </p> <p> Zvezda is a sprawling military shipyard, so it has the expertise to scrap submarines. The plant sits on the harbor in the town of Bolshoi Kamen on the Sea of Japan, where the Russian Navy had been dumping liquid radioactive waste. And it is in chronic need of cash: its workers, like millions across Russia, are owed months of wages. </p> <p> The Clinton administration said today that it was ''unwise in the extreme'' to allow the government of Saddam Hussein to exercise veto power over United Nations decisions on how to resume arms inspections in Iraq. </p> <p> Criticizing Security Council members who are blocking Secretary General Kofi Annan's appointment of Rolf Ekeus as head of a new disarmament commission for Iraq, the State Department said that the United States stood by Mr. Annan and Mr. Ekeus, an arms control expert who is now Sweden's ambassador in Washington. </p> <p> In the days of Soviet power, the Red Army had political commissars in practically every unit to make sure the soldiers obediently followed the Communist Party line, including atheism. </p> <p> So Father Safrony's presence in the snow-capped mountains of the rebellious southern province of Chechnya still seems a bit unusual. Dressed in a camouflage uniform and black knit cap, the Russian Orthodox priest is the chaplain to the Russian paratroopers who are fighting the Chechen rebels near the Chechen-Dagestani border here. </p> <p> With Russian soldiers dying again in Chechnya, Galya A. is ready to do anything to keep her gangly 18-year-old son, Ruslan, from doing his compulsory two-year military service. </p> <p> If she could, she would bribe her local draft board. But on the paltry $25 pensions she and her disabled husband get each month, it would take them another lifetime to save up the going price, which ranges from $2,000 to $5,000. </p> <p> The citizens of this closed military city, which hides one of Russia's nuclear submarine bases above the Arctic Circle, are staging an extraordinary civic revolt. In a referendum on whether the fleet can put a nuclear waste dump just outside the city limits, they are taking on the navy they have long served. </p> <p> On March 26, Election Day, the people here -- their number an official secret -- will engage in a battle that they feel far more intensely about than the lopsided presidential contest that Acting President Vladimir V. Putin is expected to win. </p> <p> In June 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin came to Washington to celebrate ''partnership and friendship'' with the United States. ''We have left behind the period when America and Russia looked at each other through gun sights,'' he told a joint session of Congress. </p> <p> Nothing better symbolizes the subsequent decline of Russian-American relations than the recent announcement that Russian military strategists had approved use of nuclear weapons ''to repel armed aggression'' -- which some see as a threatening expansion of Russian nuclear doctrines. </p> <p> Although the cold war is over, some arms control analysts say that the threat of a nuclear war is actually greater now. </p> <p> While Russia and the United States continue to reduce their massive strategic nuclear arsenals -- from 4,700 each in 1992 to between 2,000 and 2,500 in 1998 -- the Kremlin's Security Council approved a disturbing shift in military doctrine yesterday that increases Russia's reliance on nuclear weapons. Rather than threatening to use nuclear weapons only ''in case of a threat to the existence of the Russian Federation,'' Russia now says it will use them ''if all other means of resolving the crisis have been exhausted,'' an apparently lower threshold. </p> <p> Three men seized by Russian troops and imprisoned at a detention camp in northern Chechnya this winter have told human rights observers of beatings, torture and rapes they say took place there before they bribed their way to freedom this month. </p> <p> The three, who are now in the neighboring Russian province of Ingushetia, gave their accounts to researchers for Human Rights Watch, which relayed them to news organizations this week. </p> <p> Chechen guerrillas shot down a Russian military helicopter on Friday in mountains near the Argun gorge in southern Chechnya, killing 15 people, Russian officials and Chechen rebels said today. </p> <p> Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo confirmed the loss after a pro-rebel Internet site, www.kavkaz.org, posted a picture of a helicopter, engulfed in flames, lying on its side. Mr. Rushailo said the aircraft fell from about 165 feet into a canyon. </p> <p> Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright came here today to try to convince Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov, whom she has often called her good friend, about the wisdom of a new American missile defense system. </p> <p> At the end of a lengthy session of talks, she conceded she had made little headway. </p> <p> ''No filming the corpses,'' a military press officer barked as a group of correspondents jumped off a Russian Army helicopter on the outskirts of the Chechen capital. </p> <p> Six dead Russian soldiers were wrapped in shiny metal foil and lined up in a muddy field. Some photographer quietly sneaked a shot, but the grisly images were not included in the Russian television news. </p> <p> China's first Russian-built guided-missile destroyer is expected to arrive in the East China Sea as early as this week, enhancing Beijing's ability to threaten American aircraft carriers in any future encounters over Taiwan. </p> <p> Within weeks of the Sovremenny-class destroyer's arrival, Russia is expected to deliver the ship's most formidable weapon, Sunburn antiship missiles specifically designed to penetrate American carrier battle group defenses. The Russian version of the sea-skimming supersonic missile can carry nuclear or conventional warheads. </p> <p> Russia and the United States are in a drawn-out dispute over a powerful American-made radar in Norway that can track missile launchings in western Russia, according to American and Russian officials. </p> <p> The radar began operating last summer as a joint United States-Norwegian intelligence project at Vardo, 40 miles from the Russian border. It has been the subject of talks between Washington and Moscow ever since its assembly began a year and a half ago, officials said. </p> <p> In a major agreement aimed at safeguarding nuclear fuel that could be used to make weapons, Russia has promised to stop making plutonium out of fuel from its civilian power reactors as part of a $100 million joint research and aid package from the United States, Clinton administration and Russian officials say. </p> <p> While the administration has several collaborative programs that enhance the safety and security of plutonium produced by Russia's military, this is the Energy Department's first major attempt to secure Russia's huge civilian stockpile of plutonium, from which 3,000 nuclear weapons could be made. </p> <p> A senior Russian security official who met with President Clinton today appeared to open the door slightly to meeting the administration's desire to deploy a limited national missile defense system. </p> <p> But at the same time, the official, Sergei B. Ivanov, the head of Russia's national security council, said Moscow wanted to keep the essence of the antiballistic missile treaty that the administration is seeking to change. </p> <p> European allies have expressed increasing concerns about the Clinton administration's plans to negotiate with Russia to allow deployment of a missile shield, and about how much the Europeans are being consulted in the matter. </p> <p> Two top British officials visiting here have told the administration that while Britain understands why Washington wants to deploy a limited national missile defense, the administration needs to reassure all members of NATO. Otherwise, the British officials said, there is a danger of a major rift between the United States and its European allies. </p> <p> Roman Sokolov led a group of Russian snipers in Chechnya, and looked the part. He was solidly built, with regular features, close-cropped soldier's hair and threatening V-shaped brows set over eyes fixed in the flat, detached gaze of a career warrior. </p> <p> His face, with its unlined and slightly menacing visage, could easily be a poster in Russia's determined campaign to win Chechnya at any cost. </p> <p> But today the image was in a frame that lay atop Captain Sokolov's zinc coffin in Pskov's soaring Trinity Cathedral. It was a coffin that, like the seven beside it, was covered in carnations and tulips and lilies, bedecked in Russian Orthodox icons and wept over by thousands of mourners. </p> <p> An American double agent working for the F.B.I. provided the Soviet Union with nerve gas data in the 1960's that may have spurred Moscow's own efforts to develop chemical weapons, says a new book on the espionage case. </p> <p> The spy, an Army sergeant, was told by the United States government to hand over the nerve gas information, the book says. </p> <p> Russia hardened its line today against any American attempts to modify a 1972 missile defense treaty and appealed for broad support from other nations, saying the United States was putting three decades of arms agreements in jeopardy. </p> <p> Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov spoke here to representatives of more than 150 nations on the second day of four-week international conference called to assess another treaty, the 1968 pact barring the spread of nuclear weapons. He said Russia is prepared to make deep cuts in its nuclear warheads, but not if the United States plans to construct a missile defense system that would ''destroy'' the 1972 pact, the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. </p> <p> The Security Council quickly approved a streamlined arms inspection commission for Iraq today. But Russia warned that it would be on the lookout for anyone named to the panel who might be troublesome to Iraq. </p> <p> Hans Blix, the new chief inspector and author of the organization plan for the new panel, created by the council in December, said he was pleased with the council endorsement. He is waiting to see what move Iraq makes. </p> <p> Former President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that he disagreed with Russia's new national security doctrine that calls for first use of nuclear weapons in the event of a large- scale attack on Russia by conventional forces, or those employing weapons of mass destruction. </p> <p> A decade after the collapse of Communism appeared to make superpower arms controls routine, the old disputes over missile defenses have suddenly returned to the forefront of United States-Russian relations. And though experts say new rules of the nuclear game are technically feasible, the issue has been caught up in American election politics and Russian suspicions. </p> <p> At issue are the fundamental principles that Washington and Moscow have accepted for almost three decades, that the only way to encourage reductions in strategic arms is to restrict ways to counter them -- an understanding codified in the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. </p> <p> A rebel force  attacked a Russian military convoy on Sunday, Russian officials said today, just days after Aslan Maskhadov, the leader of the secessionist southern Chechnya region, was reported to have ordered guerrilla commanders to suspend combat operations so that peace talks might take hold. </p> <p> The officials said that as many as 15 Russian soldiers were killed. A Chechen rebel spokesman, Movladi Udugov, contended that 80 Russian troops had died and an armored column of 23 tanks and armored vehicles was destroyed in the attack near the village of Serzhen-Yurt, 16 miles from the bombed out regional capital, Grozny. </p> <p> Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright tried today to convince the world that the United States is not threatening to undercut a quarter century of progress on arms control by developing a new antimissile defense system that has drawn criticism from both Russia and China. </p> <p> ''If the Clinton administration were bent on sabotaging the ABM treaty and strategic arms control,'' she told an international arms-control conference, ''we have surely gone about it in a strange way -- in the open, with care and in consultation not only with Congress, but after extensive discussions with our allies and other countries, Russia and China emphatically included.'' </p> <p> Senior Republican senators told President Clinton this week that they opposed his efforts to renegotiate an arms control treaty with Russia and to build only a limited antimissile defense system. </p> <p> The senators -- including the majority leader, Trent Lott, and Jesse Helms -- favor a full, robust defense system against missiles, and many of them prefer to scrap the treaty altogether. They worry that Mr. Clinton will be too willing to compromise in order to conclude a strategic arms agreement with Russia before he leaves office. </p> <p> The Clinton administration has presented Russia with a draft agreement that would revise a key arms control treaty to allow the United States to deploy a limited missile defense system and to hold open the possibility of building a larger system in the future. </p> <p> The proposal would amend the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, long considered a linchpin of arms control, to allow the United States to protect itself against the threat of missile attacks from nations like North Korea, Iraq, Iran and Libya, according to a draft given to the Russians in January. </p> <p> Following are excerpts from the document that American negotiators have presented to the Russians with proposals for amending the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty, in order to allow the United States to build a limited national missile defense system. </p> <p> Topics for Discussion </p> <p> President Clinton is counting on making the decision to deploy the national missile defense (N.M.D.) system no earlier than mid-2000. </p> <p> The U.S. N.M.D. system would not be directed against Russia and would not weaken Russia's strategic deterrence potential. </p> <p> The number of young men who have dodged the draft has soared since fighting broke out in Chechnya, leaving the Russian military without enough new conscripts, a senior general said today. </p> <p> ''The number of draft dodgers increased by almost 50 percent last fall,'' said Col. Gen. Vladislav N. Putilin, the chief of the mobilization department of the Russian General Staff. ''For the first time in four years, the armed forces will experience a shortage of manpower.'' </p> <p> After a second round of intensive meetings with the Russian foreign minister about the missile defense system that the United States wants to develop over Russian objections, senior administration officials said today that they had detected a readiness by Moscow to explore all avenues of a possible resolution to the looming standoff. </p> <p> But they acknowledged that Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov and the chief Russian arms control negotiator, Georgi Memedev, had revealed no significant shift in their opposition to the missile defense plan. ''The Russians have shown a willingness to intensify the process,'' a senior administration official said. ''But we're not seeing a huge shift.'' </p> <p> When the Russian military roared into Chechnya in late September, most people in this factory town in the Urals were convinced that the Kremlin had begun a just and triumphant war. </p> <p> But that was before the bodies arrived, the flags were draped with black ribbons and a local sports complex was turned into a hall of remembrance for 16 policemen killed in an ambush in Chechnya last week. </p> <p> In a foreign policy speech to be delivered on Sunday, Vice President Al Gore gives one of his harshest assessments to date of Gov. George W. Bush, saying his Republican rival is stuck in a cold war time warp, has serious gaps in his experience and knowledge and would rely on isolationist, right-wing advisers for guidance. </p> <p> Mr. Gore faults Mr. Bush for proposing to ''skip'' a generation of military weapons while emphasizing research into more advanced ones, leaving the United States unprepared for battlefields of the next two or three decades, and for wanting to deploy an implausible ''Star Wars'' system. </p> <p> In their battle to scuttle President Clinton's limited national missile defense system, Senate conservatives have a little-noted weapon -- a clause they inserted into another pact leaving it up to senators, and not President Clinton, to decide whether Russia inherited the Soviet role in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. </p> <p> In all other matters, Russia has been treated as the legal successor state to the Soviet Union, taking the Soviet seat on the United Nations Security Council and assuming its responsibilities in other treaties. </p> <p> Speaker J. Dennis Hastert and the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, agreed today to create a national security advisory panel of senior Republican experts in an effort to give more credibility to Congressional scrutiny and criticism of President Clinton's foreign policy. </p> <p> The creation of the panel, which is to be announced next week, coincides with growing alarm and distrust among many Republicans on Capitol Hill over crucial decisions Mr. Clinton will make in the coming weeks on missile defenses, nuclear arms reductions with Russia and other national security issues. </p> <p> American proposals to change a key arms control agreement have revived some of the more important, if arcane, debates over nuclear strategy that not long ago seemed consigned to the dustbin of the cold war. </p> <p> One of those strategies is called ''launch on warning'' and is widely viewed as raising the risk of accidental nuclear war. </p> <p> China's chief arms negotiator said today that the American proposal to build an anti missile defensive shield posed an unacceptable threat to China's security and could force Beijing to significantly expand its own nuclear forces in response. </p> <p> The Chinese find it hard to believe American claims that the proposed ''national missile defense'' is intended only to counter threats from small ''rogue'' states like North Korea, said the official, Sha Zukang, in an interview. But whatever the intention, he said, the systems under discussion would destroy China's ability to deter nuclear attack by neutralizing its relatively small force of nuclear missiles. </p> <p> Declaring that the nation's security no longer required ''a nuclear balance of terror,'' Gov. George W. Bush called today for new -- and possibly unilateral -- reductions in American nuclear weapons coupled with a robust antimissile defense system. </p> <p> Though he shied from specifics, Mr. Bush said he wanted to reduce the size of the United States' nuclear arsenal to the ''lowest possible number consistent with our national security'' and below the levels called for under the Start II accord with Russia. </p> <p> The once top-secret research complex where the Soviet Union perfected dozens of strains of deadly bacteria threw open its doors this week to scientists from around the world. </p> <p> The director of the State Research Center for Applied Microbiology, which is a two-hour drive from Moscow, invited 200 scientists from 10 countries, Western officials and even an American reporter to what was once a crown jewel of the Soviet germ warfare empire, so hidden that it was not listed on Soviet maps. </p> <p> Q: Sajeda and Sehar -- and we should say that we aren't using your real names here, they're the names you use to travel, because of the danger in which your work places you -- you're both members of the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan. Many Americans hear the word ''revolutionary'' and they think ''Communist'' and ''violent.'' Can you tell me about RAWA? </p> <p> SABA: RAWA was founded in 1977 as an organization of women who support women's rights and human rights for both men and women. We opposed the Russian invasion. Today we oppose all the fundamentalists, not just the Taliban. We're for education, health care, equality for women, secular democracy. In Afghanistan, that's revolutionary. </p> <p> One of Russia's leading missile scientists, Yuri P. Savelyev, was always more than willing to teach advanced rocket-building to Iranian engineers, who are said to be working on missiles that could reach most Middle Eastern capitals, and even Alaska. </p> <p> When Russian government officials tried to stop him four years ago because Russia had signed an international agreement to control the spread of ballistic missile technology, Mr. Savelyev persisted. </p> <p> It took decades of international pressure and weeks of intense negotiations, but when a monthlong conference of more than 185 nations ended at the United Nations this weekend, the five original atomic powers had agreed for the first time to the ''unequivocal'' elimination of nuclear arms. </p> <p> Secretary General Kofi Annan called the move, part of a broad agreement to reinvigorate nuclear arms control, ''a significant step forward in humanity's pursuit of a more peaceful world.'' </p> <p> As President Clinton nears a decision on whether to build a limited national missile defense, American intelligence officials are warning that such a system could set off a cold-war-style arms race between China, India and Pakistan, administration officials say. </p> <p> While the American officials have repeatedly said an antimissile defense is not aimed at Beijing, even they acknowledge that the system being designed could significantly undercut or even neutralize China's small nuclear force. </p> <p> The remarkable summit meeting between the Korean leaders this week has left the Clinton administration widely divided over North Korea's intentions, but has not so far diminished its resolve to move ahead with a missile defense, administration and defense officials say. </p> <p> Despite recent diplomatic forays that culminated in a general agreement between the Korean leaders to work for peace and unity on their divided peninsula, North Korea has not stopped work on the long-range missile program that has helped provoke proposals for the United States to build a defensive shield, the officials said. </p> <p> The federal authorities today arrested a former high-ranking civilian employee of the Army on espionage charges and accused him of providing highly classified documents to the Soviet Union over a period of at least 25 years. </p> <p> Prosecutors said the 73-year-old former employee, George Trofimoff, a naturalized American citizen whose parents were Russian emigres, was arrested at a hotel in Tampa, Fla., and charged with passing the documents to a childhood friend, a prominent Russian Orthodox priest who had recruited him for the K.G.B. </p> <p> Administration lawyers have advised President Clinton that, in their view, he could begin building the first piece of a national missile defense system without violating a 1972 arms control treaty with Russia, senior officials said. </p> <p> The lawyers' interpretations, which were drafted at the White House's request, are likely to be rejected by Russia, and the president has not made a decision on them. But they offer Mr. Clinton a way to announce that the United States would go ahead with missile defenses while letting the next administration decide whether to break the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. </p> <p> The Kremlin said today that it has identified remains found in Chechnya this spring as those of Maj. Gen. Gennadi Shpigun, the federal envoy whose kidnapping helped touch off Russia's latest war against the region's secessionist rebels. </p> <p> General Shpigun, an Interior Ministry liaison to Chechen officials, was abducted in March 1999 as his plane was leaving the airport in Grozny, Chechnya's capital. According to news reports, the guerrillas who held him had demanded as much as $15 million in ransom before lowering their price to $3 million late last year. </p> <p> In a effort to broaden their military cooperation, Russia and the United States are planning to conduct a joint exercise of their defenses against short- and medium-range missiles, a senior United States official said today. </p> <p> The aim is to rehearse the procedures for coordinating Russian and American theater missile defenses against a common foe, American officials said. The exercise is likely to take place at Fort Bliss, a United States Army post in Texas, before the end of the year. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia proposed today that his country be placed at the heart of Europe's defenses against missile attack. Mr. Putin warned that an American missile defense system would lead to a ''very dangerous'' arms race. </p> <p> Speaking to several hundred German business leaders in this capital that long stood at the epicenter of the cold war, Mr. Putin sought to portray Russia as a natural ally of Germany and the new Europe, while depicting the United States as insensitive to European concerns. </p> <p> In a triumphant return home from his summit meeting with North Korea, President Kim Dae Jung told jubilant South Koreans today that ''a new day is beginning'' for their divided people. </p> <p> ''When I was in Pyongyang, I realized Pyongyang is our land,'' Mr. Kim said in an address at the airport as he returned from three days of talks with his North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong Il. ''People in Pyongyang are our people. And they have deep-rooted love for their southern compatriots. </p> <p> Arrayed behind George W. Bush as he unveiled his nuclear policy initiative last month were two former secretaries of state, two former national security advisers and a former secretary of defense. </p> <p> But once Mr. Bush and his formidable lineup of older men left the stage, the foreign policy expert who fielded questions on the specifics of the Texas governor's proposal was not Henry A. Kissinger or Colin Powell. It was Condoleezza Rice, a 45-year-old university professor who is tutoring a presidential candidate who concedes that he has much to learn about the world. </p> <p> In its eagerness to persuade Russia to accept deployment of a U.S. missile defense, the Clinton administration has all but ignored China, a nuclear power in its own right and an opponent of these systems. </p> <p> China currently fields about 20 nuclear-armed missiles capable of striking the continental United States. For decades, it has relied on this small force not only to deter a nuclear attack, but also to guarantee it a place at the table with the other great powers and to offset their conventional weaponry. In a conflict, even the limited, 100-interceptor missile defense being pursued by the Clinton administration would be able to counter China's entire strategic nuclear arsenal. </p> <p> Stung by meager defense orders from an impoverished army at home, Russia's military industrial establishment is engaged in a major effort to increase arms sales to Asia, the Middle East and Africa and is expanding its share of the lucrative global arms market. </p> <p> The United States and western Europe dominate the international weapons bazaar. But this week, on a once-secret test range in the Ural mountains, the men who fashioned the formidable arsenal that once made NATO anxious and was paraded with pride by the Kremlin each Nov. 7 showed that they could attract plenty of customers -- and had plenty to sell, too. </p> <p> The state of our political system  the depressing state -- was illuminated by a report in The New York Times last week. The story, by Michael R. Gordon with Steven Lee Myers, showed how petty domestic politics had imposed heavy costs, financial and diplomatic, on plans for a U.S. missile shield. </p> <p> The Clinton administration thought of building the antimissile system at Grand Forks, N.D., where an exception written into the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty allows a U.S. installation. But then computers showed that the single system would not cover the far western end of the Aleutian Islands, with a population of a few thousand. </p> <p> Chechen suicide bombers have set off a series of devastating blasts throughout the breakaway Russian republic, killing at least 37 Russian soldiers and wounding 74, officials said today. </p> <p> In a carefully coordinated rebel attack late Sunday night, five trucks laden with explosives blew up in towns and cities that were ostensibly under Russian control. </p> <p> International arms sales surged last year to nearly $30.3 billion, the highest level since 1996, and the United States solidified its position as the world's biggest arms dealer, according to an authoritative government report. </p> <p> The report by Congressional Research Service, an arm of the Library of Congress, showed that  American contractors sold nearly $11.8 billion in weapons in 1999 -- more than a third of the world's total and more than all European countries combined. </p> <p> Though no one knows just what agonies have befallen the men on the Russian submarine Kursk, other seamen who have been trapped beneath the sea describe how quickly the air can turn toxic and serious physical and emotional deterioration can set in. </p> <p> The classic image of the dangers of submarine warfare has come from movies like ''Das Boot,'' where men huddle quietly together to try to ride out depth-charge attacks and keep their hopes alive. </p> <p> By the late afternoon, most of the major World Wide Web news sites were no longer able to resist the struggle for life unfolding at the bottom of the Barents Sea.  While cable-news channels continued to feature drama-free images from the Democratic National Convention, on the Internet the news from the stricken Russian submarine had taken the lead position on the CBS, MSNBC, Fox News and CNN sites. ''No Signs of Life'' was the Fox site's headline. </p> <p> Of the major network sites, only ABC continued to cling to the convention as its lead item, offering the insight that, yes, now is the time for Vice President Al Gore and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut to introduce themselves to the American people. As John Tyson, one of the vice president's college roommates, described it to MSNBC this evening, the final two days of the convention will provide ''a good strong dose of Al Gore.'' </p> <p> Valentina Staroseltseva thought she was lucky, because her draft-age son could have been sent to fight in Chechnya, the worst nightmare of most Russian mothers. </p> <p> But Dima, 19, won a prestigious spot on the Kursk, the navy's newest and most sophisticated nuclear-powered submarine, named after the southern Russian city the Staroseltsevs are from. </p> <p> The two nuclear reactors in the sunken Russian submarine Kursk should pose no immediate risk to the surrounding environment and only a moderate risk in the coming decades, naval experts and environmentalists say. </p> <p> ''This is not high on the list to worry about,'' said Thomas B. Cochran, director of the nuclear program for the environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council. </p> <p> Russian officials' assertions yesterday that the submarine Kursk sank after a collision, most likely with a foreign submarine, echoed the kind of suspicions that were common during the cold war, when on more than a dozen occasions, Russian and Western submarines banged into one another. </p> <p> The Russians have long resented the fact that many of the collisions occurred in or near their waters and, in their view, amounted to hit-and-run jobs, as American and British spy submarines quickly fled to safety. One Russian submarine was so badly damaged after colliding with an American boat in 1970 that it almost sank, the Russian Navy  contends. </p> <p> The United Nations has assembled a new team of arms inspectors that is ready to enter Iraq within weeks, raising the prospect of another confrontation with President Saddam Hussein over his weapons programs. </p> <p> The creation of the new team comes more than two years after Mr. Hussein halted cooperation with a previous group of inspectors, provoking a diplomatic crisis that culminated in four nights of American and British airstrikes in December 1998. </p> <p> A highly classified intelligence report warns that deploying an American national missile defense could prompt China to expand its nuclear arsenal tenfold and lead Russia to place multiple warheads on ballistic missiles that now carry only one, according to officials who have reviewed it. </p> <p> Although the report reaffirms what China and Russia have publicly said in opposition to the system, it offers a detailed analysis of how those two nations are likely to respond and suggests that the effects of an American decision to build a nuclear defense would ripple around the globe from Europe to South Asia, the officials said. </p> <p> American and Russian officials dedicated a 10-acre industrial park today at what was until recently a nuclear-weapons factory east of Moscow. It was the second step in a joint project that American experts hope will provide jobs for up to 4,000 Russian weapons scientists and workers. </p> <p> Energy Secretary Bill Richardson attended the ceremony, in the once-closed nuclear city of Sarov, several hundred miles east of Moscow. The stop was part of a weeklong sweep through Russia and other former Soviet states in which Mr. Richardson is promoting programs to curb the spread of nuclear materials and technology. </p> <p> With growing evidence of catastrophic damage to the hull of the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk, Russian officials said today that ''irrefutable data'' pointed to a collision. They said the object or ship that collided with the Kursk has not been identified yet. </p> <p> Any vessel that could cause the sort of damage described by the Russian officials would itself have suffered enormous damage, and no such vessel has been reported. </p> <p> Although the tragedy with Russia's Kursk submarine has placed an urgent spotlight on the need for rescue craft, the United States Navy is planning to retire one of its two best undersea rescue vehicles at the end of August in a cost-cutting move that could make it harder to save stricken American submariners, military officials said yesterday. </p> <p> The deep-diving craft are among the vessels that the United States offered to send this week to try to save any Kursk sailors still trapped under 350 feet of arctic water. </p> <p> THE eye-watering fumes of fresh paint waft into the office in a former airport hangar, where Zofia Kargul-Smalewska, president of Gielda C.D., a small exhibitions company, is organizing the annual auto show this summer in this small city in western Poland. She expects 10,000 people to show up for the three-day event, kicking the tires of new and used cars and watching drag races and motorcycle demonstrations on a former Soviet air force base that was decommissioned after the cold war. </p> <p> There is no comparable building in Legnica, said Mrs. Kargul-Smalewska, who has helped turn the base into a makeshift industrial park. ''The Russians have been good for my business,'' she said. </p> <p> The Pentagon and the State Department are sharply divided over how far work on a limited national missile defense system could proceed before the United States would be required to give formal notice that it was violating a crucial arms control treaty with Russia. </p> <p> Officials in the Pentagon and State Department said that disagreement within the administration was a primary reason for Defense Secretary William S. Cohen's delay in making a recommendation to President Clinton this month on the project. </p> <p> The wife of an American who has been in jail here for five months on espionage charges came here today with her congressman to call on the Russian government to let Western doctors examine her husband, who has bone cancer. </p> <p> The woman, Cheri Pope, looked shaken and fatigued after visiting Lefortovo Prison, where her husband, Edmond, a former naval intelligence officer, has been incarcerated since early April. He was arrested for supposedly trying to buy classified plans for a high-technology Russian torpedo system. </p> <p> Six days after something went dreadfully wrong with the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk, another submarine quietly pulled into a Norwegian port, carrying some of the most detailed evidence so far of why the pride of Russia's navy sank to the bottom of the Barents Sea. </p> <p> The other submarine was the Memphis, a nuclear-powered attack submarine based in Groton, Conn., and one of two American submarines that were spying on the largest Russian naval exercise in years when disaster struck the Kursk on the morning of Aug. 12. </p> <p> Battling stormy seas and time, Russian seamen failed twice to hook up a rescue capsule to the nuclear-powered submarine lying broken and powerless on the floor of the Barents Sea with 116 men aboard, officials said early today. </p> <p> With little visibility, the attempts, on Tuesday and early this morning, were unable to dock with the submarine. A piloted capsule was lowered at 8 a.m. today for a third attempt. But with high seas and strong underwater currents, and with the submarine lying at an angle at a depth of 350 to 480 feet, the chances for a rescue seemed to grow dimmer. </p> <p> The Soviet Navy sent a powerful submarine to sea in the late 1980's, determined to strike some fear into the American Navy. </p> <p> But barely before the sub, the Komsomolets, could accomplish anything, a fire burst out underwater. Some crew members escaped after the sub fought its way to the surface of the Norwegian Sea. </p> <p> American officials said today that a warehouse bombed by American and British warplanes on Friday in southern Iraq held antiaircraft weapons and other military equipment, and not supplies of food as the Iraqis claimed. </p> <p> The officials also disputed Iraq's claims that a second attack on Saturday damaged a train station in the same town. In fact, they said, the Americans and British destroyed two antiaircraft batteries half a mile away. </p> <p> The Russian Orthodox Church adopted a social doctrine today that condemns genetic engineering, homosexuality, euthanasia and abortion, approves of the concept of private property and reconfirms the church's close relationship with the military. </p> <p> The doctrine was approved by the approximately 150 hierarchs of the Russian church, who are sitting as the Council of Bishops. On Monday, the council elevated the last czar, Nicholas II, and his family to sainthood, a move that had been sought by conservatives within the church. </p> <p> In putting off a decision on a national missile defense on Friday, President Clinton said the earliest such a shield could be put in place was 2006 or 2007. But the president made a decision on just one system. What he did not say, and what the debate over that system has obscured, is that a number of lesser-known antimissile weapons might be candidates for the same job. </p> <p> They are known as theater missile defense systems, and they are intended to protect American troops and bases in relatively small regions of conflict, much as was attempted during the Persian Gulf war in 1991. But some already under development could be expanded, potentially, to protect larger areas and perhaps even the entire United States, according to experts inside and outside the military. </p> <p> After touring a secret nuclear submarine base on Russia's Pacific coast, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson indicated today that he would support a Kremlin request for help in building a high-security storage site for nuclear fuel from decommissioned Russian subs. </p> <p> Mr. Richardson and other American experts, including Assistant Secretary of Defense Ted Warner, were given broad access to the naval base at Petropavlovsk, on the Kamchatka Peninsula, where roughly 20 submarines already are docked and awaiting dismantling. </p> <p> On Tuesday afternoon, visibly tired after an 11-hour flight from Cairo and still focused on the Middle East, President Clinton met at the White House with two of his closest advisers to hear Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen appeal one last time for making the bold decision to build a national missile defense. </p> <p> Mr. Cohen, speaking forthrightly and matter-of-factly, conceded that technological hurdles remained, and that the Pentagon's schedule for completing a system by 2005 had become no more than a hope. ''Still,'' a senior defense official said, ''he felt we should proceed with construction,'' to give Mr. Clinton's successor a head start. </p> <p> The White House said yesterday that Russia had suspended a contract to sell Iran sophisticated laser technology that Washington says can be used to make fuel for nuclear weapons. But the Russian scientific institute involved says it still plans to make the sale. </p> <p> In an e-mail response yesterday to questions from The New York Times, Boris Yatsenko, director of the Science and Technology Center of Microtechnology, a unit of the government's D. V. Efremov Institute of St. Petersburg, said his institute was planning to sell the equipment, which he said was solely for ''medical, industrial, and scientific purposes.'' </p> <p> The second American submarine in the Barents Sea when the Kursk sank was the Toledo, a Russian news agency reported today. </p> <p> The agency, Interfax, said the Toledo was in the area along with another American submarine, the Memphis, during the Russian naval exercises in mid-August, when the Kursk sank, with the loss of 118 lives. </p> <p> The Pentagon will probably postpone the next test of a national missile defense system until January, administration officials said today. Any decision to deploy the antimissile shield now seems certain to pass out of President Clinton's hands to his successor's. </p> <p> Administration officials had previously said Mr. Clinton would decide this summer on deploying a $60 billion antimissile system that would be ready by 2005. To meet that schedule, the Pentagon has been under heavy pressure for two years to conduct enough flights to show Mr. Clinton and his advisers whether the system was technologically feasible. </p> <p> Now that decisions on deploying a missile defense system will be put off until at least early next year, it's time to deal with a less sweeping but more immediate life-and-death issue: the crumbling of satellites that can prevent accidental launches of Russia's nuclear weapons. </p> <p> For a picture of what these satellites are intended to do, consider a famous near-disaster on the American side in 1979. A training tape simulating a massive Soviet nuclear attack was accidentally run on the computers of the North American Aerospace Defense Command. Everyone thought it was real, and crews prepared to launch American missiles in retaliation. What stopped them were our early-warning satellites, which showed there were no Soviet missiles in the air. </p> <p> As European leaders today applauded President Clinton's decision to defer building a missile defense shield over the United States, Russian officials expressed satisfaction that their diplomatic campaign to galvanize opposition against the American program had apparently helped persuade Mr. Clinton. </p> <p> A former Russian ambassador to the United States, Vladimir P. Lukin, who serves as deputy speaker of the parliament here, called Mr. Clinton's decision predictable and rational and said President Vladimir V. Putin had scored a temporary diplomatic victory. He cautioned, however, that the contentious international issue would return early next year. </p> <p> Zura Uzuyeva was just cleaning up the dishes in the courtyard of her small brick home in the Oktyabrsky district of the Chechen capital last week when the staccato drone of a Russian attack helicopter bathed the neighborhood, the volume rising as it approached. </p> <p> ''My wife had called us to dinner, and we had been sitting at the table, all four of us,'' said her husband, Shamsudin Uzuyev, a former high school principal and teacher of chemistry and biology. ''My sons and I then went inside, and she stayed there in the courtyard to wash. I had hardly opened the door when the missile struck.'' </p> <p> Isolated between two of the world's tallest mountain ranges, the Fergana Valley is the breadbasket of Central Asia. Its tens of thousands of acres of fields, pastures and orchards feed millions of people in the region, and its cotton production is crucial to the economy. </p> <p> Its teeming bazaars, too, are an integral part of the region's history as part of the Silk Road: the markets are exotic rainbows of color and diversity, from the thick felt rugs of onetime mountain nomads to the radiant silk weavings of Marghelan to qurduq fat from sheep and thick sausages made of horse meat. </p> <p> Bowing to a vast popular revolt against him, a pale Slobodan Milosevic resigned tonight as Yugoslavia's president, ending 13 years of rule that have brought his country four wars, international isolation, a NATO bombing campaign and his own indictment on war crimes charges. </p> <p> Vojislav Kostunica, a 56-year-old constitutional lawyer of quiet habits and a firm belief in a future for Yugoslavia as a normal country within Europe, is expected to be inaugurated as president on Saturday. </p> <p> IT was a fortnight so fraught as to seem surreal, a standoff scholars have come to call the most dangerous moment in recorded history. Thirty-eight years ago this autumn, as the United States and the Soviet Union stood on the brink of nuclear conflict over missiles in Cuba, John F. Kennedy and his men groped for a way to avoid the end of the world as they knew it. </p> <p> Those two weeks in October 1962 are among the most analyzed hours in American diplomatic and political history, the subject of reams of scholarly books and articles, memoirs, oral histories and a television docudrama, ''The Missiles of October'' (1974). Many of the deliberations among the president and his advisers were recorded verbatim. So recapturing the taste and feel and rhythms of that time in a way that seems both faithful and fresh is no easy effort. But that is the task that ''Thirteen Days,'' a big-budget Hollywood film opening Dec. 20, sets for itself. </p> <p> Russia's deputy prime minister said tonight that divers investigating the cause of the explosion that sank the Russian submarine Kursk in August had found ''serious visual evidence'' pointing to a collision between the submarine and another object. </p> <p> But the deputy prime minister, Ilya Klebanov, said an investigative panel had still not ruled out other possible causes of the disaster, which killed 118 sailors. And he offered no opinion as to what the huge submarine might have struck, if indeed a collision occurred. </p> <p> Kevin Costner is suitably flinty in ''13 Days,'' a competent, by-the-numbers recreation of the events surrounding the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. This is an attempted man's man drama, a void that needs to be filled since Mel Gibson is wearing pantyhose this season. </p> <p> Mr. Costner is Kenny O'Donnell, the right hand of John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) and his brother Robert (Steven Culp), and he is so close by the Kennedys' side that you half expect him to trip over the many biographers who must have been been lurking around the White House like ninjas. </p> <p> Edmond Pope's military service, as described today by the Navy, shows a career in military intelligence that would have given him marketable skills in the private sector -- but would also have drawn the attention of Russian security services. </p> <p> The Navy fact sheet listed tours with the chief of naval operations, the Naval Intelligence Command and the Defense Intelligence Agency. He spent nearly three decades in the Navy before retiring as a captain in 1994. </p> <p> As the spy trial of a former American naval intelligence officer nears its end here, American and Russian experts say the technology that he was trying to acquire, a rocket-propelled torpedo that travels 230 miles an hour underwater, represented a significant advance in submarine warfare. No similar weapon exists in Western navies, the experts said. </p> <p> The legal battle at the closed trial of former officer, Edmond Pope, which began on Oct. 18 under protest from the United States, appears to turn on whether the technical reports at issue were classified. Mr. Pope was arrested along with a professor at Bauman State Technical University, Anatoly Babkin, and has been held in a cell here. </p> <p> Film critics describe ''Thirteen Days,'' the new historical drama based on the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, as a ''by-the-numbers recreation'' and ''close to perfect.'' Print advertisements for the movie, though, are not as precise. </p> <p> New Line Cinema, which is distributing the film that stars Kevin Costner as a senior aide to John F. Kennedy when the United States and Soviet Union came close to nuclear war, is removing from circulation a two-page advertisement that ran today in some newspapers across the nation, including The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times. </p> <p> China and Russia are working on a treaty proclaiming friendship, the strongest sign yet of their shared unhappiness with the supremacy of the United States and its plans to build a shield against ballistic missiles. </p> <p> There is no sign that China and Russia plan to enter a genuine alliance, with mutual pledges of aid in time of war, say Chinese and Western scholars and diplomats. </p> <p> A Russian-American disarmament agreement to take 68 tons of plutonium out of nuclear weapons could have the unintended effect of increasing the  chance of nuclear proliferation, according to a report by an independent researcher. </p> <p> The researcher, Arjun Makhijani, a nuclear physicist who has specialized in analyzing Energy Department weapons activities, also found that efforts around the world to make plutonium and use it as reactor fuel have cost about $100 billion, and make little economic sense. </p> <p> Senior NATO generals, United Nations officials and Western diplomats say they believe that the American role in Kosovo is as crucial now as ever, and they assert that President-elect George W. Bush's expressed desire to pull American troops out of the Balkans is both ill-timed and damaging to Western goals in the region. </p> <p> American troops perform more than a military function, they emphasize, and their presence alone serves as the best deterrent not only to Serbia, but also to ethnic extremists on both sides in a period of major political change. </p> <p> I too have had a White House  sleepover  in the bomb shelter. I was reminded of that night by ''13 Days,'' the new film about the events surrounding the Cuban missile crisis in October, 1962. During the crisis, I was an aide, one of nine people working in the Kennedy White House press office. </p> <p> I first realized something portentous was going on when, on a presidential trip to Chicago, we abruptly returned to Washington. There were rumbles about the real reason for our change in travel plans, which had been attributed to Mr. Kennedy's having a cold. None of us in the press office were privy to the fact that five days earlier, aerial reconnaissance photographs had revealed Soviet missiles in Cuba. It was not until our preparations for the president's address to the American people a day or two later that lower-eschelon staff people like myself began to recognize the high-wire act the president was engaged in. </p> <p> Taiwan has signaled that it may ask the Bush administration to sell it four Kidd-class guided-missile destroyers to counter China's recently purchased Russian-made destroyers, the second of which is now steaming toward the Taiwan Strait. </p> <p> The request, likely to be made before the United States and Taiwan hold annual talks on arms sales in April, would present George W. Bush with his first major challenge in managing the delicate balance of relations between China and Taiwan. </p> <p> When President Eduard A. Shevardnadze of Georgia had to send his energy minister to Moscow last week to beg for a resumption of natural gas to keep the heat and lights on in Tbilisi, shivers went through the corridors of capitals across the Caucasus. </p> <p> Russia's willingness to cut off vital gas supplies to Georgia is seen in the region as a message that Moscow is determined to use its extensive gas and oil supplies as leverage to rebuild its dominant Soviet-era role. </p> <p> Colin Powell's State Department, nibbling its nails about anti-globalist protests, warned Americans about traveling to the World Economic Forum in dangerous Davos, where the elite meet to not compete. But intrepid opinionmongers trekked into these Alps to learn how Chinese and Russian leaders react to Bush administration plans for a missile defense. </p> <p> Internal political paranoia in Beijing inclines its leaders to make a deal. Lee Kuan Yew, dictator of Singapore, recently cracked down on Falun Gong adherents who were stretching and breathing deeply in a public park without a permit. That showed the believers who was boss in the shopping-mall nation, but unlike the insecure dictators in China, Lee did not imprison, torture or murder them. </p> <p> Russian sales to Iran of technology that has both civilian and military purposes are a major obstacle to expanding American efforts to prevent the spread of Russian nuclear material, a bipartisan panel has found. </p> <p> The panel, established by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to review Energy Department programs intended to safeguard Russian nuclear material, has found that the trade in so called dual-use technology, as well as in conventional weapons, from Russia to Iran remained a critical problem in relations between Washington and Moscow. And that problem makes it more difficult to resolve related proliferation disputes. </p> <p> Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, the first senior Bush administration official to visit Europe, tried today to defuse opposition to the administration's antimissile plans by offering to help European nations and other allies to deploy missile defenses. </p> <p> But while Mr. Rumsfeld assured European allies that the United States would consult with them on its antimissile plan, he did not address in any detail one of the Europeans' principal concerns: how an antimissile defense can be reconciled with strategic arms control and a productive relationship with Moscow. </p> <p> After months of protesting the American plan to develop an antimissile system, Russia has begun to talk more seriously about the possibility of missile defenses. </p> <p> The Russians are still deeply unhappy about the Bush administration's decision to build a missile shield. Moscow's ideas on how to develop a missile defense are also sketchy and a far cry from the more ambitious system that the United States is most likely to design. </p> <p> ''Sorry about the handwriting,'' my linguistic source at the Allenwood Federal Penitentiary in White Deer, Pa., writes. ''The Bureau of Prisons has a dinosaurian paranoia about typewriters, word processors and just about any writing tools beyond pencils and ballpoints, universally called 'ink pins.' '' </p> <p> My correspondent is Aldrich Ames, the American who spent nine years as a mole inside the C.I.A., paid by the Soviet Union to finger our spies in the Kremlin. His espionage  led to the execution of a dozen U.S. sources. </p> <p> A Russian intelligence source warned the United States in the mid-1990's that Moscow had a spy inside the Federal Bureau of Investigation, but investigators were unable to track the lead to Robert Philip Hanssen, the F.B.I. agent who was arrested on Feb. 18 on espionage charges, intelligence and law enforcement officials said today. </p> <p> The tip from the Russian official prompted the F.B.I. to briefly begin a counterintelligence inquiry within its own ranks, officials said. But the investigation was abandoned after the same Russian source returned, several months later, and told the Americans that Moscow's agent was in the Central Intelligence Agency, not the F.B.I. </p> <p> Leaders of the new government in Serbia suggested today that the arrest of the former secret police chief this weekend would inevitably lead investigators to Slobodan Milosevic, who is widely blamed for instigating the Balkan wars of the last decade and is seen by Serbs as the cause of their isolation and impoverishment. </p> <p> Mr. Milosevic, who was forced out as president of Yugoslavia in October, has been indicted by the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague for atrocities apparently committed by security forces in the 1999 Kosovo war; Serbs say he should also stand trial in Serbia for misdeeds ranging from electoral fraud to vast corruption. </p> <p> Russian military officials promised today to investigate a grave containing a number of bodies found near a Russian military base outside the Chechen capital, Grozny. But they made it clear that they believed that its inhabitants had been killed by Chechen rebels and not by Russian soldiers. </p> <p> A rebel spokesman denied that, and contended that the grave contained the bodies of Chechen civilians who had been rounded up by Russian troops in local mopping-up operations, never to be seen again. </p> <p> The Russians apparently never knew the name of their prized American spy. </p> <p> To them, he was only B or Ramon or R. Garcia, the code names that the hypercautious American used during the 15 years that he is said to have provided Moscow with some of the most sensitive intelligence documents in the files of the F.B.I. </p> <p> When a Central Intelligence Agency officer, Aldrich H. Ames, was arrested as a spy for Moscow in 1994, critics questioned how the agency could have allowed his espionage to go undetected for nine years. Officials at the Federal Bureau of Investigation helped fuel the criticism with complaints that the C.I.A. had failed to share sensitive information, stifling the investigation. </p> <p> Now the F.B.I. finds the shoe on the other foot, facing questions about how it allowed a senior bureau official to spy for Moscow for nearly twice as long as Mr. Ames had. </p> <p> A senior F.B.I. agent who worked as a counterintelligence supervisor at the agency's headquarters was charged today as a spy who passed highly classified information to Russia for 15 years without being detected. Law enforcement officials described the case as an extremely grave breach of national security. </p> <p> The agent, Robert Philip Hanssen, 56, was accused of turning over to Moscow a huge array of secrets, including the identities of three Russian agents who had been secretly recruited to spy for the United States. Two of the Russians were subsequently tried and executed; the third was imprisoned and later released. </p> <p> Following is a transcript of President Bush's news conference yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times: </p> <p> MR. BUSH </p> <p> Good afternoon. It's been about a month now since I've taken office. And I thought it appropriate to come by and have a press conference. </p> <p> For nearly a dozen years, a former State Department official, Felix S. Bloch, has lived in limbo, dismissed from his senior diplomatic post and investigated on suspicion of being a Russian spy, yet never charged with any crime. </p> <p> While United States intelligence and law enforcement officials have long made it clear that they harbored strong suspicions that Mr. Bloch had committed espionage, the government never took its case to court. Former United States officials have complained that their 1989 inquiry was short-circuited -- and their ability to gather evidence limited -- because Mr. Bloch had somehow been warned that he was under scrutiny. </p> <p> For a number of years, American intelligence officials have had evidence that Russia had a significant pipeline from the United States government, yet the F.B.I. failed to conduct a rigorous internal review of its own personnel, current and former government officials say. </p> <p> The conclusion that Moscow had somehow penetrated the American government -- perhaps with a well-placed mole or some other intelligence technique -- was drawn by these officials from older threads of evidence in a series of seemingly unrelated breakdowns. Those included the collapse of the 1989 espionage investigation of Felix S. Bloch, a State Department employee, as well as the unexplained failures of technical intelligence operations aimed at the Russians. </p> <p> Boris Yuzhin could be called the third man in the unfolding F.B.I. spy drama, the only survivor of a trio of named Russian agents for the United States who the government says were exposed by Robert Philip Hanssen. </p> <p> On Monday, the day before the espionage scandal broke, Mr. Yuzhin received a cryptic call at his home in Northern California.  ''Watch the news tomorrow,'' an F.B.I. contact said. </p> <p> There is nothing more painful for the men and women entrusted with the security of our country than learning that one of their own has betrayed them and their country. No part of our government is immune to such treachery, no matter how thorough an organization's security and vetting procedures. </p> <p> The arrest for espionage of Robert Philip Hanssen, a longtime counterintelligence officer at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, has prompted many questions. Above all, how could the spying attributed to him continue for 15 years without detection? </p> <p> A little phrase from Rudolf Scharping, the German defense minister, recently caused American military commanders to shudder: ''As the European Union develops its security and defense policy and becomes an independent actor, we must determine our security policy with Russia, our biggest neighbor.'' </p> <p> The specter of Europe -- and particularly its central power, Germany -- adopting a more independent stance from NATO and paying close heed to Russia is chilling for the United States, and hard to reconcile with the Atlantic alliance that has preserved Europe's stability and advanced American interests for more than a half-century. </p> <p> Russia's foreign minister said today in Geneva that his country and the United States should undertake an ''active and meaningful'' dialogue as soon as possible to develop defenses against ballistic missiles in troubled parts of the world. </p> <p> But the minister, Igor S. Ivanov, reiterated Moscow's opposition to any plan to erect a national missile defense over the United States in violation of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. </p> <p> Russia is using international trade in weapons and technology to improve relations with China, India and Iran while trying to revive its status as a great power and challenge United States influence, the director of central intelligence, George J. Tenet, said today. </p> <p> In blunt testimony to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Mr. Tenet indicated that the United States intelligence community was increasingly concerned by the direction of Moscow's foreign policy under President Vladimir V. Putin. </p> <p> Though its drive to build a national missile defense is barely under way, the Bush administration has already managed to shift the focus of the European security debate. </p> <p> Despite deep-seated hopes that the missile defense issue would just go away, European officials now seem to accept, grudgingly, the fact that the new American team is determined to move ahead. </p> <p> Marie Vikova, huddling with her daughter and her dog against a biting wind under the massive plinth where one of the world's largest statues of Stalin used to stand, pondered the city's latest idea for what to do with this echoing, haunted place: an aquarium, for tourists. </p> <p> ''Well, one shark for another,'' Mrs. Vikova said. ''At least these can't hurt anyone.'' </p> <p> With the conflict intensifying in Macedonia, the Bush administration and European allies made plain today that they had no interest in using NATO-led peacekeepers to fight Albanian insurgents and that the problem was one for Macedonia's government to resolve with diplomatic and monetary aid. </p> <p> The fighting around Macedonia's second-largest city, Tetovo, entered its fifth day today and has already sent hundreds of residents fleeing.  Macedonian troops are using heavy mortars to battle ethnic Albanian rebels in the hills above the city, and  reports said the government had called for the mobilization of reserves, a curfew and restrictions on civilian movements. </p> <p> As President Bush prepares this week for his first meeting with a senior Chinese official, his administration faces two decisions on military issues that could quickly put the United States on a collision course with Beijing. </p> <p> The issues are whether to design a  national missile defense capable of countering China's small nuclear force and whether to sell destroyers equipped with the Aegis radar system to Taiwan. </p> <p> Vladimir Frolov, the press attaché in the Russian Embassy here, abruptly left for Moscow last week, his second tour of duty in the United States unexpectedly cut short. </p> <p> Mr. Frolov, who built a reputation among American journalists and experts at Washington policy organizations as a reliable and candid observer of United States-Russian relations, told reporters that he was returning home to join the Russian newspaper Izvestia. </p> <p> Russia today accused two senior officials of the Bush administration of making ''openly confrontational'' statements by labeling Moscow as an ''active proliferator'' of dangerous weapons technologies. </p> <p> The Russian Foreign Ministry issued its strongly worded response to an interview published in Britain's Sunday Telegraph in which Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and his deputy, Paul D. Wolfowitz, used the most trenchant language to date among senior Bush aides to complain of Russia's role in providing ballistic missile technology to Iran and other nations. </p> <p> An editorial this weekend in the Süddeutsche Zeitung, a leading paper, had a brisk headline in English: ''Bully Bush.'' It reflected a growing allied concern over the direction of the Bush administration's foreign policy that the Europeans seem determined to resist. </p> <p> The editorial characterized the expulsions of about 50 Russian diplomats as ''extreme measures,'' criticized President Bush's handling of the Middle East, and fretted over his policy toward China and Taiwan. ''The strongest in the class should refrain from beating up his weaker classmates,'' the paper commented. </p> <p> Just three days after Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Cracow became Pope John Paul II in 1978, the Central Intelligence Agency predicted that the installation of the first Polish pontiff would lead to political instability within Poland and the erosion of the Soviet Union's ability to control its Eastern European empire, according to newly declassified C.I.A. documents. </p> <p> In the analysis, in October 1978, the C.I.A. forecast that Moscow would find it increasingly difficult to ''check and to counter Poland's instinctive, cultural and political gravitation to the West.'' In fact, the Solidarity movement, a Polish workers' rebellion against Communist rule that was supported by the pope, began just two years later, and ultimately played a crucial role in ending Soviet control over Eastern Europe. </p> <p> Indulging its own version of spy mania, Russia's intelligence services released television film on the main news channels tonight showing United States military attachés buying information from a Russian agent. </p> <p> The news programs also broadcast an audio tape of a Russian scholar, currently on trial for espionage, phoning Capt. Robert Brannon, a senior American naval attaché here, and discussing what kind of armaments were aboard a Russian intelligence ship sent to the Balkans during the NATO military campaign in 1999. </p> <p> In a retaliatory move, the Bush administration has ordered a number of Russian diplomats to leave the country in the wake of the arrest last month of an F.B.I. agent on charges that he spied for Moscow for more than 15 years, American officials said today. </p> <p> Secretary of State Colin L. Powell met with the Russian ambassador, Yuri V. Ushakov, this afternoon and issued the order that the diplomats leave, the officials said, describing them as intelligence officers working undercover as diplomats. </p> <p> Pay attention to the brouhaha at the White House Wednesday, when President Bush shot down the hopes of President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea that the Bush team would quickly resume negotiations with North Korea. This episode highlights the fine line between a tough, effective foreign policy and a tough, ineffective foreign policy, and it raises the question: On which side of that line does Mr. Bush plan to reside? </p> <p> On Tuesday, Secretary of State Colin Powell, who represents the pragmatic, hard-nosed internationalists within the administration, declared that the Bush team intended  ''to pick up where President Clinton and his administration left off'' in negotiations with North Korea to curb its production and sale of ballistic missiles. But President Bush, after meeting President Kim Wednesday, brusquely indicated that the missile talks with the North would not be resumed any time soon. </p> <p> For half a decade, Russia has conducted what it says are nonnuclear tests under the ground of an Arctic island, as the United States says it does beneath the Nevada desert. </p> <p> But the tests have caused bitter divisions among intelligence officials and nuclear analysts in Washington. Some have concluded that Russia is lying and is instead detonating small nuclear blasts; other experts say that charge is reckless and probably wrong. </p> <p> The United States government constructed a secret tunnel under the Soviet Union's embassy in Washington to eavesdrop, but federal investigators now believe the operation was betrayed by the F.B.I. agent who was arrested last month on charges of spying for Moscow, current and former United States intelligence and law enforcement officials say. </p> <p> The secret tunnel operation, which officials indicated was run jointly by the F.B.I. and the National Security Agency, was part of a broad United States effort to eavesdrop on and track Soviet -- later Russian -- facilities and personnel operating in the United States. </p> <p> Before visiting Washington early this month for his first meeting with President Bush, the South Korean president, Kim Dae Jung, was bubbling with ideas about how to sustain the momentum in his quest to reconcile his nation with its long-hostile neighbor, North Korea. </p> <p> There was talk of signing a joint peace declaration with the North, formally ending hostilities decades after the end of their civil war. South Korea was considering supplying electricity to its energy-poor neighbor. And there were expectations of a return visit to Seoul this spring by the North's leader, Kim Jong Il, following up on a summit meeting last June in Pyongyang. </p> <p> The F.B.I. will give lie-detector tests to about 500 employees with access to intelligence information starting next week, the first new security step in the wake of the arrest of Robert P. Hanssen, the F.B.I. agent accused of spying for Russia, an agency spokesman said today. </p> <p> Among the employees who will face the first polygraph exams of their careers are about 150 top managers at F.B.I. headquarters here, as well as special agents in charge of regional offices. </p> <p> The wood-paneled auditorium, filled with more than 175 gray-haired men in gray suits, was buzzing. The men, mostly retired C.I.A. analysts and some current ones, were not known for their garrulousness, but many couldn't contain themselves. ''This is all too much,'' said an otherwise sober-minded analyst. ''I'm sorry. I just -- I can't stop talking. This is great!'' </p> <p> They had gathered at Princeton University last week along with 70-some professors, students and dabblers in espionage for a two-day conference devoted to the agency's analysis of the Soviet Union from 1947 to 1991. </p> <p> Two competing foreign policy camps are emerging in the Bush administration -- an ideologically conservative Pentagon and a more moderate State Department -- which have already provided President Bush conflicting advice on central issues. </p> <p> At the Pentagon, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld is collecting a hard-line group of advisers who have supported arming the Iraqi opposition to overthrow President Saddam Hussein and who are deeply skeptical of the European effort to form a rapid deployment force alongside NATO. </p> <p> For all the reminders of Bob Key's cold war effort, mining uranium for American nuclear weapons programs, none stands out more than the tank of oxygen tethered to his throat. Mr. Key, 61, has pulmonary fibrosis, a scarring of the lungs that is often fatal. A recent tracheotomy helps air flow to his lungs through a tube connected to the tank. </p> <p> A decade ago, Congress recognized the contributions of Mr. Key and other uranium miners and passed the Radiation Exposure and Compensation Act of 1990. Signed by President George Bush, the law established one-time payments of up to $100,000 to miners or their families and to people who lived downwind from the nuclear test sites in Nevada. Last year, Congress increased the payout to $150,000, added new medical benefits and expanded the number of workers eligible. </p> <p> China's top arms-control negotiator, reiterating the country's opposition to American development of a national missile-defense system or a smaller ''theater'' system in Asia, said today that China was willing to discuss the proposed antimissile shields with the United States in order to ''narrow our differences.'' </p> <p> Sha Zukang, director of China's Arms Control and Disarmament Department, called the national missile-defense plan an American attempt ''to seek its own absolute security'' at the expense of other countries. He also said the presence in Asia of a smaller shield would hurt stability in the region. </p> <p> The Bush administration took a muted public approach today to Russia's decision to resume sales of conventional arms to Iran, using the arrival of Moscow's senior national security official to express concerns that fell short of sharp criticism. </p> <p> Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said that the United States had to be ''candid with the Russians'' in telling them that they should not be ''investing in weapons sales in countries such as Iran which have no future.'' </p> <p> Wendy R. Sherman brought along an extra suitcase of cold-weather gear even when she joined Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright for a December trip through Africa. </p> <p> As the Clinton administration's senior policy coordinator on North Korea, Ms. Sherman was prepared to fly to Pyongyang on a moment's notice. Her task there would be to clear away the final barriers to an accord that would neutralize the North Korean missile threat, which has been a central justification for the hotly debated American national missile defense project. Had she succeeded, the framework of an agreement would have been signed by  President Clinton and Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, in Pyongyang, the North's capital. </p> <p> The Federal Security Service said today that it had no further interest in an American student arrested on drug charges this month, who it said on Tuesday was training to become an American military spy. </p> <p> But other officials indicated that they might charge the American with more serious violations of narcotics law that could lead to a lengthy prison sentence. </p> <p> It was late last March 26 that a Russian Army colonel, Yuri D. Budanov, and three soldiers left an encampment outside Chechnya's capital, Grozny, and pointed their armored personnel carrier south into the village of Tangi, then east on to a lane. </p> <p> At the first house on that road -- No. 7, three rooms of plaster and brick belonging to Vissa Kungayev -- the four stopped. They broke out AK-47's, entered, seized 18-year-old Elza Kungayeva, and bound her in a blanket. Then they took her to Colonel Budanov's quarters. </p> <p> WHEN he was the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, William H. Webster figured that if he was going to demand that other people take lie-detector tests, he had better take one himself. ''I wanted to know how I would feel,'' he said. </p> <p> So he allowed the bureau's polygraph specialists to hook him up to one of the machines, which measured his blood pressure and pulse rate, and he remembered with a slight cringe that he suddenly found himself recalling some of the embarrassing moments of his life. </p> <p> A senior Chinese Army officer defected while visiting the United States in December, American officials said today. The officer reportedly specializes in American issues and is an expert on disarmament for the Chinese general staff. </p> <p> The officer, Xu Junping, a senior colonel in the Chinese People's Liberation Army, defected while in New York, officials said. </p> <p> Much of the coverage of the demise of the Mir space station was misty-eyed and nostalgic. Commentators used Mir's fiery descent as a metaphor for Russia's fall. </p> <p> This lamentation is misguided. Instead, we should say ''Good riddance!'' The station's decommissioning is a sign not of Russia's decline, but of her liberation. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin is deep in the Siberian taiga -- either skiing or hunting wolves, the Kremlin will not say for sure -- but here in the capital there is no vacation from the political debate that Russia's blossoming relationship with Iran has touched off. </p> <p> A state visit this week by the Iranian president, Mohammad Khatami, the first of its kind since the Iranian revolution, has not only set off alarms in the Bush administration over Moscow's determination to sell arms and nuclear technology to Tehran. It has also caused prominent Russians to question the prudence of developing warmer relations with a country believed to be supporting terrorism. </p> <p> Robert Philip Hanssen, the F.B.I. agent arrested last month on charges of spying for Moscow, carried a current statement for a Swiss bank account in his briefcase on the day of his arrest, prosecutors said in court papers filed today. </p> <p> The prosecutors, arguing that Mr. Hanssen should not be released on bail, said that the bank account was maintained at Credit Suisse in Zurich and that the statement was found in his briefcase at his home along with a valid passport and other financial documents, suggesting that he was ready to flee on short notice. </p> <p> President Bush's announcement in his first address to Congress that it is time to ''discard cold war relics and reduce our own nuclear forces to reflect today's needs'' is an important step in the right direction. </p> <p> The risk of a nuclear attack still poses the greatest single threat to our survival. Implementing steep cuts in global nuclear arms is essential to our national interest. But since 1991, when the treaty known as Start I was signed, reductions in Washington's and Moscow's arsenals of nuclear weapons have been stalled by a Democratic president who was afraid of the political consequences of ''unilateral'' reductions and a Republican Congress that changed federal law to prevent the president from going below Start I levels. </p> <p> The Russian-language voice-over on an audio tape provided by Russia's domestic intelligence service and broadcast on state television contained information involving allegations of espionage that did not exist on the actual recording. </p> <p> In its effort to prove that American military attachés here have engaged in espionage, the Federal Security Service (known by its Russian initials F.S.B.) released an audio tape purporting to show that a Russian scholar accused of spying gave an American naval officer here information about the armaments on a Russian intelligence ship, the Liman. </p> <p> The Russian government today denounced the expulsion of about 50 of its diplomats from the United States as a ''hostile'' act and vowed an ''adequate'' retaliation. ''You will not have to wait long,'' Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov warned in a statement to an American television network. </p> <p> Mr. Ivanov did not elaborate, but other Russian officials made clear that Americans would be expelled from Russia. ''We have time to think, to carefully pick from among more than 1,000 U.S. diplomats in Russia, to choose those 46 who are most precious to the Americans,'' Sergei B. Ivanov, the chief of Russia's Security Council, said on Polish state television during a visit to Warsaw. </p> <p> Retaliatory measures now under way between Washington and Moscow fit neatly into the long-established rules of the espionage game that the two sides have played by ever since their first spies went out into the cold to do silent battle. </p> <p> President Bush's decision to expel four Russian diplomats immediately, and demand that the Russians withdraw 46 more by July 1, is the largest such action since 1986 and far more aggressive than any similar move taken by the United States since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Russian officials, complaining that the Bush administration is trying to return to a cold war mentality, vowed to retaliate in kind. </p> <p> A little more than a decade ago, George W. Bush's father played a decisive role in uniting Germany. On Thursday, the president will come face to face with the consequences of that act as he meets a buoyant German chancellor carrying firm, sometimes confrontational, messages from Europe. </p> <p> Gone is the Germany that existed during the cold war, sovereign in name but rather less so in reality.  Gone is the Germany that knew its interests but seldom dared speak them aloud. In their place is a more confident, assertive nation whose new ambitions Chancellor Gerhard Schröder has come to embody. </p> <p> The White House is starting a comprehensive review of all American aid programs to Russia set up to stop the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, a senior administration official said yesterday. </p> <p> The broad review, initiated by National Security Council officials who have previously been critical of some of these programs, is likely to change significantly how Washington spends more than $760 million a year trying to dismantle former Soviet nuclear, biological and chemical complexes and prevent unconventional weapons and hazardous materials from being either sold to rogue states and terrorist groups or stolen by them. </p> <p> The Pentagon today produced a grainy videotape of a close encounter between a Chinese fighter jet and an American spy plane that it said underscored a pattern of aggressive and reckless flying by China's Air Force in recent months. </p> <p> The black and white videotape taken on Jan. 24 showed a Chinese F-8 -- based on its number, the same jet lost in a collision on April 1 with an American spy plane -- darting in front of another American EP-3E Aries II reconnaissance aircraft. ''We got thumped!'' an American is heard saying as the wash of the jet's engine rocked the aircraft. </p> <p> For more than 50 years, the EP-3E and similar spy planes have made tens of thousands of flights off the coasts of Russia, China and North Korea and in the Middle East, gathering intelligence. </p> <p> The EP-3E that was damaged in a collision with a Chinese fighter jet on April 1 is still in China, and as diplomats discuss its fate, the issue arises whether this facet of the spy game has outlived its usefulness. </p> <p> Two years before the arrest of a veteran F.B.I. agent accused of spying for Russia, a senior investigator at the Federal Bureau of Investigation concluded in a still-classified report that Moscow might have recruited a mole in the bureau's ranks, current and former bureau officials say. </p> <p> In early 1999, F.B.I. Director Louis Freeh was told by Thomas Kimmel, the investigator, about his findings. In response, the officials said, senior bureau officials convinced Mr. Freeh that Mr. Kimmel's reasoning was flawed and investigators focused their hunt for a mole at the Central Intelligence Agency, not the bureau. </p> <p> The collision between a Chinese fighter and an United States Navy intelligence plane over the weekend was more than a random accident. It also reflected an increasingly dangerous rivalry between the Chinese and American militaries. </p> <p> After decades of keeping watch over its own skies, China's Air Force has begun in recent years to range farther out above the waters beyond its borders. The United States, in turn, has expanded its intelligence-gathering in the region, as Washington's security interests have increasingly turned eastward and away from the cold war theaters of Europe and the Soviet Union. </p> <p> Across Europe, the standoff between the United States and China is being seen as a serious international crisis and a test of President Bush's young administration. </p> <p> Reports of the collision between an American spy plane and a Chinese fighter plane were front page news just about everywhere and prompted dozens of editorials, most of them urging China to return the American aircraft and its 24-member crew. </p> <p> So, Cornelius Bull asked the high school senior sunk into his sofa, ''you want to go build a boat in Russia?'' </p> <p> ''You want to work in a family circus in California and be a juggler?'' Mr. Bull continued, flashing a dot of red light on the map of the world behind his desk. ''Alaska? Want to go work with some sled dogs? Would you like to be fluent in Spanish? You want to build a guitar? In England? For three months?'' </p> <p> As President Bush nears a decision on which arms to provide to Taiwan, China is warning that a sale of advanced weapons would endanger relations that have already been strained by the spy-plane collision. </p> <p> ''Arms sales to Taiwan are the biggest issue in our relations with the U.S.,'' Sha Zukang, the senior official in charge of arms control for the Foreign Ministry, said in an interview this week. ''If the United States does not behave well, it may destroy our relations.'' </p> <p> The international organization charged with verifying the 1997 treaty that bans chemical weapons is in debt and may be forced to cut inspections in half this year because the United States and other key parties to the treaty have not paid their way, arms control experts said Wednesday. </p> <p> Ron G. Manley, director of verification for the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which is charged with implementing the treaty and ridding the world of chemical weapons, said in an interview that the United States, Russia and other member states were largely responsible for the financial crunch by failing to pay their annual assessments on time and failing to reimburse the group for inspections and other activities. </p> <p> I would never do this myself, but if one wanted to be nasty, one could write a column with the following lead: </p> <p> ''China says it wants an apology for the collision of the U.S. surveillance plane with a Chinese fighter jet, which resulted in the death of a Chinese pilot. Well, I say the Chinese are right. We should apologize. But why stop with the plane incident? We should apologize for being the market for $40 billion a year of China's exports. We should apologize for the fact that U.S. companies are among the largest foreign investors in China and have been instrumental in China's economic takeoff. We should apologize for the fact that 54,000 Chinese students study in the U.S. every year, more than any other nationality. We should apologize for the fact that the U.S. has shown restraint in weapons sales to Taiwan. We should apologize for the fact that the U.S. paved the way for China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Yes, we should apologize for all these things and promise to stop all of them immediately.'' </p> <p> A confidential review by United States naval officers has concluded that Taiwan needs a significant infusion of new weapons, including a sophisticated ship-borne radar system that China has put at the top of the list of arms it does not want Taiwan to have. </p> <p> The assessment was carried out by officers from the United States Pacific Fleet, who visited Taiwan to assess its naval requirements in light of China's military buildup.  While military factors are not the only consideration, the still secret review is an important element of the deliberations about whether to sell Taiwan the radar system, known as Aegis, and other naval weapons. </p> <p> The space shuttle Endeavour blasted off today from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida carrying a giant mechanical arm that will be used to expand the growing International Space Station. </p> <p> Endeavour and its crew of seven astronauts took off on time into cloud-streaked blue skies at 2:40 p.m. as the station and its resident crew of three passed the Indian Ocean. The shuttle is to chase the station around the Earth before docking with it on Saturday. </p> <p> As the first foreign policy crisis of the Bush administration moved toward a conclusion half a world away in China, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was immersed in the politics of the Balkans today, sitting down with his European and Russian colleagues to chart the future of the troubled region where American troops remain as peacekeepers. </p> <p> During the presidential campaign,  George W. Bush the candidate made clear that he would like to reduce the troop levels in the Balkans decisively and as soon as possible. But today General Powell said that his presence at a meeting devoted to the region was ''a sign of the commitments of the Bush administration to the Balkans.'' </p> <p> Thirty-two miles off the coast of China, the crewmen of the Navy reconnaissance plane spotted Chinese fighters closing in and knew they were in trouble. As the pilot struggled with his controls, radio operators began sending coded messages back to base reporting a possible confrontation. Partway through the second message, the transmission stopped. Minutes later the aircraft crashed into the East China Sea, killing all 16 crewmen. The date was Aug. 23, 1956. </p> <p> ''We seem to be conducting something that we cannot control very well,'' President Dwight D. Eisenhower told Admiral Arthur M. Radford, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a secret meeting. ''If planes were flying 20 to 50 miles from our shores,'' Eisenhower continued, ''we would be very likely to shoot them down if they came in closer, whether through error or not.'' </p> <p> The Bush administration has put its European allies on notice that it intends to move quickly to develop a missile defense and plans to abandon or fundamentally alter the treaty that has been the keystone of arms control for nearly 30 years. </p> <p> The administration's position on the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which sets strict limits on the testing and deployment of antimissile systems, has been communicated privately to NATO allies. And it was expressed publicly in Europe in an unusually frank address last week by a senior State Department official. </p> <p> The collision between an American spy plane and a Chinese fighter jet has focused attention on China's military buildup. But none of the pilots at this air base in southern Taiwan need any reminders. </p> <p> With the Chinese mainland just 100 miles away, Taiwan's F-16 fighter aircraft roar into the air to patrol the uneasy Taiwan Strait. Their Chinese counterparts, in turn, take to the air in SU-27's and other Russian-designed fighters. </p> <p> Midway through the annual United Nations review of human rights around the world, the Bush administration has made no significant breaks with recent American policies but is finding it harder to count on the support of traditional European allies, the leader of the American delegation says. </p> <p> The official, Shirin Tahir-Kheli, who represented the earlier Bush administration at the Human Rights Commission in 1991 and 1992, said in a recent interview that she was finding ''that the world has changed, not only in East-West terms but in West-West terms as well.'' </p> <p> Chinese fighter jets have flown dangerously close to United States reconnaissance planes over the South China Sea several times in recent months, prompting complaints from American officials to the Chinese, senior Pentagon officials said today. </p> <p> The officials said it was not uncommon for Chinese jets to shadow American spy planes in that region. The one involved in the latest incident was a sophisticated, long-range maritime surveillance plane used to monitor the activities of ships, submarines and aircraft and also capable of intercepting and interpreting electronic signals from military units on land. </p> <p> Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul D. Wolfowitz was listening to the interviewer's first question when he suddenly changed the subject to his tenure as ambassador to Indonesia a decade ago. </p> <p> ''By the way, I want to interject that in Indonesia I am a major international figure,'' Mr. Wolfowitz said. ''And I have to admit that I enjoy it.'' </p> <p> The turn toward confrontation in America's relations with Russia threatens to undermine the expansion of NATO in northern Europe, a prospect that could seriously damage American security interests. If the current difficulties persist, Moscow will try to draw a red line around the Baltic states, keeping them out of the treaty organization -- and the European allies will probably go along. This would result in a fundamental weakening of NATO's role in bringing stability to post-cold-war Europe. </p> <p> During the presidential campaign, NATO enlargement was among the few foreign policy issues that caught the candidates' attention. George W. Bush and Al Gore both indicated their support for it. Among the nine countries seeking membership, Lithuania is the most advanced in reaching NATO's military standards; Latvia and Estonia are not far behind. Failure to include one of them in the next enlargement would destroy the incentive for would-be NATO members to meet those standards. </p> <p> An American diplomat is meeting skeptical Chinese officials today in an effort to convince them that President Bush's plans to build a missile defense will not undermine China's power and security. </p> <p> The diplomat, Assistant Secretary of State James A. Kelly, said he was here to begin a ''dialogue with China on security and stability that reflects today's world.'' </p> <p> As the Bush administration tries in the coming months to convince a wary world that it has nothing to fear from American plans to develop a national missile shield, the first priority should be to ensure that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld does not bring any more damage to the cause. At the very moment President Bush's emissaries were fanning out across the globe to explain his goal of defending America from missiles launched by so-called rogue states, Mr. Rumsfeld chose to announce a major reorganization of the Pentagon's space programs, including assigning responsibility to the Air Force ''to organize, train, and equip for prompt and sustained offensive and defensive space operations.'' </p> <p> While Mr. Rumsfeld claimed that these reforms had nothing to do with any intention to deploy antisatellite systems or weapons in space, such protestations were cold comfort to the very countries that the United States seeks to assuage about its missile defense program, notably Russia and China. Unfortunately, both nations now have even more reason to be concerned. </p> <p> While the Pentagon has said it wants to reduce NATO's peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, the alliance has decided that only modest cuts can safely be made at this time, Western officials say. </p> <p> Under a plan approved by NATO ambassadors this week, the alliance's peacekeeping force will be reduced from 21,000 to 18,000. The American contingent in Bosnia, which is already in the process of being cut to 3,600 troops, would be reduced to 3,100. </p> <p> With the Pentagon undergoing a major review of its global military strategy, the aircraft carrier, the backbone of the United States Navy since World War II and the very symbol of American military power abroad, is finding itself under siege. </p> <p> The threat comes not from a rival navy, but from a group of influential military thinkers who argue that carriers are becoming too costly, too slow and too vulnerable for modern warfare. Their advice to Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld: reduce the number of carriers in the fleet or stop producing new ones. </p> <p> A quarter of a century ago, a new secretary of defense, Donald H. Rumsfeld, faced a towering challenge: convincing a skeptical Congress that the post-Vietnam military needed a major infusion of money to meet the still-fearsome Soviet threat. Mr. Rumsfeld prevailed, winning the largest increase in military spending in a decade. </p> <p> Twenty-five years later, the Soviet Union has collapsed and America stands unrivaled as a military power. But Mr. Rumsfeld, now 68, is back at the Pentagon's helm. And once again he is arguing before a wary Congress that the armed forces need an expensive face-lift to counter emerging threats like terrorists with biological weapons and potentially hostile nations with long-range ballistic missiles. </p> <p> It is not surprising that the Bush administration's new effort to persuade Russia to scrap the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty has received a chilly reception in Moscow. It fails to address Russia's central concern, to ensure there are strict limits -- or at least clearly defined ones -- on the development and deployment of antimissile systems. </p> <p> That way Russia can ensure that an American missile shield can never become effective enough to neutralize Moscow's nuclear deterrent and that there are some constraints on how much the United States can exploit its technological and economic advantages. </p> <p> President Bush sketched out his vision of a brave new world today in which the United States is protected by a multifaceted antimissile shield, nuclear arsenals are slashed and Washington and Moscow work together. </p> <p> What he did not explain was how to get there. The goal of Mr. Bush's long-awaited address was to make a persuasive case for his missile-defense plan and to set the stage for high-level consultations with the United States' allies, which will get under way next week. </p> <p> Following is an excerpt from a speech by President Bush yesterday at the National Defense University in Washington regarding his international military policy, as recorded by The New York Times: </p> <p> . . . This afternoon I want us to think back some 30 years, to a far different time in a far different world. The United States and the Soviet Union were locked in a hostile rivalry. The Soviet Union was our unquestioned enemy, a highly armed threat to freedom and democracy. Far more than that wall in Berlin divided us. </p> <p> President Bush said yesterday that ''we must move beyond the constraints of the 30-year-old ABM treaty'' and establish defenses against nuclear missiles. His proposals deserve close analysis, especially with respect to their likely effectiveness and costs. They should also be subject to public debate, of which there has been stunningly little to date. </p> <p> The defensive technologies that will now be more intensively researched would be deployed in all environments -- land, sea and space. It is not clear that any, all or even parts of them will be effective. Estimates of what would be invested in this system have been wildly imprecise, varying between $60 billion and $100 billion or more. </p> <p> Itzhak Yaakov, 75, a retired brigadier general who once oversaw weapons development for the Israeli military, is at the center of a supposed spy story that may turn out to be more Kafka than le Carré. </p> <p> For more than a month Mr. Yaakov, an Israeli-American with dual citizenship who has lived in Manhattan for the last two decades, has been in an Israeli prison on charges of ''high espionage'' that carry a maximum penalty of life behind bars. </p> <p> Dick and Rummy are in the lemon-and-raspberry-striped wing chairs in the Oval Office. </p> <p> They like to kick back at the end of the day, down a Johnny Walker Red and kick around how they will organize the country and the world to their liking. </p> <p> Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld will propose on Tuesday a sweeping overhaul of the Pentagon's space programs, sharply increasing the importance of outer space in strategic planning, military officials said today. </p> <p> The proposal will be the first step toward making space a focus of Pentagon spending and is intended to emphasize the importance the administration places on developing weapon systems for outer space, the officials said. </p> <p> The Kremlin said today that its opposition to scrapping the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty would not be changed by a United States proposal that would reportedly incorporate Russian missiles and radar in a new antimissile system. </p> <p> But as in the past, Russia did not rule out further negotiations over the American missile proposal, saying officials still await ''a concrete understanding'' of how and why Washington plans to supplant the ABM treaty. </p> <p> Germany, unconvinced by President Bush's proposals for a missile defense system, today posed what an American envoy, Paul Wolfowitz, called ''very, very serious questions'' about the project. </p> <p> After meeting with German officials, Mr. Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense, said the questions centered on whether such a system could be built ''in a way that is cooperative, rather than confrontational, in a way that enhances stability rather than generating new tensions and new arms races.'' Like other allies, Germany has been troubled by the Bush administration's determination to move ahead with what is seen in Berlin as an unproven and potentially destabilizing system of deterrence that would involve the scrapping, or at least the adjustment, of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty with Moscow. </p> <p> The president of this Western-leaning, oil-rich country has warned that the Bush administration's determination to erect a broad array of missile defenses and to abandon a major arms control treaty threatens to ignite a deadly new arms race. </p> <p> In an interview in the presidential palace here, President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev urged President Bush to work with Russia and other states that have nuclear weapons to reduce strategic nuclear arsenals rather than proceed with plans to build the missile defense shield and to abandon the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty with the former Soviet Union. </p> <p> ANYONE in the Bush White House tempted to think that there are issues more important than nuclear cooperation with Russia might want to talk with Rose Gottemoeller about those 70-pound buckets of plutonium. </p> <p> Ms. Gottemoeller, an expert on the Russian nuclear arsenal, remembered visiting a plutonium storage center in Russia a few years ago, when she was working in the Clinton administration. Inside, she said, she was startled to discover that plutonium was being stored in simple metal buckets. </p> <p> Today intensive care doctors removed 5-year-old Sasha Sorokin's breathing tube, three days after the suicide bomb attack that killed his father and seriously wounded his mother. He cried hoarsely, slept on and off and whimpered in Russian to his 20-year-old uncle, German Moravchik, who sat bleary-eyed by his side. </p> <p> ''I want to go home,'' Sasha, surrounded by beeping machines, said through a wired jaw. ''I've already been here like 100 years. You don't understand me, German. I want my mama and I want to leave here now. Why don't you listen to me?'' </p> <p> The families  of those who have disappeared  and are disappearing -- in Chechnya can be seen keeping vigil outside Russia's military prisons and police stations, showing photos to those who enter. </p> <p> They can be seen navigating the topography of destruction, taking risks in mine fields where corpses are thought to be hidden, and they canvass the offices of aid workers or anyone else who keeps lists. </p> <p> President Bush's decision to build missile defenses and eventually break with a central treaty of the cold war was the first outward sign of a far-reaching debate over whether the United States should simply abandon the business of negotiating strategic arms treaties. </p> <p> So far, the debate is percolating at senior levels of the administration and among experts outside the government. </p> <p> A senior American official who in the past has advocated a full-fledged army for Japan urged Tokyo today to develop a partnership with Washington that more closely resembles the alliance between Britain and the United States. </p> <p> Referring to the ties with Japan as America's ''most important alliance in Asia,'' the official, Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage, called for even stronger bonds. </p> <p> Responding to President Bush's call to deploy missile defenses, Russia said today that it was eager to begin the new strategic dialogue that Mr. Bush suggested to devise a common approach to new missile threats and to reduce nuclear arsenals even further. </p> <p> But a senior official made clear that Moscow expected that Washington would not take ''unilateral steps'' to withdraw from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 without first replacing it with a new understanding. </p> <p> In 1969 the U.S. decided to build a missile defense that would shoot down incoming Soviet nuclear missiles. Nixon speechwriters huddled and came up with a name to inspire confidence: ''the Safeguard system.'' </p> <p> Unfortunately, Safeguard was also the name of a deodorant soap just gaining popularity. Despite derision from accommodationists who sniffed at Nixon's plan for its hard-line smell, development began of ''a bullet to hit a bullet.'' But when it became apparent that hundreds of Soviet missiles attacking at once (like a shotgun blast) could overwhelm an antimissile defense, Safeguard was shelved. </p> <p> Leaders of the Atlantic alliance clashed today over President Bush's challenge to three decades of conventional wisdom about European security, with the heads of France and Germany contradicting Mr. Bush's declaration that there was a ''new receptivity'' to his plan for a missile defense shield. </p> <p> Although Mr. Bush said he had made ''good progress here in Europe'' on the plan, the reactions of those two key allies showed he is still confronting profound apprehensions about abandoning the 1972 Antiballistic Missile treaty between Washington and Moscow. </p> <p> The Pentagon will ask Congress for permission to begin scrapping all 50 of its nuclear-tipped MX missiles as a possible first step toward a unilateral reduction in the nation's nuclear arsenal, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld announced today. </p> <p> The missiles with their multiple warheads and ability to decimate Russian missile silos, were a signature program of President Ronald Reagan, whose administration fought acrimonious battles with Congressional Democrats over the size of the program and the basing of the missile, which it called the Peacekeeper, in the 1980's. </p> <p> Senate Democrats sharply questioned Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld today about the high cost and unproven effectiveness of a national missile defense system, and they raised deep concerns about the administration's threats to withdraw from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile  Treaty if the Russians refused to amend it. </p> <p> During his first hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee since his confirmation, Mr. Rumsfeld met a surprisingly unified skepticism from liberal and centrist Democrats regarding missile defense, signaling the difficulties President Bush is likely to face when he tries to sell a plan to Congress later this year. </p> <p> In his first foray into the Balkans, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld heard today from American troops and commanders about the difficulties of stemming ethnic fighting along the Kosovo-Macedonia border, where some Bush administration officials want to curtail the United States' role. </p> <p> Traveling by Blackhawk helicopter in the shadow of Kosovo's snow-capped peaks, Mr. Rumsfeld surveyed the intricate networks of mountain trails used by Albanian rebels to smuggle weapons into Macedonia from Kosovo. He also talked to soldiers involved in gun battles along the border and was shown dozens of weapons seized from smugglers in recent weeks. </p> <p> IN his narrow office in the West Wing of the White House, Stephen J. Hadley keeps two small mementos. One is a cluster of models of every American intercontinental ballistic missile, from the Titan to the Peacekeeper, a reminder of his final days at the Defense Department in 1992, when he helped begin talks with Russia over sharing technology to build a missile defense system. </p> <p> ''It was going fine,'' Mr. Hadley recalled recently, ''until the Russians figured out that George Herbert Walker Bush was not going to be re-elected.'' </p> <p> In his first five months in office, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld ensconced himself in his Pentagon office to rethink defense policy in sphinx-like silence. But that changed last week during his first extended trip to Europe for the Bush administration. </p> <p> Over seven days, Mr. Rumsfeld held court in seven countries, offering detailed thoughts on military strategy, the problems with treaties and the need for America to project immense power to ''deter and dissuade'' its enemies. </p> <p> Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld said today that the United States is likely to deploy certain antiballistic missile systems before testing on them is completed, signaling the speed with which the Bush administration hopes to develop and use the still-unproven technology. </p> <p> In a meeting of NATO defense ministers, Mr. Rumsfeld outlined a two-tiered approach in which the administration intends to continue consultations with its skeptical allies and Russia, even as the Pentagon moves as swiftly as possible to develop and deploy systems. </p> <p> President Bush called today for an Atlantic Alliance that would stretch all the way to Russia's borders, delving more emphatically and aggressively than any of his predecessors into a matter guaranteed to make Moscow nervous. </p> <p> On the day before his first meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Bush used a speech in the capital of this former Soviet bloc country to urge a broad, steady expansion of NATO into the countries of Eastern Europe that are not now in the alliance. [Excerpt, Page A8.] </p> <p> The wife of the spy suspect Robert P. Hanssen has told the authorities that he confided to her and to a Roman Catholic priest approximately 20 years ago that he had begun supplying information to the K.G.B., government officials and others involved in the case said. </p> <p> She said the priest initially urged Mr. Hanssen to turn himself in, they said, but then changed his mind and persuaded Mr. Hanssen to donate the $20,000 he had received from the Soviets to charity. </p> <p> The Bush administration played down the importance of a friendship pact between Moscow and Beijing today, saying it represented short-term interests rather than a long-term strategy that should concern the United States. </p> <p> ''This was clearly designed to boost both of their international standing without adding much real substance,'' said Richard L. Armitage, a deputy secretary of state. </p> <p> The Pentagon is preparing to ask Congress for money to build a missile defense test site in Alaska that could also become the command center for a working antimissile system as early as 2004, military officials said. </p> <p> If it becomes operational, the site will be a clear violation of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which allows some testing of antimissile technology but forbids deployment of a shield against long-range missiles in any state except North Dakota. </p> <p> The Bush administration, which has already pulled away from a range of international treaties, warned today that it would not join a pact to curtail the international flow of illegal small arms if it infringed on the American right to own guns. </p> <p> Speaking to the opening session of a conference on the trafficking of weapons that fuel increasingly brutal civil wars and expanding networks of organized crime, John R. Bolton, under secretary of state for arms control and international security affairs, invoked the Second Amendment. </p> <p> Russia stated officially today that it is confused. </p> <p> Confused, strategically speaking, on whether the Bush administration is planning to withdraw from, negotiate changes to, or simply ''bump up against'' the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. </p> <p> Senior Pentagon officials announced details today of an ambitious missile-testing plan that they said could lead to a working system of land-based, sea-launched and airborne weapons in four years. Senate Democrats immediately attacked the proposal, saying it was highly likely to violate the Antiballistic Missile Treaty within a year. </p> <p> Democrats, responding to testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, accused the Bush administration of being intentionally vague about the new plan to lure Congress into financing work that might violate the ABM treaty next year. And they threatened to block any spending that seemed likely to breach that treaty. </p> <p> A portfolio of young Russian soldiers returning from service in Chechnya. </p> <p> Maxim, 21, Moscow (left): ''By Aug. 20, 1999, we were already there. At first we went to Dagestan, since the bandit units invaded Dagestan first, then we moved into Chechnya. I was a mechanic and drove a truck that moved infantry around. In the first battle, the enemy was right in front of my eyes. I saw the dead bodies of Chechens everywhere. I even had to drive on dead bodies, not because I liked it, but because there was no road. Honestly, I felt so awful at first, I couldn't stand it. Later, I got used to it, because if you don't kill the enemy, then he will kill you. The president and the cabinet and the Duma -- all of them are interested in continuing this war as long as possible. I stopped going to elections, because I see corruption everywhere. It's difficult to adjust to a normal life after war. The worst thing is when everybody asks how many people I killed, as if I got pleasure out of murder. They're joking, of course. People who haven't been in the army can't understand. I just tell everyone, I swore a solemn oath, and I obeyed orders.'' </p> <p> The United States military has succeeded for only the second time in shooting down an intercontinental ballistic missile, but Pentagon officials warned today that much more development would be needed before the technology could reliably destroy real weapons. </p> <p> A prototype interceptor fired from Kwajalein atoll in the Marshall Islands demolished a dummy warhead 140 miles above the Pacific late Saturday night, scoring the first hit for the Pentagon's missile defense program since October 1999. In between, there were two failed tests that raised doubts about the costly program's future. </p> <p> A Bush administration review of American assistance to Russia has concluded that most of the programs aimed at helping Russia stop the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons are vital to American security and should be continued, a senior administration official says. Some may even be expanded. </p> <p> But the White House wants to restructure or end two programs: a $2.1 billion effort to dispose of hundreds of tons of military plutonium and a program to shrink Russian cities that were devoted to nuclear weapons development, and to provide alternative jobs for nuclear scientists, the official said in an interview on Friday. Both these programs have been criticized in Congress. </p> <p> The Pentagon will notify Congress on Monday that it plans to begin preparatory work in mid-August on a new missile-defense test site at Fort Greely, in Alaska, the first step in a more aggressive testing program. </p> <p> Pentagon officials said today that they would award a contract of more than $8 million by Aug. 15 for preliminary work on five missile silos. </p> <p> Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, offered President Vladimir V. Putin an American blueprint today for talks on building a new nuclear-weapons framework, a process she cast as part of a broader White House plan for ''transforming'' the relationship between Washington and Moscow. </p> <p> Ms. Rice said that President Bush hoped to meet Mr. Putin twice this fall, in Shanghai and in Washington, and that members of Mr. Bush's cabinet were planning trips here in the coming months. Two of them -- Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans -- were in Moscow today, meeting with Mr. Putin and other senior officials. </p> <p> A naval band struck up a patriotic medley as the wife of an executive of the Dutch maritime company Mammoet smashed a Champagne bottle against the steel-plated hull of a 300-foot-long structure possessing all the elegance of an ocean-going lunch box. Still, the yard workers treated it like the Queen Mary, and a Russian Orthodox priest sprinkled holy water on the hull and blessed it before it inched forward toward the White Sea. </p> <p> The object of all the attention was the first of two large pontoons that will help in trying to raise the nuclear submarine Kursk from the bottom of the Barents Sea next month. The pontoon is one huge piece of an engineering puzzle that must fit together seamlessly by mid-September if the Kursk is to be raised this year. </p> <p> Robert P. Hanssen, the former F.B.I. agent, has told the bureau that he spied for two different Soviet intelligence agencies during different periods of his long espionage career, and investigators now believe that decision may have helped protect him from being caught earlier, law enforcement officials said today. </p> <p> Mr. Hanssen, who pleaded guilty to spying for Moscow last month, is being debriefed by counterintelligence experts. In the first disclosures of what he has revealed, law enforcement officials said he had told the bureau that he began spying in 1979, six years earlier than the agency had believed when he was arrested in February. Mr. Hanssen is said to have spied from 1979 through 1981, quit, and then begun to spy again in 1985. </p> <p> Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld is about to travel 10,000 miles to Moscow and back for one day of talks on missile defense and nuclear reductions at which no agreements are expected -- because, many officials believe, the outcome is preordained and the American position has prevailed. </p> <p> On missile defense, the United States is unyielding. </p> <p> Under Secretary of State John R. Bolton said tonight that ''a vast open space'' still exists for an agreement with Russia  on joint development of a limited  defense against ballistic missiles,  but that the time for such an accord was running out. </p> <p> Mr. Bolton denied, however, that he had issued an unofficial deadline of November for reaching such an agreement. </p> <p> This is a tale of two unveilings. The first came on July 11, 1995. In an unusual ceremony at its Langley, Va., headquarters, the Central Intelligence Agency released to the public, with great fanfare, the long-secret results of one of its greatest coups: a chunk of decrypted 1940's cables from the Soviet Union that included the names and cover names of about 200 American spies. The code name for the American interception and decoding was Venona. </p> <p> After the ceremony came an outpouring. Longtime defenders of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who had been executed as spies, issued mea culpas. Critics assaulted the new material's credibility; scholars returned home from examining Soviet archives to assert Venona's basic soundness. Books issued forth, and magazines covered the debate's every twist. They still do. </p> <p> International arms sales grew 8 percent last year, to nearly $36.9 billion, with the United States further consolidating its stature as the supplier of choice, especially in developing countries, according to a new Congressional report. </p> <p> American manufacturers signed contracts for just under $18.6 billion, or about half of all weapons sold on the world market during 2000, with 68 percent of the American weapons bought by developing countries. </p> <p> Drawing clear battle lines with the White House on foreign policy, Representative Richard A. Gephardt accused the Bush administration today of an obsession with missile defense and of pursuing a unilateralist approach to world affairs that risks antagonizing Russia and undermining relations with Europe. </p> <p> Mr. Gephardt, the House minority leader, vowed to unite Democrats and persuade Republicans to forge a bipartisan majority in Congress to block any missile defense system that would violate the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. He also defended formal arms control negotiations as essential to maintaining the nuclear peace. </p> <p> Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld arrived today to discuss a new strategic military framework with Russia, after admitting it won't be easy. </p> <p> Making his first visit to Moscow as defense secretary, Mr. Rumsfeld said no breakthroughs were expected toward his goal of deploying missile defenses and reducing strategic arsenals. </p> <p> A program conceived by the Clinton administration to rid the world of 100 tons of American and Russian weapons-grade plutonium is likely to be abandoned by the Bush administration, according to people who have been briefed about the project. </p> <p> Under the plan, which was first proposed in the mid-90's, 50 tons of American plutonium and 50 tons of Russian plutonium would be taken out of nuclear weapons and either converted into fuel for nuclear reactors or rendered useless for weapons by mixing it with with highly radioactive nuclear waste, a process known as immobilization. </p> <p> Within hours of President Bush's speech to Congress on Thursday night demanding that the militant Muslim clerics who rule Afghanistan hand over Osama bin Laden, their envoy gave today what was described as their final answer: ''No, no, no!'' </p> <p> The rebuff was delivered by the clerics' emissary to Pakistan, Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, at a news conference here in the Pakistan capital, where he had traveled after consulting in Kandahar with Mullah Muhammad Omar, the supreme leader of the Taliban Islamic movement, which rules most of Afghanistan. </p> <p> As White House officials move to refocus President Bush's energies on the precarious economy, they are working to present him as a more commanding leader in what may be the most treacherous stretch of his first year in the White House. </p> <p> The economic and political challenges facing Mr. Bush were underscored earlier this week when his senior adviser, Karl Rove, joined more than a dozen prominent Republicans for a private dinner and heard an unvarnished critique of Mr. Bush's style and strategy. </p> <p> The tiny, long-ignored embassy of the alliance of Afghan rebel groups fighting the Taliban was buzzing with activity today. American diplomats and Russian generals are coming courting, testing the mettle of the new commander of the Northern Alliance, appointed after his predecessor died from wounds suffered in an assassination everyone here blames on the Taliban's most infamous guest, Osama bin Laden. </p> <p> American officials -- who in general have ignored the alliance for years -- contacted the group last Wednesday, seeking possible cooperation, rebel leaders said. </p> <p> As American military operations move toward what could be the first deployment of Western troops on former Soviet soil,  Russia's policy of giving the Western war on terrorism full moral support -- and so far not much else -- is about to hit a dead end. </p> <p> What the Kremlin does next in Central Asia has the potential to alter relations with Europe and the United States, for better or worse, for years to come. The Russians are clearly anguished by their options. </p> <p> ''Everyone is looking for a safe haven, and Russia is not one.'' </p> <p> That assessment from a Russian investment banker captured the frustrating reality for several Russian companies that had planned to tap international stock and bond markets for new capital this fall. Deals are being reconsidered or postponed as the companies watch for signs of how much investor interest remains after the terrorist attacks in the United States last week. </p> <p> A senior Russian official said today that Moscow was willing to consider amendments to the ''present-day system of agreements on strategic stability'' with the United States, but he insisted that the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 had to be preserved in negotiations that were quite likely to be long-term and complex. </p> <p> The statement, carried by the Interfax news agency, was in response to reports from Washington that quoted a senior administration official who suggested that Russia was on the verge of accepting an American proposal to amend the ABM treaty and allow more rigorous American missile shield tests. </p> <p> President  Bush's call for a global coalition against terrorism continued to gain support overseas today as Russia, in a rare joint statement with NATO, expressed its anger over Tuesday's attacks in New York and Washington and called for a worldwide effort to combat such acts. </p> <p> After a special meeting here, the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council issued a statement saying that while NATO allies and Russia ''have suffered from terrorist attacks against civilians, the horrific scale of the attacks of 11 September is without precedent in modern history.'' </p> <p> In a patch of fire-scorched forest in central Alaska, under the shadow of towering peaks, construction crews have been carving the outlines of a 135-acre missile field at an Army base here, 100 miles south of Fairbanks. They are laying the foundations for a rudimentary missile defense site. </p> <p> But as those crews rush to beat winter's subzero temperatures and pounding snows, their work may complicate the Bush administration's efforts to keep Russia in an international coalition to fight terrorism in the aftermath of the attacks on New York and Washington. </p> <p> To see why Russia has enthusiastically backed President Bush's call for a global war against terrorism, look at who visited the Kremlin last week. And to see why that enthusiasm shows signs of flagging so soon, look at who did not. </p> <p> The visitor was Ariel Sharon, the third prime minister of Israel to come to Moscow since 1999. </p> <p> Asked by President Bush to choose sides in the war on terrorism, most of the world has chosen to side with the West, but not without adding the kind of caveats bound to create fault lines in an American-led coalition. </p> <p> The demand by Mr. Bush in his address to Congress nine days ago could not have been more clear. ''Every nation in every region now has a decision to make,'' he said. ''Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.'' </p> <p> Officials in Europe, the United States and Pakistan say they have identified new elements of the bin Laden terrorist network, including a top lieutenant in Europe and a previously undisclosed cell in the Gaza Strip. </p> <p> At least 11,000 terrorists have been trained in the past five years at camps operated by Osama bin laden across the border in Afghanistan, these officials say. Many have since been dispatched abroad to destinations unknown. </p> <p> There are 14,453 entries in the Book of Remembrance, two thick volumes bound in brown leather and locked in a green cabinet, in a converted two-room office in a working-class apartment building in far southern Moscow. </p> <p> Aleksei Parfyonov, a 37-year-old security guard who spent the mid-1980's as a Soviet rifleman in Afghanistan, cradles the volumes as if they were Bibles. ''The idea they sent us in with, it was just like the Americans,'' he said. ''When we entered Afghanistan, we were going to fight terrorism, too.'' </p> <p> President Bush said today that the United States was ''in hot pursuit'' of both Osama bin Laden and the Taliban forces harboring him in Afghanistan. </p> <p> Senior military officials insisted that there were no American military forces currently on the ground in Afghanistan. That, however, did not preclude the possibility that they had already gone in and come out. </p> <p> This ancient trading city languishes on a plateau surrounded by sheer-walled mountains on three sides and a tract of land so vast and forbidding that for centuries people have described it as ''the dump where Allah put the rubbish of Creation.'' </p> <p> Despite the bleak terrain and often inhospitable climate, Quetta has thrived down the centuries as a center for commerce on the ancient Silk Road stretching from Persia to China and the home of tribal groups whose loyalties bowed neither to the sword of invaders nor the demands of governments. </p> <p> President Bush ordered heavy bombers and other aircraft to within easy  striking distance of Afghanistan today and insisted that its ruling Taliban turn over Osama bin Laden and other suspected leaders of a terrorist organization believed to be behind last week's attacks in New York and Washington. </p> <p> The White House also announced that Mr. Bush would address a joint  meeting of Congress on Thursday evening to lay out his aims for what he has called a global war on terrorism and to detail the sacrifices that might be asked of the American public. </p> <p> Without any systematic analysis, without the usual process of review  among government departments, the United States has adopted an entirely new foreign policy. By elevating the fight against terrorism to the highest priority, the Bush administration has changed the basic premises of American involvement overseas. America's policy now implies the formation of a new antiterrorist alliance with Russia, China and India as well as members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Japan and other nations. </p> <p> Such a great-power alliance for international order has not been seen since the mid-19th century, when the threat came from liberal revolutionaries rather than religious fanatics.  Inevitably, the new foreign policy collides with old priorities, whether in regard to human rights in China, for example, or missile defense, which can no longer be imposed on Russia because we need it as an ally. </p> <p> Picture this: A river in Afghanistan, late fall 1987. A group of young men are fishing. They prepare their bait -- something that looks like a marshmallow on a stick -- and toss it into the river. Boom! Fish float to the surface, some dead, some alive. The men laugh and splash around in the water harvesting their catch. The cameraman shouts at them not to get his camera wet. </p> <p> This image -- by turns playful and violent, backward and modern -- is part of an archive of 700 hours of videotape and 12,000 photographs taken by Afghans to document the war between the mujahedeen (which literally means the people of the jihad or holy struggle) and the Soviet Union in Afghanistan from 1987 to 1995. The very last images are of the Taliban taking Kabul. In retrospect it seems to record how Afghanistan fell apart, leaving an open field for terrorists. </p> <p> Iran's defense minister arrived in Moscow today to conclude long-delayed talks on a large purchase of Russian arms, an agenda now likely to be joined by discussions of Tehran's role in a global campaign against terror. </p> <p> The United States, which bitterly opposed the sale of Russian weapons to Iran but just as clearly wants to keep both nations enlisted in that campaign, is certain to be watching the talks closely. </p> <p> The exiled king of Afghanistan and leaders of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance agreed today to convene an emergency ''Supreme Council'' here by the end of this month, as a first step toward  replacing their country's militant Islamic rulers. </p> <p> The council would be ready to step in if the Taliban is forced out, they said. Both the former king and the opposition commanders made clear that they believe that their plan is a way not just to rid their country of the Taliban, but to avoid American reprisals against Afghanistan, where the terror suspect Osama bin Laden is under Taliban protection. </p> <p> European leaders quickly voiced support for the military operations begun today by the United States and Britain against targets in Afghanistan, with France and Germany saying they could eventually take part as well. </p> <p> In Russia, which used to put its air-defense system on alert whenever American forces made significant moves, the Foreign Ministry instead issued a statement of support, saying the ''time had come for decisive action'' against terrorism. </p> <p> Word travels fast in this corner of paradise, the narrow twisting streets of the Maisuma quarter, a hotbed of Kashmiri separatism. Among the narrow stalls of copper craftsmen pounding out kitchen utensils and little halls decked with ribbons for bridegroom receptions this wedding season before Ramadan, people craned to look around corners, and young men walked in the opposite direction at a pace a little quicker than casual. </p> <p> Someone had been shot, dead. </p> <p> The United States has signed an agreement with Uzbekistan to remove deadly anthrax from a remote island in the Aral Sea where the Soviet Union dumped tons of lethal spores, Bush administration and Uzbek officials said yesterday. </p> <p> They said the agreement reflected growing concern that terrorists or rogue states might seek to obtain the anthrax spores, which the Soviet Union secretly buried on the island in 1988. </p> <p> They hold meetings, drink green tea, hold more meetings, drink more tea. Occasionally, they call Washington or Islamabad or Rome. These are exciting days. The world seems to have turned upside down, and that means they may be back on top. </p> <p> Peshawar, the capital of the Afghan diaspora, is the meeting place of exiled commanders, politicians, mullahs and a million refugees. Since Sept. 11, it has provided the intrigue of Casablanca. Men who were once very important are making big plans to be important again in an imagined post-Taliban Afghanistan. Some of these men see themselves as future leaders. </p> <p> The terror attacks of Sept. 11 forced an immediate and radical shift in American relations with the rest of the world. What had been a drifting search for a foreign policy by a new Republican administration suddenly acquired a hard, overarching purpose, in which friends and foes were coldly redefined according to whether they were with the United States or against it. </p> <p> The realignments have been staggering. A few short weeks ago, Washington viewed Central Asia, if it viewed the region at all, as a nest of nasty despots; Russia was a nagging has-been doing bad things in Chechnya, and the United Nations was a bloated organization whose conference on racism had to be boycotted. The Mideast was a quagmire, but the real threats were in Asia -- the rogues in North Korea and the increasingly assertive rulers in China. </p> <p> Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister, warned the United States tonight that it risked appeasing Arab nations the way European democracies appeased Hitler on the eve of World War II. </p> <p> It was an unusually harsh and public rebuke of Israel's most valued ally, and it reflected rising frustration within the Israeli government over the Bush administration's approach to battling terrorism. ''Do not try to appease the Arabs at our expense,'' Mr. Sharon said. ''We cannot accept this.'' </p> <p> A Russian airliner carrying 76 people including scores of Jewish holiday celebrants traveling from Tel Aviv to Novosibirsk in Siberia exploded and plunged into the Black Sea off Russia's coast today. </p> <p> All 64 passengers and 12 crew members of the Siberian Airlines jet, a Tupolev Tu-154, were presumed dead after the stricken plane plunged from some 30,000 feet into the sea about 87 miles off the Russian coastal town of Dzhubga. </p> <p> The 86-year-old exiled king of Afghanistan, who has spent decades in near-total isolation here, met with anti-Taliban military commanders of the Northern Alliance and an American congressional delegation at his home today, where the Americans promised to help him unite his countrymen against the militant Islamic Taliban government. </p> <p> After the meeting, at King Mohammad Zahir Shah's heavily guarded villa outside Rome, Representative Curt Weldon, a Pennsylvania Republican, told reporters, ''We think that perhaps he is the person that can rally those against the Taliban most effectively.'' </p> <p> After five days of American airstrikes on Afghanistan, the goals set by President Bush in committing  military power -- rooting out Al Qaeda terrorists and the Taliban government with them -- have become deeply entangled in the murky politics that have kept Afghans fighting for more than 20 years. </p> <p> The American bombers and cruise missiles that continued to hit Kabul, Kandahar and other strategic centers today have taken aim at Taliban military defenses that rely mostly on outdated, poorly-maintained Soviet military equipment from the 1980's. But the United States' overwhelming advantage in firepower shows signs of being blunted, even neutralized, by political restraints growing out of bitter Afghan political rivalries. </p> <p> As if to prove that he has survived the heaviest American bombing so far in Afghanistan, the Taliban's supreme leader broke four days of silence today with an appeal to his soldiers not to buckle under pressure from the United States. </p> <p> ''We are confronted with a big infidel,'' Mullah Muhammad Omar said in an address relayed to Taliban troops over a military radio network that appears to be the Taliban's last remaining communications system. ''This is a test. The people are suffering, but this is a test we shall pass, God willing.'' </p> <p> As they begin the hunt for whoever sent highly concentrated anthrax to Congress, the government's science detectives are focusing on whether it came from a foreign scientist or nation experienced in making biological weapons, officials say. </p> <p> The best evidence may come from the anthrax itself. Experts said the process that produces the sort of high-quality spores that government officials said were found in a letter to the Senate majority leader leaves clues that might point to its origin. </p> <p> A dozen years ago in Termez, a dusty Uzbekistan border town that may again become a dateline, I watched the Russian Army begin its retreat from Afghanistan. As paratroopers crossed a railroad bridge into the waiting arms of parents and girlfriends, an all-girl, all-drum band from a local school tapped out a cheerless homecoming rhythm. When I asked the soldiers what they had accomplished down there, expecting at least a rehearsed sample of national pride, they would stare blankly. ''We survived,'' one weary private shrugged. The war that had sent home 15,000 zinc coffins had also killed off a lot of illusions. </p> <p> No, this is not another warning about the perils of Afghanistan. The American officials I've talked to understand the frustrations of playing hide-and-seek in a mountain labyrinth. They appreciate the lethal instability of that country's tribal politics. The risks they take will be as calculated as they are justified. </p> <p> As forces of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance showed off 40 Russian-built battle tanks in a military parade in northern Afghanistan, its leaders suggested that an offensive against the Taliban could come in the form of a powerful strike toward Kabul coordinated with American air strikes. </p> <p> The military parade on a parched plain close to the border with Tajikistan included 3,000 uniformed reservists, armored personnel carriers and 10 rocket launchers. It was by far the largest display of matériel by the Northern Alliance since it became a chief focus of American-led efforts to dislodge Afghanistan's militant Islamic Taliban government. </p> <p> As Black Sea salvage ships ferried the shattered wreckage of a Siberian Airlines jet to Russia's shore, Pentagon officials said they strongly believed that a long-range antiaircraft missile fired during a major Ukrainian training exercise had struck the jet before it exploded and crashed Thursday. </p> <p> One Pentagon official said intercepted telemetry data on the path of the missile showed a single missile had gone ''wildly off course'' before the plane exploded. </p> <p> Since the terror attacks in the United States on Sept. 11, several governments in Central Europe have called for tighter security precautions, possibly reversing the direction of democratic gains the nations have made since the fall of Communism. </p> <p> One critic of the trend is Amnesty International. In a report being put out on Thursday in London, the rights group warns that ''In the name of fighting 'international terrorism,' '' governments have rushed to introduce new measures that threaten the human rights of their own citizens, immigrants and refugees.'' </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, moving swiftly to capitalize on the newfound solidarity with the West over fighting terrorism, indicated today that he might show flexibility over NATO expansion and agreed with European Union officials to consult monthly on security affairs. </p> <p> Mr. Putin's tone, inconceivable a few months ago, was echoed by  NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson, who said that he and Mr. Putin had developed ''a habit of straight talk'' that was transforming the relationship between NATO and Russia. </p> <p> The discovery of what government officials say is high-grade anthrax in a letter mailed to Congress is the most worrisome development yet in a series of bioterrorist attacks that has already rattled the nation. </p> <p> The officials and weapons experts said yesterday that it suggested that somewhere, someone has access to the sort of germ weapons capable of inflicting huge casualties. </p> <p> Russian investigators released dramatic pictures of the drydocked wreck of the nuclear submarine Kursk today which appear to show that explosions that sank the boat 14 months ago also spread a ferocious fire and destruction through much of its interior. </p> <p> Vladimir Ustinov, Russia's prosecutor general and the head of a criminal inquiry into the disaster, said the ruin of twisted metal and scorched equipment extended well into the 490-foot-long submarine. It was apparent, he said, that none of the 116 crew members and two civilians aboard lived for more than eight hours after the boat fell to the floor of the Barents Sea, 356 feet below the surface. </p> <p> Two years ago, an obscure Muslim spiritual leader named Sheik Muhammad Hisham Kabbani stepped to the microphone at the State Department and issued a chilling admonition to Americans to beware the Muslims in their midst. </p> <p> He warned that Islamic extremists had infiltrated the vast majority of American Muslim mosques and student and community groups, and that they had bought more than 20 nuclear warheads and were paying former Soviet scientists to break them into chips that could be carried in suitcases. </p> <p> President Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, says Russia's leaders are becoming persuaded that the administration's plans to test a missile defense system are ''not actually a threat'' to Moscow. </p> <p> Ms. Rice's assessment of the negotiations with Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, marks the first time that an administration official of her rank has suggested that Russia is dropping its objections to the Pentagon's proposed testing plans. </p> <p> Before he defected to America, Dr. Ken Alibek was the Soviet Union's ranking expert in turning anthrax and a dozen other killer germs into biological  weapons. Their power to terrorize is only now fully dawning here in his picture-perfect suburban neighborhood. </p> <p> ''That was my life,'' says Dr. Alibek, busy now with an entirely different role in which his expertise in doomsday germs is being devoted, in effect, to undoing his own past. </p> <p> Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld is planning to leave this week for Russia and nations near Afghanistan as the Bush administration strives to hold together its coalition for the military campaign against Osama bin Laden and the Taliban government that protects him. </p> <p> The United States has deployed 1,000  Army troops, as well as special operations forces, in Uzbekistan, a move that Mr. Rumsfeld helped arrange on a previous trip. Now the military may need more cooperation from Central Asian states to keep up military pressure on the Taliban, support the Northern Alliance and continue its search for Mr. bin Laden. </p> <p> Six years after it stopped major arms sales to Iran under pressure from the United States, Russia signed a new military accord with Iran today that the Kremlin said could lead to $300 million in annual sales of jets, missiles and other weapons. </p> <p> Russia's atomic energy ministry also announced that it plans to deliver next month the first of two nuclear reactors for a 1,000-megawatt power station being built largely by Russian technicians at Bushire, an Iranian port on the Persian Gulf. </p> <p> In the late 1980's, an American-based agent for Al Qaeda, the terrorist network led by Osama bin Laden, shipped to Afghanistan 25 military-style rifles capable of shooting down helicopters, piercing armor or destroying fuel tanks from long distances, according to a report by a gun control organization. </p> <p> The American-made weapons, Barrett .50-caliber rifles, were apparently used by Muslim militias trained by Mr. bin Laden to fight Soviet troops in Afghanistan, the report by the Violence Policy Center says. </p> <p> Investigators entered the hull of the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk today in a closed military port on the Barents Sea, removing the bodies of three of the 118 sailors who perished when the craft sank 14 months ago. </p> <p> At a news conference later in Murmansk, near the port of Roslyakovo where the sub is kept, officials said recovery work would continue around the clock until they were certain that no more bodies were inside. </p> <p> The United States and Uzbekistan announced an agreement on Friday that would give the American military flexibility in operating from bases in the former Soviet republic  in return for Washington's assurance to protect Uzbekistan's security. </p> <p> The joint statement itself underscores that the United States and Uzbekistan have established a ''qualitatively new relationship'' that involved a long-term commitment by each side. </p> <p> It felt almost like a normal Sunday. The skies were clear, the day was delightfully balmy, the Marathon went smoothly, with new records for men and women, the historic Trinity Church in Lower Manhattan reopened for normal Sunday worship, and the talk over brunches in packed sidewalk cafes was not anthrax, for a change, but whether the Yankees could recover from the previous night's drubbing. </p> <p> A DAY OF REST, MAINLY -- The crisis, to be sure, was always hovering in the background. The 25,000 participants in the New York City Marathon were warned not to accept any refreshments from unknown bystanders, and red, white and blue were the ubiquitous colors of the race. There was also a new report that a trace of anthrax had been found on a package sent to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's chief of staff from NBC News. </p> <p> In the last year, there have been dozens of violations of nuclear security rules in Russia and at least one loss of fissile material; Taliban emissaries have tried to recruit Russian scientists, and terrorists have tried to stake out a Russian nuclear storage site at least twice, say senior officials of the International Atomic Energy Agency and Western governments. </p> <p> The officials detailed the incidents, citing conversations with Russian officials and verified news reports. Despite significant improvements in Russian nuclear security in the 1990's -- some of it with American money and advice -- up to half of ex-Soviet civilian and military nuclear stockpiles with weapons-grade material are not well protected. </p> <p> The rout of the Taliban from Afghan cities continued apace yesterday, and there were reports that Pashtun tribes in the south, the ethnic base of the Taliban, were rising up and challenging the Taliban even in its stronghold of Kandahar. </p> <p> Reports from around Afghanistan indicated that as much as 80 percent of the country now appeared to be out of the control of the Taliban, some of it in the hands of the rebel Northern Alliance. But with the situation in Afghanistan in total flux, it was difficult to discern which forces or factions controlled which areas -- or how much fight was left in the Taliban, the Islamic radicals who had imposed their rigid rule on most of the country for seven years. </p> <p> A combination of heavy-duty bombs and more precise target information from Russia and from American Special Operations forces on the ground have helped the United States escalate attacks on caves and tunnels in Afghanistan that have been identified as Taliban arms depots and command centers, military officials said today. </p> <p> The bombing, which has included the use of 5,000-pound bunker-busters, came as American Special Operations forces deepened their involvement in the conflict. Today, commandos spirited out of southern Afghanistan a prominent opposition leader, Hamid Karzai, who has been trying to organize a rebellion in the Taliban's stronghold, a military official said. </p> <p> The night of Oct. 15 found Colin Powell inside the heavily fortified residence of the American ambassador in Islamabad, dining with his improbable new best friend, the president of Pakistan. Just a few months earlier, when the Bush administration was beginning to compose its tableau of friends and foes, a Powell deputy was sent to court India, a democracy and possible counterweight to China, as America's darling in South Asia. Pakistan was passed over as a terrorist-cradling rogue nation. But war changes everything, and Gen. Pervez Musharraf was now our partner against the terrorists in neighboring Afghanistan. This was Powell's first face-to-face meeting with the Pakistani strongman, and he was impressed with what he found. Like Powell himself, Musharraf was a pragmatic military man, brimming with self-assurance, equally at ease talking tactical soldiery or political strategy, a man given to thinking three or four steps ahead. </p> <p> Powell was in Islamabad to reassure the Pakistanis that the United States would not, as it had in the past, abandon Pakistan once the war was over and to proffer some tangible rewards, including an end to sanctions imposed to punish Pakistan's nuclear testing and help in rescheduling a staggering national debt. This was a gamble for Musharraf, enlisting with America against a viral Islamic hatred incubated, among other places, in Pakistan. The streets were simmering with angry protests. As a precaution against a stray shoulder-fired missile, Powell had ended his 17-hour flight with a lights-out, banking dive into the Islamabad airport. And for security reasons, the dinner was not listed on the schedule handed out to his traveling press entourage. </p> <p> When President Bush and Vladimir Putin meet next week, one aim will be to resolve differences about the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. With much at stake in the war against terror and in Russia's hopes to be seen as a part of the West, no one wants the developing closeness of the United States and Russia to be held back by the old argument about an American missile shield. </p> <p> Before Sept. 11, the Bush administration was saying bluntly that the ABM treaty, banning most missile defense, was anachronistic and that the United States might simply break it. Now the need for Russian support in the Afghanistan war makes cooperation more attractive than unilateral pronouncements. But this issue is not as difficult as it seems. The treaty could be modified fairly easily to allow what we need to do. </p> <p> The Russians are back. </p> <p> A faint shadow of the army that laid waste to this country throughout the 1980's, more than a dozen olive drab Russian military trucks formed a rough compound today behind camouflage netting on a vacant lot by the Bulgarian Embassy. A line of pale, very young men in blue uniforms and bulletproof vests, and carrying combat knives and assault rifles, stood guard. </p> <p> Twenty-five feet below the streets of Beijing, Feng Guangbin rattled off the remarkable attributes of the maze of vaulted tunnels that stretched out in four directions from the dim intersection at which he stood. </p> <p> ''Down that way we can even reach Taipei,'' he told a slack-jawed cluster of tourists from Taiwan, who appeared to believe China's Communist Party capable of anything. Mr. Feng went on to explain in his practiced patter that the tunnel ran 20 miles to the Beijing airport, from where it was possible to travel to the Taiwanese capital by plane. </p> <p> Experts on nuclear arms are uncertain how many weapons would actually be dismantled under President Bush's proposal and how many simply placed in some kind of storage, where they would no longer be ''operationally deployed,'' in his words. </p> <p> But American weapons destined for destruction will end up at the Pantex plant near the Texas panhandle town of Amarillo, the place where warheads are made and where they go to die. The plant, a place of concrete bunkers surrounded by razor wire and patrolled by guards armed with machine guns, has been taking apart thousands of decommissioned weapons for decades. </p> <p> President Bush did not mention it, but the arms control approach he presented today would undo one of the signal accomplishments of his father's administration: the ban on multiple-warhead missiles based on land. </p> <p> Throughout the cold war, it was widely assumed that such missiles were particularly destabilizing weapons. NATO was so worried about the Soviet Union's 10-warhead SS-18 that its code name for the missile was Satan, and Reagan administration hard-liners warned darkly that it would be useful for a surprise strike. </p> <p> The United States and the countries most closely affected by developments in Afghanistan called today for ''broad-based, multiethnic, politically balanced, freely chosen Afghan administration'' to take charge once the Taliban is totally driven from Kabul. </p> <p> The goal, issued in a statement by  a group known here as ''Six plus Two'' -- the United States and Russia plus China, Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, became more urgent tonight with the news that the Taliban had withdrawn from Kabul. The group met with the special United Nations envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, who returned last week after a tour of the region and whose mission the group formally endorsed. </p> <p> The seven-week military campaign in Afghanistan has given the world a stark view of a new American doctrine to make war on the sources of terrorism in the world. But with the defeat of the Taliban perhaps only days away and the hunt for Osama bin Laden intensifying, the force of the American destruction of Afghan targets has sent an unambiguous warning far beyond the war theater to a number of nations that continue to provide bases and training to terrorist groups. The warning is: this could happen to you. </p> <p> Yet how President Bush takes the war campaign from phase one in Afghanistan to phase two against Al Qaeda and other ''global reach'' terrorist groups in dozens of other countries remains an unsettled and, in some quarters, an unsettling question. </p> <p> Given their own history of Soviet and Chechnyan terror, the four Moscow theater artists who are quoted in the article above were asked to describe their reactions to the attacks on Sept. 11. </p> <p> ALEKSANDR GALIN -- Watching the television coverage, my thoughts were of family and friends. I immediately called New York. The line was busy. It seemed as if the entire city of Moscow was calling the American continent. In truth, the entire world was busy dialing American numbers. </p> <p> Hundreds of Muscovites came to the United States Embassy and lighted candles. Some carried flowers. The people with tiny candle lights in their hands were the people of the United World. Those who masterminded and executed the terrible crime were hiding in caves. Unable to find their place in the 21st century present, and attracted to the treachery and brute force of the Middle Ages, they had escaped to the medieval past. </p> <p> The Iranians were the first to arrive. Just a day after Northern Alliance forces swept into Kabul, a small group of Iranian diplomats turned up at their abandoned embassy compound in downtown Kabul. </p> <p> Bitter foes of the Taliban, the Iranians were eager to firm up ties -- and wield influence -- with the new power in Kabul. </p> <p> Czechoslovakia's last Communist Party boss and a top aide were indicted today on charges that they collaborated with Soviet invaders in 1968, the latest in a series of prosecutions of top Communist officials. </p> <p> Milos Jakes, who was the leader of Czechoslovakia's Communists as they lost power in 1989, and Jozef Lenart, a former Communist-era prime minister, are charged with treason and trying to subvert the republic. </p> <p> Next year, unless President Bush has a drastic change of heart, the United States will enlarge the American-led military alliance in Europe by as many as seven countries and extend its boundary to within an hour's tank drive of St. Petersburg. This may seem like an awfully ungrateful way to treat our new friend Russia, so quick to our side after Sept. 11, but the terror attacks have actually made this enlargement of the NATO family more right than ever. </p> <p> In fact, if he is not too distracted by fighting a war abroad and shredding civil liberties at home, Mr. Bush has a chance to accomplish three grand purposes in a single feat of political choreography: consolidating the gains of free-market democracy, drawing Russia closer to Europe, and rejuvenating our most important alliance. </p> <p> Negotiations on a future government for Afghanistan stalled today, after the leader of the Northern Alliance, in Kabul, refused to permit his delegation to submit names of candidates for an interim administration. </p> <p> At a news conference in Kabul, the leader,  Burhanuddin Rabbani, also questioned the  point of the talks in Bonn, saying any new temporary government could wait a month or two for elections. He also said that the former monarch, Mohammad Zahir Shah, should be given no special role, and that any international security force should be limited to some 200 members. </p> <p> Four Afghan factions signed a pact today creating a broad-based interim government for post-Taliban Afghanistan after more than 20 years of rivalry and warfare causing millions of deaths. </p> <p> The new government, which is to take power in Kabul on Dec. 22 for up to six months, will be headed by Hamid Karzai, a 46-year-old tribal leader currently fighting the Taliban in southern Afghanistan. </p> <p> Anna Politkovskaya doesn't think of herself as a war reporter. When colleagues all over the world rushed this fall to cover the war in Afghanistan, she wasn't even tempted. ''I looked inside myself, and I understood I had no desire to go,'' she said during a recent visit to New York. </p> <p> And yet, for the last two years, Ms. Politkovskaya, who writes for the Russian weekly newspaper Novaya Gazeta, has been in the thick of a war, the latest one waged by Russia in the southern region of Chechnya. Often she has been a solitary witness to a conflict in which there is no victory and no defeat, just a steady stream of misery and death, brutality and betrayal. </p> <p> When President Bush stepped into the Rose Garden on Thursday morning, he did far more than announce America's exit from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. He buried an entire era of arms control. </p> <p> Whether it deserved to die, or was killed off prematurely, will be debated endlessly by ideologues and experts who have sharply different views about the wisdom of walking away from accords that some argue have helped prevent nuclear war for almost 30 years. </p> <p> But the most interesting arguments in Washington, Moscow and Beijing this week are less about the wisdom of what Mr. Bush did than about what comes next. For while nuclear confrontation between superpowers seems more unlikely than ever, the probability of nuclear, biological or chemical calamity delivered by stray missile, cargo ship or mail seems greater than ever. </p> <p> And that requires a very different kind of arms control, taking forms Mr. Bush has already begun to consider. ''Clearly we are not against all arms treaties,'' the president's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, said several months ago, ticking off a short list of accords Mr. Bush thinks are a good idea, chiefly the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. ''But the threats have changed and with them the definition of our interests has to be adjusted.'' </p> <p> Gone forever, in the Bush view, is the age in which American negotiators and their Russian counterparts haggled for months or years over multiple warheads and megatonnage, throw-weights and basing modes. Mr. Bush recently recalled how, in years past, watching television news meant ''seeing that people would sit at tables for hours and hours and hours trying to reach reduced levels of nuclear armament.'' </p> <p> It is a waste of time, the president argues. But the deeper problem for Mr. Bush is that he wants freedom -- freedom to test new defensive technologies, freedom to cut America's offensive arsenal to the minimum levels he considers safe for Americans, without regard for what other countries think. </p> <p> The ABM Treaty was all about constraints, and that is why it became a lightning rod for conservatives and for proponents of missile defenses. They knew there was no way to test, much less deploy, an effective missile defense system without violating its terms. But only when relations with Russia warmed over the past few years did those who supported keeping the old structure in place begin to concede Mr. Bush's point that the treaty is a ''relic'' born of a bygone era of confrontation. </p> <p> ''The problem isn't Russia and hasn't been for a long time,'' said James Steinberg, President Bill Clinton's deputy national security adviser. ''Everyone hopes that one day Russia and its nuclear arsenal will be viewed the way we view Britain's or France's. But we're not there yet, and so many of the arguments are about what kind of transitional arrangements we need.'' </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin told the Russian people on television on Thursday that the demise of the ABM Treaty is not likely to change the strategic balance between Russia and the United States. He said he plans to retain 1,500 to 2,200 nuclear missiles -- about the numbers Mr. Bush announced last month for the American arsenal -- which is enough to overwhelm any missile defenses now on the drawing board. </p> <p> The mutual reduction is also a significant advantage for Mr. Putin, because Russia cannot afford to sustain a large arsenal. SeniorRussian officials have declared the ABM Treaty ''strategically irrelevant.'' </p> <p> In short, Russia is the easier part of the equation. The far harder issues -- arguably more difficult now that Mr. Bush has shown his willingness to scuttle a treaty -- involve keeping the lid on established nuclear powers like China and new nuclear ones like Pakistan. China has complained about the American plans to build missile defenses and warned it would build up its nuclear stockpile in response. It is feared that Pakistan's stockpiles could fall into the hands of disgruntled military officers or Islamic fundamentalists with ties to Al Qaeda. </p> <p> And then there are concerns about  countries like Iraq or North Korea, or nuclear-armed terrorists, who dream of delivering nuclear weapons that arrive with no return address. </p> <p> The very existence of the ABM Treaty for the past 29 years meant that China did not have to worry that either Washington or Moscow would construct a missile defense system that would neutralize its minimal force of 20 or so intercontinental ballistic missiles. Long before Mr. Bush came to office, China said it planned to ''modernize'' that force, meaning it would slowly become bigger and more accurate. </p> <p> But now that Mr. Bush is free to build missile defenses, China is likely to speed up that effort -- or so the American intelligence community warned a year ago. ''That's the real problem here,'' said Senator Joseph R. Biden, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ''China will speed up. And I just saw the Indian ambassador, who nodded and said that would put pressure for India to do the same. And then, of course, the Pakistanis match the Indians. Pretty soon, you've started another arms race.'' </p> <p> Perhaps with that in mind, Mr. Bush called President Jiang Zemin of China on Thursday and offered to start up broad strategic talks. That doesn't mean talks on a treaty, the administration says, but on making sure each country understands the other. </p> <p> ''It's about a lot more than offensive reductions on our part, and on what they have said for a long time will be a build-up on their part,'' said Richard L. Armitage, the deputy secretary of state, in an interview today. ''It'll be a bit on missile defenses, some on conventional weapons, some about not doing things that heighten tensions with Taiwan.'' </p> <p> Pakistan represents a different kind of problem. It has never signed a major nuclear treaty, including the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It has always kept out international inspectors. Pakistani officials say that just as Mr. Bush wants freedom to test his defense systems, they want freedom to test and build their nuclear answer to India's arsenal. </p> <p> Mr. Armitage said today that the administration's goals with Pakistan were basic. ''We're a long way from talking'' about the nonproliferation treaty, he said. ''We are interested in making sure their nuclear programs are secure, that their materials are properly stored, among other things.'' </p> <p> While Mr. Armitage was too diplomatic to say so, those talks have become particularly urgent since the Central Intelligence Agency began identifying Pakistani nuclear scientists of dubious loyalties. And it means that the United States is counting on its ability to pressure Pakistan politically, rather than fitting it into a treaty framework. </p> <p> Then come Iraq and North Korea, where Mr. Bush demands that nuclear inspectors must be allowed free rein. So far, both countries have refused. And that may set up the true post-arms control, post-Sept. 11 confrontation: Dealing diplomatically, and perhaps militarily, with countries that could supply or launch nuclear weapons long before Mr. Bush's missile defenses are ready. </p> <p> The Christmas tree had been hacked from the grounds outside the shattered front door. The angel on top was made from a roll of toilet paper. The eggnog was a mix of mashed banana, powdered milk, water and a dash of spice. The young armed man who offered it, to his credit, admitted that it did not taste very good. </p> <p> It was Christmas Eve in the American Embassy here and the marines were playing host with their usual insistence on ceremony and their flair for making do. Outside, some paced in the shadows with rifles at the ready and grenades in their vests. Inside, the rest bowed their heads and waited as the senior enlisted man said grace. </p> <p> After nearly a year of threatening to end programs aimed at helping Russia stop the spread of nuclear weapons, the White House announced today that it remained committed to an effort to help Russia dispose of hundreds of tons of military plutonium. </p> <p> The Bush administration, its concerns about the availability of nuclear weapons heightened since Sept. 11, said it would also continue a program to reduce the dependence of some Russian cities on nuclear weapons development and to provide alternative jobs for nuclear scientists. </p> <p> The 19 nations of NATO pledged today to build a closer relationship with Russia. They also acknowledged that the alliance must undergo a significant transformation because terrorism -- and fear of it -- had undermined conventional military doctrine and the preparedness of forces to fight unconventional enemies. </p> <p> With reports circulating of a split over how deeply Moscow should be allowed into NATO's decision-making, foreign ministers abandoned their previous arrangements for consulting with Russia and promised to bring its leaders into the innermost councils in a number of situations, including the fight against terror. </p> <p> Declaring that the war on terrorism will not end in Afghanistan, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld today urged America's NATO allies to shift their focus and resources to fighting terror around the world. </p> <p> ''The only way to deal with a terrorist network that is global is to go after it where it is,'' said Mr. Rumsfeld, fresh from a trip into Afghanistan on Sunday. He added that the alliance should ''prepare now for the next war.'' </p> <p> Grigory Pasko, the defendant in one of Russia's longest-running and most celebrated treason cases, was reported today to have given a bitter and defiant closing statement to a Vladivostok judge in his second trial, assailing the evidence against him as a string of officially approved fabrications. </p> <p> His precise words were not available, because his five-month trial, like the seven-month one that preceded it, was conducted in secret. </p> <p> A Russian military helicopter carrying two generals, three senior officers and their security detail exploded in midair today and crashed in Chechnya, the second time in four months that Moscow has suffered a major loss of top commanders in the rebellious territory. </p> <p> As many as 14 passengers and crew members were killed, Russian military officials said tonight. Among the dead were the deputy interior minister, Gen. Mikhail Rudchenko, who oversaw Interior Ministry forces in Russia's southern administrative region that includes Chechnya, and his deputy, Gen. Nikolai Goridov. </p> <p> Russia today strongly criticized Bush administration plans to store rather than destroy decommissioned nuclear warheads, suggesting that such plans would undermine the credibility of any new arms control accord aimed at eliminating thousands of nuclear weapons. </p> <p> The spokesman for Russia's Foreign Ministry, Aleksandr Yakovenko, said in a short but pointed statement, ''We hold that Russian-American agreements on further reductions of the nuclear arsenals must be, first, radical -- down to 1,500-2,200 warheads; second, verifiable; and third, irreversible so that strategic defensive arms will be reduced not only 'on paper.' '' </p> <p> Iran purchased American-built Stinger antiaircraft missiles in Afghanistan in 1994 and turned them over to a Lebanese-based terrorist organization, but the missiles proved to be defective, according to United States intelligence reports. </p> <p> Iranian agents then conducted further negotiations in Afghanistan for additional Stinger missiles, according to another intelligence report. It is not known whether the Iranians were able to buy any more of the advanced shoulder-fired weapons. </p> <p> There is speculation now about whether President Bush will visit Afghanistan once the American bombing campaign ceases and the new government is established in Kabul. If he does go, he will not be the first American president to make the journey. On Dec. 9, 1959, Dwight D. Eisenhower, while on a goodwill mission to Central Asia and the Middle East, made a pilgrimage to Kabul. There, he met with the eager, 45-year-old Afghan king, Mohammad Zahir Shah -- the same king many now would like to see return from exile to reclaim the throne in Kabul. </p> <p> Eisenhower had long been eager to visit that strange and forbidding land. ''It was a boyhood dream of his to see the Khyber Pass and size up how tough their soldiers were,'' Gen. Andrew Goodpaster, who served as Eisenhower's assistant on that trip, recently recalled. On the morning of Dec. 9, Eisenhower, who had been in Karachi to discuss Pakistan's troublesome relationship with India with President Mohammad Ayub Khan, flew from Pakistan to Bagram Airport, 38 miles from Kabul. The flight, as reported by Russell Baker in The Times, was harrowing: as the president's jet swooped across the snow-capped peaks dividing Pakistan from Afghanistan and prepared to land, ''six Soviet MIG-17's flown by Afghan pilots streaked out to escort it in.'' This was no accident: Soviet aid had been pouring into the country since 1955, when Nikita Khrushchev had visited. The Kremlin was eager to give Ike a little reminder that it was in charge in this supposedly neutral nation. This was just the beginning of one of the most curious days of Eisenhower's presidency. </p> <p> The year 2001 was a turning point for Russia, the United States and the world. Not long ago everybody wondered what was in store for mankind in the 21st century. Many expressed doubts that Russian-American relations would retain their key role in world politics. On Sept. 11, all these issues appeared in a completely different light. The barbaric acts of terrorists in New York and Washington were indeed a tragedy of worldwide scale. It is no coincidence that President Vladimir Putin compared them with the Nazi crimes of World War II. </p> <p> Half a century ago Russia and the United States, despite enormous political differences, combined efforts against Nazism. Now we are joined by common democratic values, and it is even more obvious that a struggle against a world threat requires the cooperation of our countries and the entire world community. The defeat of the Taliban is only the beginning of a difficult road. </p> <p> Russia's foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, said today that an American proposal to deploy about 200 military specialists to train and equip Georgian armed forces to fight terrorism ''could further aggravate the situation in the region, which is difficult as it is.'' </p> <p> Mr. Ivanov was responding to reports from Washington that the United States planned the training mission to assist Georgia in rooting out Afghan and Arab extremists, some of them possibly linked to Al Qaeda, from the Pankisi Gorge, northeast of Tbilisi, the capital. </p> <p> About the same time the United States began its war on terrorism last fall in Afghanistan, Russia resumed a harsh campaign of torture, abductions and political killings in Chechnya, Human Rights Watch said today. </p> <p> The Russian operations, involving sweeps through villages and the detention of hundreds, follow a pattern established last summer, which Human Rights Watch has documented in a new report, ''Swept Under: Torture, Forced Disappearances and Extrajudicial Killings During Sweep Operations in Chechnya.'' A separatist rebellion has been simmering in Chechnya, a Muslim region in the Caucasus, for more than a decade. </p> <p> Dozens of Afghan and Arab fighters are hiding in this 40-mile-long slash of rock and forest in the Caucasus Mountains, according to Georgian officials. They say at least some of the new arrivals are plotting terrorist strikes in Russia or seeking to reach Europe and the United States, possibly to mount attacks. </p> <p> Officials from both Russia and the United States have indicated they would like to bring the fight against global terrorism here to the snow-encrusted escarpments northeast of Georgia's capital, Tbilisi. </p> <p> Russia's defense minister, Sergei B. Ivanov, said today that Moscow did not support an extension of the war on terrorism to include Iraq, and he warned the Bush administration to remain within international law, implying that any new attacks should have a mandate from the United Nations. </p> <p> Although Russia considers the American-led war in Afghanistan legitimate, ''any actions taken by the states and international organizations against terrorists, including the use of force, should be based on norms and principles of international law,'' Mr. Ivanov told security officials and experts from more than 40 countries gathered here. </p> <p> Russia's Supreme Court handed another legal victory today to Grigory Pasko, a military journalist fighting a treason conviction, by striking down a Soviet-era edict that barred many servicemen from unapproved contacts with foreigners. </p> <p> The same court the day before had invalidated a 1996 order establishing sweeping categories of military secrecy. Mr. Pasko's lawyer, Ivan Pavlov, said that the rulings, taken together, demolish the claim that his client conspired to commit espionage in the mid-1990's when he helped Japanese journalists document the Russian Navy's mishandling of nuclear waste. </p> <p> Russia signaled its claims to influence in the new, post-Taliban Afghanistan today with a quick visit by the highest Moscow official to set foot here since the Soviet Union withdrew its last troops from the country nearly 13 years ago. </p> <p> The visit by Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov, and his assertion of ''the need for Russia to play an important role'' here, came as attention here and abroad focused increasingly on Afghanistan's need to achieve coherence under a weak central government confronted by a tangle of local, factional and foreign interests. </p> <p> Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said today that the United States expected to meet Russia's demand for a ''legally binding'' agreement on reducing nuclear warheads, whether that takes the form of a treaty approved by Congress or some less formal document, but he left most details unspecified and officials said they were still being worked out. </p> <p> Under skeptical questioning by Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, Secretary Powell also insisted that President Bush's linking of Iraq, Iran and North Korea in an ''axis of evil'' was ''not a rhetorical flourish -- he meant it.'' He said that Iraq's overture to the United Nations to resume talks ''should be a very short discussion,'' because weapons inspectors should immediately be allowed back in that country without conditions. </p> <p> An international team of experts has flown to the former Soviet republic of Georgia to try to recover two highly radioactive objects that were found near a mountainous region controlled by Muslim rebels, officials said yesterday. </p> <p> The objects, cylinders not much larger than cans of string beans, caught the attention of three woodsmen because the snow nearby was melting. The men lugged the surprisingly heavy objects to their campsite for warmth and soon became dizzy and nauseated. A week later, they had radiation burns. All three men are now in a hospital in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, and one is fighting for his life. </p> <p> Just after midcentury, when the great powers vied for influence in Afghanistan with aid, not arms, Americans essentially built this city on the Helmand River. It was a suburban Shangri-La created by corporate colonialism, its showpiece a state-of-the-art public hospital that drew patients from hundreds of miles around. </p> <p> The city anchored what was to be the Tennessee Valley Authority of Afghanistan, a multimillion-dollar American project to use dams and irrigation canals to transform desert into a lush breadbasket. The Americans called it Bost, for the ruins of an ancient city nearby. So many settled here with their families that the Afghans called it ''Little America.'' </p> <p> Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov of Russia warned today that the American proposal in arms reduction talks to ''warehouse'' excess warheads instead of destroying them would not only encourage nuclear proliferation, but could even set off a new kind of arms race. </p> <p> Mr. Ivanov's statement, in written answers to questions from The New York Times, was issued as he flew to Washington for four days of talks on arms control, terrorism and other issues. It underscored the fact that despite hopes of sealing a major arms reduction agreement by late May, when President Bush plans to visit Moscow, the two sides remain at loggerheads as to what arms reduction actually means. </p> <p> American and Afghan officials warned today that pockets of Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters remain in southeastern Afghanistan, along the border with Pakistan, and that new military operations will be needed to defeat them. </p> <p> American commanders at Bagram Air Base, north of Kabul, headquarters for an 11-day battle in the southeastern mountains that ended Wednesday, have eased away from earlier estimates that that battle could prove to be the decisive engagement of the five-month-old war. </p> <p> The leaders of a breakaway region in Georgia said today that they were stepping up their efforts to secede and seek an ''associated'' relationship with Russia after the announcement that the United States plans to help train Georgia's armed forces. </p> <p> The leaders of the region, Abkhazia, fear a stronger Georgian Army might turn against them instead ofcombatting terrorists and criminal gangs that have taken refuge in the Pankisi Gorge, northeast of Tbilisi, the capital. </p> <p> In a preliminary study that takes into account not only nuclear tests in Nevada but also nearly all American and Soviet nuclear tests conducted overseas until they were banned in 1963, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that virtually every person who has lived in the United States since 1951 has been exposed to radioactive fallout. </p> <p> These new findings expand on those from five years ago by the National Cancer Institute that showed that people living in a long, plume-shaped region stretching from Idaho and Montana to the Mississippi River and beyond had a slightly higher risk of developing  thyroid cancer because of the Nevada tests. </p> <p> Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said today that while American and coalition troops were conducting mop-up operations in the Shah-i-Kot Valley and surrounding mountains,  there were still pockets of resistance from Al Qaeda and the Taliban in ''a number of locations'' throughout Afghanistan and just across the border in Pakistan and Iran. </p> <p> ''Coalition forces are for the most part in an exploitation phase, doing the difficult work of searching caves and clearing areas where the battles and fighting has taken place,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said in a briefing this morning. ''Our forces are finding weapons, ammunition, some intelligence information.'' </p> <p> In the North Korean capital, the Russian Embassy's annual spring carnival -- a folksy celebration of song and dance, wine and pancakes -- received a surprise visitor: Kim Jong Il, known in his country as Great Leader. </p> <p> Bringing along a large part of the ruling Korean Workers Party Central Committee, Mr. Kim knew his way around the Soviet-era building; after all, the visit last weekend was his third in 10 weeks. </p> <p> The ranking Democratic and Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have written to the Bush administration demanding that any nuclear arms reductions with Russia be submitted to the Senate as a formal treaty, according to copy of their letter obtained today. </p> <p> Senators Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, and Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, said an agreement on ''significant obligations by the United states regarding deployed U.S. strategic nuclear warheads'' would ''constitute a treaty subject to the advice and consent of the Senate.'' </p> <p> A Russian Army officer who fled the battlefield as Moscow sent military forces into Chechnya in 1999 says that young fascist cadets in his elite airborne unit encouraged soldiers to execute civilians during the assault. </p> <p> The officer, Capt. Andrei Samorodov, a communications specialist in Russia's 21st Airborne Brigade, deserted his posting in November 1999 and moved his wife and two children into a village in the Russian countryside. Later he made his way to Mexico, took a bus to the United States border, forded the Rio Grande near Laredo, Tex., and turned himself in to surprised Border Patrol officers. </p> <p> The former king, Mohammad Zahir Shah, returned to his native land today after nearly 30 years in exile, carrying on his frail shoulders this broken country's long-unrealized hopes for peace. </p> <p> The 87-year-old former monarch ambled down the steps of the Italian military plane that carried him from his exile in Rome, stepping onto the tarmac of an airport whose devastation stands as a symbol of the anarchy that engulfed the country during his many years away. The crowd around him broke into applause, and many of the country's most powerful men bent to kiss his hand. </p> <p> The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has expressed doubt about the Bush administration's $3.8 billion plan to convert nuclear warheads to power-plant fuel, raising questions about whether it will become the nation's principal method of disposing of plutonium once aimed at the Soviet Union. </p> <p> The doubts expressed by the commission, which is independent, appear to bolster the contention of the State of South Carolina that plutonium scheduled to be shipped from Colorado next month may never be converted to fuel at a government plant on the Savannah River. </p> <p> Less than a month from now, under extreme secrecy and high-tech security, a heavily armed convoy of trucks is to begin rolling from Colorado to a government fortress near here along the Savannah River. It will carry the first shipment of 34 tons of weapons-grade plutonium once aimed at the Soviet Union. </p> <p> After it arrives, the plutonium is to be converted to fuel for nuclear power plants. But a number of arms control advocates and Democratic politicians here say a principal purpose of the shipment is to enhance the re-election prospects of Senator Wayne Allard, a Republican from Colorado who is campaigning on his efforts to rid his state of plutonium. </p> <p> With the Middle East engulfed in violence and America talking of attacking Iraq, Europe's skepticism about United States foreign policy is on the rise, and it is clouding this weekend's talks between Prime Minister Tony Blair and President Bush. </p> <p> Britain has scuttled plans to publish an intelligence dossier on Iraq's secret arms programs that it had planned to release on Washington's behalf. And Mr. Blair, traveling to Crawford, Tex. on Friday in his favorite role as the bridge between Europe and the United States, is confronting a gap so wide that it now prevents him from openly backing an American attack on Iraq. </p> <p> Russian officials said today that three Russian citizens are among the Taliban and Al Qaeda captives at the United States Naval Base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. </p> <p> The officials said in Moscow that Russia wanted to extradite the three men and prosecute them in Russia, and were preparing criminal cases against them, the Itar-Tass news agency said. </p> <p> When Umer Gul came home this month after 22 years as a refugee in Pakistan, his tears of joy spoke for the tide of Afghans now returning to a country where many had despaired of ever setting foot again. </p> <p> Standing in the jutting wooden prow of the truck that carried his family up to this village near Jalalabad from Peshawar, the Pakistani frontier city, Mr. Gul was enraptured. </p> <p> Russia's counterintelligence agency said tonight that it had broken an American-run espionage ring that officials said had employed a mind-altering drug in an effort to recruit an expert from a top-secret military plant. </p> <p> Russian television and the Interfax news agency reported that an unidentified female C.I.A. officer working as a midlevel American diplomat had been forced to leave Moscow after the espionage plot, which took aim at Russian weapons projects and military work with former Soviet nations, was foiled. </p> <p> About 20 American soldiers flew to the former Soviet republic of Georgia today, the first of 150 to 200 Special Forces G.I.'s who will train and equip army, border and security personnel there, the Pentagon said. </p> <p> President Bush ordered the $64 million program to assist Georgia in training that nation's feeble military in counterterrorism tactics. The United States is also sending small arms and ammunition, medical gear and radios, officials said. </p> <p> The Russian defense minister, Sergei B. Ivanov, said today that Russia had offered the United States ''a number of new ideas'' on nuclear arms reduction to resolve disagreements in arms talks between the countries. </p> <p> Mr. Ivanov made the comments at a news conference here with Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, who was here today on a stopover during a trip to Central Asia. The two men met for more than two hours. </p> <p> Israeli soldiers and tanks poured into the West Bank on Monday as Palestinians continued attacks and as angry demonstrations spread across the Arab world against Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's all-out campaign against the Palestinians. </p> <p> Early this morning, the Israeli Army attacked the headquarters of Jibril Rajoub, the powerful Palestinian security chief in the West Bank, who had been a crucial ally of the United States after the 1993 Oslo peace talks, and jailed scores of Islamic militants. The building was set on fire. </p> <p> Along this desolate frontier said to be teeming with Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters, the border with Pakistan seems as elusive as the fugitives themselves. </p> <p> From sunrise to dusk, people cross the imaginary line that cuts through the mountains here: nomads with camels, smugglers with wares, young men with guns. </p> <p> The Bush administration has informed Moscow that Washington is curtailing many new disarmament projects because of concern about Russia's compliance with treaties banning chemical and biological weapons, according to senior administration officials. </p> <p> Some existing projects will also lose additional money, they said. </p> <p> Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld plans to visit Afghanistan and other Central Asian nations in coming days, with a stop scheduled in Moscow. ''I do intend to go back and visit Afghanistan and some of the neighboring countries in the period ahead,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said yesterday. In December, Mr. Rumsfeld became the first member of the Bush cabinet to visit Afghanistan since the war on terror began. He stopped at Bagram airfield outside of Kabul to meet the nation's interim leaders and greet American troops. Officials said his travel schedule was not yet final for this trip. </p> <p> More than 50 years after its founding and a decade after the end of the cold war, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization approved an agreement today accepting Russia, the former enemy it was formed to fight, into a new partnership with the allies on terrorism, arms control and international crisis management in a post-Sept. 11 world. </p> <p> ''Together, the countries that spent four decades glowering at each other across the wall of hatred and fear now have the opportunity to transform Euro-Atlantic security for the better,'' the NATO secretary general, Lord Robertson, said at a meeting of foreign ministers here. </p> <p> When the Treaty of Rome was signed in March 1957, laying the groundwork for what is today the European Union, the heads of the six founding nations put their signatures to paper in the august main hall of a palazzo designed by Michelangelo. </p> <p> When the leaders of NATO and Russia meet on Tuesday to sign a treaty of cooperation at an air base just outside the Italian capital, they will do so in a setting that one Rome paper described today as a ''Disneyland for the powerful.'' </p> <p> Security strategy is now becoming globalized, in much the way the world's economy has become globalized. Ever since economies changed from being dependent upon land to being predicated on knowledge and information, the world's political borders have been blurred. </p> <p> Similarly, issues of security are shifting from a world in which nations face certain enemies to one in which threats are of a global nature. From the moment that ballistic missile systems were introduced, ballistic range became a strategic factor no less important than territorial depth. </p> <p> The lower house of Parliament passed legislation today that would offer some young Russian men an alternative to the draft, but only under conditions that liberals and advocates of military reform have called onerous and very possibly dangerous. </p> <p> In a vote that underscored the Russian military's resistance to easing conscription, which is mandatory for all men between the ages of 18 and 27, the lower house voted narrowly to allow conscientious objectors and others who oppose military service on ethnic, moral or religious grounds to apply for alternative service. The legislation passed with only 11 votes more than the minimum of 226 required. </p> <p> The recorded number of small arms around the world rose 16 percent last year, to 639 million, according to a new survey. </p> <p> Civilians owned 377 million of those weapons, including handguns and rifles, according to the study, the Small Arms Survey conducted by the Graduate Institute of International Studies, in Geneva. The school said that number represented a 25 percent jump from the year before but that much of the rise probably reflected improved data-gathering after its first-ever survey last year. </p> <p> In a verdict that outraged Russian journalists, a military court acquitted six men today, five of them army officers, in the murder of Dmitri Kholodov, a journalist investigating corruption in the Russian military in the early 1990's. </p> <p> It was a bitter end to a high-profile investigation that began more than seven years ago, when Mr. Kholodov, a reporter for the popular daily Moskovsky Komsomolets, was killed opening a suitcase he thought contained incriminating documents. Journalists expressed concern about the message that they said the verdict seemed to convey -- that such killings will go unpunished. More broadly, they felt, the verdict revealed Russia's unwillingness to examine internal corruption. </p> <p> One day after the United States formally abandoned the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, Russia responded in curt kind today, saying it was no longer bound by the 1993 accord known as Start II that outlawed multiple-warhead missiles and other especially destabilizing weapons in the two nations' strategic arsenals. </p> <p> Russia's action was the sort of statement that would have induced global seizures a decade ago. This time some experts called it a political gesture, signaling displeasure but little else in a world remade by forces unleashed after the Soviet Union's collapse. </p> <p> A Soviet field test of weaponized smallpox caused an outbreak in 1971 that killed two children and a young woman before health teams disinfected homes, quarantined hundreds of people and administered nearly 50,000 emergency vaccine shots, a new report asserts. </p> <p> The outbreak struck Aralsk, a port on the Aral sea in what was then the Kazakh Republic. The report says a ship doing ecological research sailed too close to a military smallpox test that sent out a deadly plume of germs, infecting a crew member who carried the virus back to the city. </p> <p> As senior American officials prepared to begin a round of arm-twisting in Pakistan and India, ambassadors of those two countries indicated little flexibility today toward ending the standoff in Kashmir. </p> <p> India's ambassador, Lalit Mansingh, said time was running out on diplomacy, a barely veiled threat that military action could follow if Pakistan does not meet India's demands to prevent cross-border attacks by militants in the disputed Kashmir region. </p> <p> After months of negotiations, Japan, Canada and the European members of the Group of 8 agreed at the summit meeting today to spend $10 billion over the next decade to help Russia and other former Soviet states dispose of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, ending a long argument over how closely those countries could monitor the work. </p> <p> The figure will roughly match what the United States spends on similar programs, including the Congressional program to secure and dismantle nuclear weapons and keep former nuclear scientists employed. </p> <p> President Bush has directed his top national security aides to make a doctrine of pre-emptive action against states and terrorist groups trying to develop weapons of mass destruction into the foundation of a new national security strategy, according to senior administration officials drafting the document. </p> <p> Iraq is clearly first on the target list for such action, and already the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Department have stepped up efforts to unseat Saddam Hussein in a last effort to avoid the necessity of a full-scale invasion. </p> <p> The International Atomic Energy Agency said today that virtually any country in the world had the radioactive materials needed to build a ''dirty bomb,'' and that more than 100 of these countries had inadequate controls to prevent their theft. </p> <p> The agency, an arm of the United Nations, said in a news release issued at its headquarters in Vienna that ''orphaned'' radioactive materials -- those outside regulatory control -- were a ''widespread phenomenon'' in the former Soviet Union. </p> <p> Inside a cramped workshop here, a team of restorers are hurrying to repair the ravages of war. On an easel in one corner, a landscape painted by Fyodor Lvov in 1854 shows hardly a scar from the 25 holes torn through it by the shrapnel and falling bricks. </p> <p> Along the workshop's bright, cluttered hall, there is a 19th-century portrait of Grand Prince Konstantin Romanov, another simply titled ''Girl with a Book,'' and one of an aristocratic woman -- all restored to near flawless condition. </p> <p> When the Antiballistic Missile Treaty was signed in 1972, Richard Nixon and Leonid Brezhnev sat side-by-side in Moscow, in an elaborate ceremony meant to show that even cold war enemies could come to an agreement. </p> <p> When it died today at age 30 years and 18 days, the White House issued a four-paragraph statement and the Kremlin shrugged, the absence of ceremony meant to show that the American-Russian partnership could survive a disagreement. </p> <p> On a chalkstone promontory above this hard-working town in northern Israel, people came and went all day today, wiping tears from beneath their sunglasses. </p> <p> The processions were thick with young uniformed soldiers, some with M-16 assault rifles slung over their shoulders. A suicide bomber had killed more than a dozen just like them in an attack on Wednesday. </p> <p> Senators from both parties raised sharp questions today about the effectiveness of the recent Treaty of Moscow, which commits the United States and Russia to deep cuts in their nuclear arsenals over the coming decade but offers no guidelines for achieving the cuts or means of making sure that they have been made. </p> <p> Appearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell parried questions about why the agreement lacked procedures for verifying reductions and did not require the destruction of excess warheads. He also urged the senators not to try to add conditions to the treaty. </p> <p> Russia's war in Chechnya is spilling into the steep green gorges and snow-flecked mountains across its border with Georgia, worsening already tense relations between the two countries. </p> <p> Russian fighter jets and helicopters have repeatedly crossed into Georgian territory in recent weeks, evidently in pursuit of Chechen fighters, according to senior Georgian and European officials. At least twice this month -- on Aug. 3 and Aug. 5 -- Russian aircraft bombed a gorge in Georgia less than two miles from the remote border outpost here in Girevi, Georgian officials said. </p> <p> American anger over Russia's construction of a nuclear power plant in Iran and its plans to build as many as five more soured two days of talks between senior American and Russian officials that were intended to highlight new cooperation in securing the world's energy supply. </p> <p> Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said today that Iran was ''aggressively pursuing nuclear weapons'' and that Russia's construction of a civilian nuclear plant at Bushehr, on the Persian Gulf, supported Iran's efforts. </p> <p> International arms sales to the developing world tumbled steeply last year, reaching the lowest level in eight years, as those nations curtailed weapons purchases because of the global economic downturn, according to a new Congressional study. </p> <p> Global arms sales overall, including weapons deals in developed and developing nations, also dropped significantly last year, to the lowest total since 1997, the report said. </p> <p> More than 100 pounds of nuclear material considered at risk of being stolen or sold for use in producing nuclear weapons was secretly flown today from Serbia to Russia, where it will be processed for use in a commercial power plant, United States officials said. </p> <p> The operation, which was financed by the United States and a private foundation founded by Ted Turner, involved 1,200 Serbian soldiers and scores of international observers, They helped transport more than 5,000 rods of highly enriched uranium from a research reactor near Belgrade to Russia under cloak of night. </p> <p> President Bush signed a temporary waiver on Wednesday that permits millions of dollars to be released to programs aimed at reducing the threat posed by Russian nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. </p> <p> The waiver came as Russian scientists disclosed new information about a suspicious outbreak of smallpox in 1971 that some scientists say was caused by a Soviet biological weapons test on an island in the Aral Sea. At a pox virus conference this week in Lyon, France, Russian scientists said they had destroyed some tissue samples and biological material that the United States had hoped might shed light on the outbreak, which killed two children and a young woman before it was contained. </p> <p> Russia, under pressure from the Bush administration, indicated today for the first time that it was prepared to reconsider plans to continue building nuclear reactors in Iran that American officials fear could be used in a covert program to build nuclear weapons. </p> <p> After a third day of meetings here in Moscow with American officials, the minister of Russia's nuclear energy agency, Aleksandr Y. Rumyantsev, said in a statement that Russia would take into account ''political factors'' before deepening its assistance to Iran, according to a statement released by his ministry. </p> <p> Russia's defense minister, Sergei B. Ivanov, said today that a surface-to-air missile shot down the military transport helicopter that crashed in a minefield in Chechnya last week, killing 118 people. But he also angrily found fault with Russian military commanders and vowed to punish them. </p> <p> ''It is absolutely clear that officers who prepared and conducted the flight blatantly violated instructions,'' Mr. Ivanov said as he announced the findings of a preliminary inquiry into the crash. Their actions, he said, ''were sloppy, slovenly and irresponsible.'' </p> <p> President Bush yesterday offered an eloquent, forceful and overdue call for the U.N. to hold Saddam Hussein accountable. </p> <p> Just one problem: He cited no evidence of any immediate threat, no reason that invading Iraq is any more urgent today than it was in, say, 2000, when Mr. Bush as a candidate huffed and puffed about Saddam but never shared with voters any plans for an invasion. </p> <p> The United States made rapid headway today toward persuading the Security Council to confront Iraq, as Russia hardened its position against Baghdad and the European Union supported a new resolution to force the return of weapons inspectors. </p> <p> One day after President Bush told the General Assembly to enforce the United Nations resolutions on Iraq, Russia's foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, warned that Baghdad would face ''consequences'' for failing to cooperate with Security Council resolutions. </p> <p> When construction workers excavating an old Soviet military base for roads and apartments unearthed the first of their grisly discoveries last fall, the conclusion was obvious: here lay the handiwork of Stalinist death squads that spread terror throughout Lithuania in the 1940's and 1950's. </p> <p> Then they found the buttons. </p> <p> The Iraqi foreign minister, Naji Sabri alHadithi, stopped here briefly today, seeking renewed support from a generally sympathetic Kremlin against the threat of an American effort to remove Saddam Hussein from power. He got it, but not as unambiguously as he might have liked. </p> <p> After meeting with Mr. Sabri al-Hadithi, the Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, at a news conference with the Iraqi, repeated the Kremlin's position that military action against Iraq ''would seriously undermine the already difficult situation in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East'' and make prospects for a permanent settlement of the region's problems even more remote. </p> <p> The Bush administration has drafted a stringent plan for arms inspections that provides for unrestricted access to all sites in Iraq, including Saddam Hussein's presidential compounds and palaces, and authorizes the use of military force if Baghdad interferes, according to European and American officials. </p> <p> The essence of the plan, which American and British officials are presenting to France, Russia and China, the other veto-bearing members of the United Nations Security Council, is to declare that Iraq is already violating its obligations to the United Nations and to put the onus on Saddam Hussein to comply. </p> <p> On Friday, the Bush administration will publish its first comprehensive rationale for shifting American military strategy toward pre-emptive action against hostile states and terrorist groups developing weapons of mass destruction. The strategy document will also state, for the first time, that the United States will never allow its military supremacy to be challenged the way it was during the cold war. </p> <p> In the 33-page document, Mr. Bush also seeks to answer the critics of growing American muscle-flexing by insisting that the United States will exploit its military and economic power to encourage ''free and open societies,'' rather than seek ''unilateral advantage.'' It calls this union of values and national interests ''a distinctly American internationalism.'' [Excerpts, Page A14.] </p> <p> Just five days ago, President Bush's strong appeal to the United Nations for collective action on Iraq allayed world suspicion that the United States was a go-it-alone superpower bent on war and forged a broad consensus that Iraq must give up any weapons of mass destruction or face the consequences. </p> <p> Now Iraq's sudden offer to readmit international weapons inspectors has turned the world again, and left Mr. Bush scrambling with mixed success to press his case for disarming Iraq and dislodging Saddam Hussein as the next milestone in his campaign against terrorism. </p> <p> The United States insisted here today on keeping up the pressure on Iraq with a tough new Security Council resolution, while Russia, France, China and the Arab nations said Iraq's decision to allow the return of international weapons inspectors was enough to hold off stronger action for the time being. </p> <p> The very visible rift here exposed core differences between the United States and other major countries at the United Nations, which contended that the weapons inspectors should be given time to determine whether Iraq is producing prohibited weapons. The Bush administration had little faith that inspections would ensure Iraq's disarmament and pressed ahead for a Security Council measure that could authorize an eventual military attack against the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein. </p> <p> A Russian helicopter gunship crashed in Chechnya today, evidently shot down by Chechen fighters, the Ministry of Defense said. The helicopter's two pilots were killed. </p> <p> The attack came less than two weeks after a massive transport helicopter carrying 147 passengers and crew members crashed near the main Russian military base in Chechnya, killing 118. </p> <p> President Bush said today that he would seek approval from Congress before taking action against Iraq, as the White House opened a campaign to persuade lawmakers, reluctant allies and the public that Saddam Hussein poses a grave danger to the United States and the world. </p> <p> Leaders of the House and Senate who were briefed on the president's position today said they were pleased to be consulted, but that neither the president nor his Defense Secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld, had presented any new evidence that the threat from Mr. Hussein was imminent. After Mr. Bush met this morning at the White House with a bipartisan group of Congressional leaders, Mr. Rumsfeld and Gen. Richard B. Myers, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, spoke to senators in a closed meeting on Capitol Hill. </p> <p> President Bush wisely warns of the danger posed by a nuclear-armed Iraq, but he remains unevenly engaged in other efforts that would stem the spread of nuclear weapons. Saddam Hussein's nuclear potential has been repeatedly cited by the administration as the one unassailable reason why the American people should support an invasion of Iraq. Yet ours is a dangerous stance: If we remove the threat of Saddam Hussein while leaving the rest of our nonproliferation policy unchanged, we will achieve only a marginal improvement in our security against nuclear terror. To make an invasion of Iraq worthwhile, a new investment in nuclear security is urgently needed. </p> <p> Leading experts and many in the intelligence community agree that Saddam Hussein still needs several years to produce enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear bomb. Thus, when Vice President Dick Cheney warned that Iraq could quickly obtain nuclear weapons, he could only have been referring to one thing: Iraq might acquire the crucial fissile material it needs abroad, through theft or on the black market. </p> <p> Russian forces battled a large group of Chechen fighters and foreign mercenaries for a third day today in the rugged mountains east of this village in the southern Republic of Ingushetia. </p> <p> The fighting began here on Thursday morning, when Russian military and security troops intercepted the rebels -- about 200 of them, one commander estimated today -- as they tried to cross the mountains into Chechnya. The separatist Chechnya republic has been mired in three years of war. </p> <p> Iraq's rejection of any new United Nations resolution that toughens the terms of disarmament appeared calculated to widen the gap dividing the United States and Britain from the other big powers at the United Nations as they were struggling to find a common approach to confront Saddam Hussein. </p> <p> But if it stands as Iraq's last word, this refusal could also mark the beginning of the transition from diplomacy to war in the Persian Gulf, as President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair were already wheeling their military forces to higher states of readiness. </p> <p> Iraq today rejected a proposal by the United States and Britain for a Security Council resolution imposing tough weapons inspections, saying that it would not accept any new rules for the work of United Nations inspectors. </p> <p> Diplomats from Washington and London shuttled to Moscow and Beijing today after consulting in Paris, trying to overcome strong objections to the draft resolution among the other three permanent, veto-bearing members of the Security Council. The proposal gives Iraq 30 days to make full disclosure of its weapons of mass destruction and provides for unfettered inspections, authorizing a military attack if Baghdad does not comply. </p> <p> Russia punished several senior military commanders today for lapses that contributed to the crash of a military helicopter in Chechnya on Aug. 19, which killed 119 soldiers and civilians. </p> <p> Moving quickly to assign blame for the crash, the single worst loss of Russian lives in the second Chechen war, Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov announced that he had forced the resignation of the general in charge of army aviation and reprimanded at least four other generals, Russian television reported. </p> <p> Dino Brugioni had spent decades poring over every detail from the spy plane photographs of Soviet missiles whose discovery here, 40 years ago this weekend, brought the superpowers to the brink of nuclear holocaust. But today the former Central Intelligence Agency officer learned a few things that had eluded even his careful eye, thanks to none other than Gen. Anatoly Gribkov, who was the Soviet officer who supervised the construction of missile bases in Cuba in 1962. </p> <p> More like old colleagues than former adversaries, the two men stood this morning in front of an abandoned bunker, discussing roads, cables and missile locations. Their exchanges contained more shop talk than sharp words. </p> <p> In a tense three-way contest in the Security Council, the United States pressed today for rapid approval of its tough draft resolution to disarm Iraq while France and Russia presented their own informal texts designed to moderate the threat of military attack. </p> <p> American diplomats, further stepping up the pressure on reluctant allies, put the Council on notice today that the United States might call for a vote on its draft at any time. </p> <p> The first round of Iraq negotiations including both permanent and rotating Security Council members ended today without threats from France, Russia or China to use their veto or moves to confront Washington with competing resolutions. </p> <p> But the 15 Council nations remained divided by as little, or as much, as two words: ''material breach.'' </p> <p> Japan will stop financing two nuclear reactors in North Korea and suspend talks on normalizing relations if there is no progress on ending the North's clandestine nuclear weapons program, Japan's lead negotiator said today. </p> <p> ''Of course the negotiations would halt,'' the official, Katsunari Suzuki, told Japanese reporters. If Japan determined that North Korea ''is carrying out nuclear development, then we must suspend at a minimum, and in certain cases, must think about terminating it,'' he added. </p> <p> The United States presented a slightly revised draft resolution on Iraq to the four other permanent members of the Security Council today, but it did not reach agreement with France and Russia, diplomats said. </p> <p> The draft, presented by Ambassador John D. Negroponte, acknowledged that the Security Council could hold another round of debate after weapons inspectors returned to Iraq and issued a negative report. But Washington will not agree to any language that would block it from taking action on its own, American officials said. </p> <p> Following are excerpts from statements yesterday by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, and by Israel and the Palestinians, on ''The Situation Between Iraq and Kuwait,'' as transcribed by The New York Times: </p> <p> Russia  Sergey V. Lavrov  Ambassador </p> <p> The issue is not how many resolutions or do we need any resolutions. That diverts attention from the crux of the matter. We believe that the crux of the matter is the following: If we're all sincerely interested in the non-renewal of W.M.D. [weapons of mass destruction] programs in Iraq, then what's the remaining issue? What do we expect? What are waiting for? The inspectors can travel tomorrow, as early as tomorrow. And Iraq knows that it must fully and scrupulously cooperate with the inspectors. </p> <p> American intelligence officials have concluded that Pakistan, a vital ally since last year's terrorist attacks, was a major supplier of critical equipment for North Korea's newly revealed clandestine nuclear weapons program, current and former senior American officials said today. </p> <p> The equipment, which may include gas centrifuges used to create weapons-grade uranium, appears to have been part of a barter deal beginning in the late 1990's in which North Korea supplied Pakistan with missiles it could use to counter India's nuclear arsenal, the officials said. </p> <p> The United States formally presented the full Security Council today with a draft resolution that includes a threat of military action against Iraq, sharply increasing the pressure on France, Russia and China to agree to a tough measure to force Baghdad to disarm. </p> <p> The administration's step followed six weeks of wrangling among the five veto-bearing members of the Council that did not yield agreement on linking a proposal for tough weapons inspections in Iraq with a threat of military force to back them up. </p> <p> Under Secretary of State John R. Bolton briefed Russian officials for a second day today on American intelligence evidence that North Korea has an active nuclear weapons program. Russian officials, who indicated on Monday that the initial evidence fell short of proof, were silent after today's presentation. </p> <p> But it was not clear whether that silence signaled continued skepticism or Russian agreement that the program -- which North Korea has admitted to the United States -- must face united opposition, as the White House has urged. </p> <p> In intense negotiations, the United States and Britain pressed the other three permanent members of the Security Council today to accept a draft resolution on Iraq that includes no explicit authorization of military action but leaves the way open for Washington to go to war. </p> <p> After the United States presented a revised draft on Monday, the permanent members, who hold veto power, met twice today for discussions. Council diplomats said the talks were moving forward, but Washington continued to face resistance from France and Russia to its bid for one resolution that would provide the minimum legal foundation for an American attack on Iraq. </p> <p> Hours after Iraq agreed with United Nations officials that weapons inspectors could return in two weeks, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said tonight that any search of Saddam Hussein's arsenals should be delayed until the Security Council approves a ''new, strong, tough resolution'' setting terms. </p> <p> ''We will not be satisfied with Iraqi half-truths or Iraqi compromises or Iraqi efforts to get us back into the same swamp that they took the United Nations into'' in the past, Secretary Powell said at a hastily called news conference at the State Department as the Bush administration scrambled to salvage its push for a new United Nations resolution. </p> <p> A deputy oil minister from Iraq will come to Moscow on Wednesday for a two-day lobbying effort with Russia, as it decides how to respond to the Bush administration's proposed resolution on Iraqi weapons. </p> <p> The deputy minister, Husein al-Hasidi, will ''meet with his colleagues in Russia and with representatives of Russian oil companies to increase cooperation over oil in the framework of the U.N. program,'' said Abbas Khalaf Kunfuth, the Iraqi ambassador to Russia. The visit comes as Russian and American oil executives met in Houston. </p> <p> An independent commission to investigate the intelligence mistakes before the Sept. 11 attacks is needed for one simple reason: intelligence agencies are able to use the secrecy that cloaks their operations to conceal their failings. </p> <p> All government bureaucracies are reluctant to admit error, but it is so much easier for the intelligence agencies to avoid exposure. My own recent unpleasant experience with the Central Intelligence Agency is a case in point. </p> <p> The governments of Britain, Australia, Denmark and several other nations said today that they were strongly considering formal requests from the United States to join a military coalition against Iraq, if weapons inspections fail. </p> <p> The countries are among more than 50 nations that American diplomats have been contacting this week in foreign capitals and at the NATO summit meeting in Prague to discuss participating either in an invasion or postwar reconstruction effort in Iraq, administration officials said. </p> <p> Russia's defense minister, Sergei Ivanov, announced a new crackdown on Chechen militants today to thwart ''new acts of terror'' planned for the region, but he had barely spoken before guerrillas shot down a Russian MI-8 helicopter near Grozny, Chechnya's capital, killing nine soldiers. </p> <p> It was the fifth Russian military copter downed in 10 weeks in Chechnya and surrounding areas, and it raised further questions about the extent of Russian military control in an area where its political foothold is already in serious question. </p> <p> The Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution today that President Bush called a ''final test'' of Saddam Hussein's willingness to disarm, saying the Iraqi president's response must be ''prompt and unconditional, or he will face the severest consequences.'' </p> <p> ''Any act of delay or defiance will be an additional breach of Iraq's international obligations, and a clear signal that the Iraqi regime has once again abandoned the path of voluntary compliance,'' Mr. Bush said in the White House Rose Garden. </p> <p> Seven long weeks into negotiations in the Security Council over a resolution to disarm Iraq, there has been a shift this week toward the United States and British draft proposal for aggressive weapons inspections backed by a clear threat of war, according to Council diplomats representing the United States and some nonpermanent members. </p> <p> France and Russia, both permanent members, are still demanding a second vote based on United Nations arms inspections before authorizing military force. But indications from the two chief United Nations weapons inspectors that they are comfortable with the strong inspections plan proposed in the draft helped persuade nonpermanent Council nations that the proposal was not far off the mark. </p> <p> Figures move like shadows through the early evening fog at the Sputnik refugee camp, giving wide berth to a sudden new set of neighbors -- about 50 Russian soldiers in tents, with a tank and an armored vehicle. </p> <p> Sputnik's refugees -- 5,445 Chechens who lost their homes in three years of war in neighboring Chechnya -- say they feel watched. The Russian authorities say the soldiers are there to protect them from the rebel fighters they suspect hide among the refugees. </p> <p> When the sky above the Khankala military base lit up with the explosion of a gunned-down helicopter on Nov. 3, Asya Dazayeva, a slender mother of four who works in a kiosk near the base, knew there would be trouble. </p> <p> She ran to her house several blocks away on Khankalskaya Street to protect her children, including her deaf teenage son. Soon after, soldiers banged on her door. Gunfire roared almost constantly for more than six hours, until after midnight. </p> <p> American intelligence and defense officials have concluded that Russia -- one of the Bush administration's most important allies in the campaign against terrorism -- supplied Iran with much of the equipment and expertise it used to build two new facilities that appear to American intelligence agencies to be part of a nuclear weapons program. </p> <p> The case is the latest example of the Bush administration's growing difficulties with nations that it has hailed as allies in its efforts against Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. </p> <p> The Russian government today angrily condemned a decision by Iraq to cancel a large oil contract with a Russian oil company, calling it a blow to relations between the countries. </p> <p> Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement: ''Such a step can only be interpreted as going against the friendly nature of Russian-Iraqi relations. It evokes bewilderment that it was done at a time when Russia is trying to ease tensions around Iraq.'' </p> <p> While people in most non-Muslim countries continue to view the United States favorably, negative opinions have increased in most nations over the past two years, according to public opinion surveys in 44 countries. </p> <p> The surveys of 38,000 people conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press indicated that, although there is widespread support for the United States-led campaign against terrorism since the Sept. 11 attacks, it was tempered by large minorities or even majorities in many countries who say the Bush administration is ignoring their nations' interests. </p> <p> Iraq said today that it canceled a large oil contract with a Russian oil company because executives from the company had met with the Iraqi opposition-in-exile. </p> <p> Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, said in an interview with The National Post, a Canadian newspaper, that the contract with Lukoil, Russia's largest oil company, had been canceled because it had discussed the fate of a major oil field with opponents of President Saddam Hussein. ''Lukoil went to Washington to get assurances that their contract will be implemented after the removal of the Iraqi regime,'' Mr. Aziz said in the interview published today. ''This is outrageous of them because they signed a contract with us. Such conduct cannot be accepted.'' </p> <p> Russia has begun deploying a squadron of fighter jets, bombers and other aircraft to Kyrgyzstan, expanding its military presence in former Soviet territory in Central Asia after the opening of American bases there last year as part of the war in Afghanistan. </p> <p> The aircraft are the vanguard of a force that will ultimately include more than 20 Russian aircraft and more than 700 troops, Defense Ministry officials here and in Kyrgyzstan said today. </p> <p> In a potentially crucial turn for Russia's most contentious criminal trial, two forensic psychiatrists testified today that a Russian Army colonel, Yuri Budanov, was insane when he strangled an 18-year-old Chechen woman nearly three years ago. </p> <p> The judgment of insanity -- the second such opinion in months -- appeared to pave the way for Col. Budanov's acquittal in a court proceeding that has become a yardstick for Russia's ability or willingness to control rights abuses by its military. </p> <p> The president of Iran said today that his country would continue construction of a Russian-assisted nuclear power plant and that the plant's nuclear waste would be taken to Russia for safekeeping. But American officials said the United States was still concerned that the plant was part of a secret nuclear weapons program. </p> <p> The comments about the plant, which were made by President Mohammad Khatami during a visit to Pakistan, added to American concerns about the nuclear weapons capabilities of Iran and North Korea, two of the three nations that President Bush has called an ''axis of evil.'' The third country is Iraq. </p> <p> President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea said today that pressure and isolation would not persuade North Korea to end its nuclear arms program, pointing up the South's differences with the United States. </p> <p> ''Pressure and isolation have never been successful with Communist countries; Cuba is one example,'' Mr. Kim told his cabinet, in remarks tailored for an American audience. The United States has announced a plan of political and economic pressure against North Korea to try to force it to halt its renewed nuclear arms efforts. </p> <p> The Security Council, acceding to anxious pressure from the United States, voted today to revise a list of goods that must be approved by the United Nations before Iraq can import them. </p> <p> In a sign of fissures in the unity the United States achieved in November with Resolution 1441, which obliged Iraq to cooperate with new weapons inspections, Russia and Syria abstained today. The other 13 Council members voted in favor. </p> <p> President Bush calls him evil and says he is building nuclear bombs. Japanese officials say his missiles are aimed at Tokyo. Human rights groups say he uses concentration camps to stay in power. Even at the movies, James Bond is being tortured by his North Korean soldiers. </p> <p> But to Konstantin Pulikovsky, a rare foreigner who has spent time with North Korea's secretive leader, Kim Jong Il is a fun guy. </p> <p> Iran and Russia signed an agreement today to speed up the completion of a nuclear power plant that the United States fears could help Iran build nuclear weapons, the official Islamic Republic News Agency Reported. </p> <p> They also agreed to set up a commission to examine building another one, and Russia said that for the next 10 years it would provide fuel for the reactor at Bushire in southern Iran. </p> <p> President Bush joined today with envoys from Europe, Russia and the United Nations in a new call for the creation of a Palestinian state in three years. But the administration and its partners remained divided over how quickly to press their plan for such a state on Israel and the Palestinians. </p> <p> European leaders and other planners want the three-year timetable to be formally adopted and published now. The Europeans, including those who support Mr. Bush on Iraq, are openly worried that without a vigorous Middle East peace negotiation under way, a war to oust Saddam Hussein in Baghdad could spread turmoil throughout the Arab world. </p> <p> Russia warned today that President Bush's order to field a limited missile-defense system in 2004 had pushed the venture into ''a destabilizing new phase,'' but here, as in many places, weary shrugs were the dominant response to the American decision, which had long been considered inevitable. </p> <p> Britain said it was ''very seriously'' considering an American request to upgrade its early warning radar network to support the new shield. Denmark was studying a similar request, for use of the Thule base in Greenland, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said today. </p> <p> Iraq abruptly canceled a contract with Russia's largest oil company and two other Russian companies to develop a major Iraqi oil field. </p> <p> Iraq's decision -- announced in a letter to the company, Lukoil, on Monday -- amounted to a rebuff to Russia, one of Baghdad's strongest supporters at a time when the United States is threatening to go to war over what the Bush administration says is President Saddam Hussein's pursuit of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. </p> <p> Last year, politicians opposing an attack on Saddam claimed it would somehow interfere with our global war on Al Qaeda. </p> <p> This year, a new excuse for delay is being advanced: the nuclear threat from North Korean Stalinists is more immediate, and therefore we should seek an accommodation with them before taking on Saddam. </p> <p> In a darkened public meeting hall, Boris Shikhmuradov's face shone from a giant television screen. He spoke the words of his confession haltingly. He wore no expression. His eyes were cast downward. </p> <p> ''We are a criminal group, a mafia,'' Mr. Shikhmuradov said, trance-like. ''Among us there is not one normal person. We are all nobodies. I am not a person capable of running a country. I am a criminal, able only to destroy it.'' </p> <p> President Bush's new approach to North Korea, involving an offer to consider food and fuel aid upon an agreement to dismantle the North's nuclear program, reflects a determination on the part of the administration to see the Korean crisis resolved peacefully and the focus kept on Iraq. </p> <p> With his advisers split on how to handle North Korea -- in an administration prone to ideological divisions on many international issues -- President Bush has been pressed by hard-liners to try to further isolate North Korea and hope that the dictatorship of Kim Jong Il will give in to American demands or collapse. </p> <p> For months, President Bush has pledged not to use food as a weapon against North Korea. But as the confrontation deepens over the North's nuclear weapons program, the United States has continued to withhold the approval of grain shipments sought by relief groups to avert starvation in North Korea. </p> <p> The World Food Program, an arm of the United Nations, says the suspension of food aid by the United States and Japan, and severe cutbacks by South Korea, have meant that, for the first time in years, it will miss its food distribution goals in North Korea this winter ''by a wide margin.'' </p> <p> Iraq tried to mend relations with Russia yesterday by awarding a new oil contract to a Russian company and promising several more in what analysts called a last-ditch effort to gain allies as the Bush administration prepares for military action there. </p> <p> Hussin al-Hadithi, an under secretary at the Iraqi Oil Ministry, signed the contract yesterday in Baghdad with the Russian company Stroitransgaz for an oil field in western Iraq. The Iraqi government also set aside two other small fields for Russian companies, and began talks on a third. Russian officials, including Ivan Matlashov, the first deputy energy minister, attended the signing. </p> <p> Russian intelligence officers secretly placed sophisticated nuclear detection equipment inside North Korea at the request of the Central Intelligence Agency in the 1990's, to assist the United States in tracking the North Korean nuclear weapons program, intelligence officials say. </p> <p> The Russians placed nuclear monitors provided by the C.I.A. inside the Russian Embassy in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, to try to detect telltale signs of activity from the North Korean nuclear weapons program. The C.I.A. trained officers from the S.V.R., the Russian intelligence agency, in the operation of the American equipment, and the Russians then shared their findings with the Americans. </p> <p> The United States, Russia and Europe should do far more to reduce the urgent and ''grave proliferation risks'' from their remaining stockpiles of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, concludes a new report endorsed by a consortium of influential private research centers. </p> <p> Specifically, the report concludes, the United States and its European allies must begin treating Russia as a partner in such efforts rather than as a strategic charity case. </p> <p> Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel today accused European states of bias in favor of the Palestinians, criticizing their role in an American-backed plan for Middle East peace. </p> <p> Mr. Sharon sought to align Israel with the United States and against the three other members of a so-called diplomatic quartet -- the United Nations, the European Union and Russia -- that has drawn up a detailed ''road map'' for peace and a Palestinian state in 2005. </p> <p> For months, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has been the Bush administration's leading advocate of diplomacy, patiently applied, to rally the international community behind a campaign of pressure on Saddam Hussein to cooperate with United Nations inspectors. </p> <p> Today, responding to the United Nations inspectors' report, he sounded more impatient and less diplomatic. </p> <p> Hans Blix, one of the chief United Nations weapons inspectors, gave a broadly negative report today on Iraq's cooperation with two months of inspections, providing support to the Bush administration's campaign to disarm Iraq by force if necessary. </p> <p> ''Iraq appears not to have come to genuine acceptance -- not even today -- of the disarmament which was demanded of it and which it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the world and live in peace,'' Mr. Blix said, summing up a grim 15-page catalog of Iraq's chemical and biological arms programs that provided an exhaustive account of ways in which Saddam Hussein has failed to prove that he has eliminated illegal weapons. [Transcript, Page A10.] </p> <p> Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service today dismissed as false a report in The New York Times on Monday stating that the service had joined forces with the Central Intelligence Agency in the early 1990's to monitor North Korea's nuclear program. </p> <p> The agency's spokesman, Boris Labusov, said in a telephone interview that the agency denied the details of the article, which he said had alleged that ''some deal was struck between the Foreign Intelligence Service of Russia and the C.I.A. of the United States against the interests of the Korean People's Democratic Republic.'' In a separate interview with the Interfax News Agency, Mr. Labusov called the report ''inconsistent with reality.'' </p> <p> Germany will not insist on a second Security Council resolution if there is a new debate on whether to authorize war in Iraq, Gunter Pleuger, the German ambassador to the United Nations, said today. But it believes that weapons inspectors are making progress, he added, and should be given time to do their work. </p> <p> In an interview, Mr. Pleuger, leaning closer to the United States on a contentious issue than to France and several other Council powers, said that a second round of voting in the Council would be ''desirable but not necessary'' if Iraq commits obvious breaches of past resolutions. </p> <p> United Nations weapons inspectors discovered 11 empty chemical warheads today at an ammunition storage depot in southern Iraq, while another team entered the homes of two Iraqi scientists unannounced, carting away documents. </p> <p> The inspectors stumbled on the warheads in a bunker at the Ukhaider Ammunition Storage Area, about 90 miles southwest of Baghdad. The trove included 11 empty 122-millimeter chemical warheads and ''one warhead that requires further evaluation,'' said Hiro Ueki, the spokesman for the inspectors in Baghdad. He did not elaborate. </p> <p> Assistant Secretary of State James A. Kelly began consultations with South Korea's president-elect and other officials today about the nuclear threat from North Korea, as the North Korean government maintained a barrage of bellicose statements. </p> <p> There were other developments in the United States and Russia on Sunday indicating that a diplomatic solution might be a bit closer. Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations who talked with North Korean representatives last week, said he expected low-level talks to begin between the United States and North Korea at the United Nations. And the Russian Foreign Ministry expressed some optimism about a possible settlement of the crisis. </p> <p> While the United States is trying to hurry things along in the debate in the United Nations about Iraq, other members of the Security Council are becoming more determined to take their time. </p> <p> Differing interpretations of the timetable and procedures laid out in Resolution 1441 had been simmering under the surface since its unanimous adoption on Nov. 8 setting up the new round of weapons inspections in Iraq. Now those differences have percolated into view as the United States has made clear it wants to pass judgment on the results of the inspections much sooner than others on the 15-seat Council. </p> <p> A week after its nuclear inspectors were expelled from North Korea, the International Atomic Energy Agency said today that it would give the North Korean government ''one more chance'' to readmit them before referring the dispute to the United Nations Security Council. </p> <p> The agency's board, which includes the United States, Russia, China and 32 other nations, passed a resolution that ''deplores in the strongest terms'' the expulsion of the inspectors and the dismantling of their cameras, which were trained on nuclear sites to record signs of unauthorized activities. </p> <p> After visits by Australian and Russian diplomats to North Korea, and days before the arrival of South Korean and Indonesian envoys, North Korea warned today that other countries ''do not need to poke their nose into'' its nuclear bomb program. </p> <p> ''The only way of solving the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, peacefully and in a most fair way, is for the D.P.R.K. and the U.S. to hold direct and equal negotiations,'' the state news agency said, using the initials of North Korea's formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. </p> <p> Secretary of State Colin L. Powell warned today that if Saddam Hussein was still not cooperating with United Nations inspectors at the end of this week, President Bush would press immediately for consideration of a Security Council resolution authorizing possible use of force against Iraq. </p> <p> Mr. Powell's comments laid out what appeared to be an accelerating timetable in the confrontation with Iraq, even as France, Germany and other members of the Security Council continued to call for more time before considering the use of force. </p> <p> Diplomatic efforts to avert war in Iraq intensified in Europe today, with France and Germany, supported by Russia, collaborating on proposals to give United Nations weapons inspectors more time. </p> <p> France and Germany denied reports that they were working on a secret plan to disarm Iraq while avoiding war, but confirmed they were in talks about strengthening United Nations' weapons inspections based on proposals made by the French last week. </p> <p> When Secretary of State Colin L. Powell goes before the Security Council on Wednesday to discuss Iraq, his appearance will inevitably be contrasted with what was probably the most dramatic event in the Council's history -- the moment the United States showed the world photographic evidence of Soviet missiles in Cuba. </p> <p> On Oct. 22, 1962, charging that the Kremlin was building missile bases on Cuba, the United States imposed a naval blockade around the island. Three days later, the American ambassador to the United Nations, Adlai E. Stevenson, came before the Council to demand that the Soviet Union remove the missiles. When his Soviet counterpart, Valerian A. Zorin, said the United States had no evidence to support its accusations, Stevenson challenged him directly: </p> <p> The rift between the United States and Europe deepened even further today as France, Germany and Russia issued an informal ''memorandum'' calling for at least four more months of weapons inspections in Iraq. The document was released as the United States, Britain and Spain introduced a United Nations Security Council resolution declaring that Baghdad has failed to disarm as required and must face ''serious consequences,'' diplomatic code for war. </p> <p> The memorandum, drafted by the French and circulated at the United Nations today, was supported by the Chinese, French officials said. Senior French officials said Paris did not intend for the document to be treated as a draft Security Council resolution. </p> <p> President Bush's decision to go all out to win a second Security Council endorsement to wage war on Iraq was made primarily to help a friend and ally, Prime Minister Tony Blair, say experts who follow British affairs. But the determined opposition of France, Germany and Russia expose Mr. Bush to the risk of diplomatic embarrassment. </p> <p> ''He has to do it primarily because it is now a necessary action to ease Tony Blair's problems,'' with the torrent of popular domestic opposition to war, said James R. Schlesinger, a former secretary of defense and a member of the Defense Policy Board that advises the Pentagon. ''It is also an indication of our deep and abiding hope in the efficacy of the U.N.,'' Mr. Schlesinger added. </p> <p> The United States, Britain and Spain asked the Security Council today to declare that Iraq had missed its last chance to disarm to avoid a war. But France, Russia and Germany moved to strengthen the United Nations inspections and give Saddam Hussein months more to show that he is complying. </p> <p> The American ambassador to the United Nations, John D. Negroponte, told reporters after the session that he viewed the approach by those three nations with ''deep skepticism,'' and senior Bush administration officials predicted that the outcome would soon be either Mr. Hussein's exile or military action to disarm Iraq and topple his government. </p> <p> A panel of arms experts convened by United Nations weapons inspectors has confirmed that a missile Iraq has developed exceeds range limits set by the Security Council. </p> <p> The panel's conclusion will add fuel to the United States' argument that Iraq is defying Security Council disarmament resolutions, and it is likely to deepen the discord here over whether to go to war against Iraq or allow inspections to continue, as several critical Council nations insist. </p> <p> Twenty years ago this month, I was an aide to Vice President George Bush during another trans-Atlantic crisis. There were demonstrations in European capitals in which America was portrayed as the threat to world peace and the American president was called a warmonger, a ''cowboy'' and worse. Vice President Bush's response in February 1983 may hold some lessons for President Bush in February 2003. </p> <p> Two decades ago the vice president was dispatched to London to calm things down, to hold hands, to remind our European friends and allies that we were still all in this together. What made his trip necessary was the controversy over deployment of nuclear missiles in Europe; several years earlier, the Europeans had requested that the United States place Pershing 2 missiles in Europe to counter Soviet medium-range missiles that were aimed at the Continent. </p> <p> The United States and Britain have decided that their strategy in the United Nations will be to try to persuade 9 of the 15 members of the Security Council to back a new resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq, and then to challenge France, Russia or China to veto the will of the Council's majority, administration officials said today. </p> <p> American and British officials worked today to settle their differences over the resolution's language while refining it to attract the support of other Council members. Administration officials said the talks meant the resolution would not be introduced until next week, possibly on Monday. </p> <p> Pundits and officials in Washington have dubbed Secretary of State Colin Powell's attempt to make a case for war against Iraq in the United Nations Security Council an ''Adlai Stevenson moment.'' </p> <p> I couldn't disagree more. My father was Adlai Stevenson, who in 1962, as President Kennedy's representative to the United Nations, presented the Security Council with incontrovertible proof that the Soviet Union, a nuclear superpower, was installing missiles in Cuba and threatening to upset the world's ''balance of terror.'' </p> <p> Although the Bush administration is not yet assured of the nine votes necessary to win another resolution authorizing war against Iraq, officials see tremendous advantages to having an endorsement from the Security Council, even if it passes with abstentions from France, Russia and China, veto-bearing permanent powers. </p> <p> American officials were encouraged to consider new Council negotiations as they perceived declining support in Europe for France and Germany, the main Council opponents to war. </p> <p> France and Germany closed ranks against the United States today, blocking attempts by NATO to begin military planning for a conflict with Iraq and issuing a joint declaration with Russia calling for intensified weapons inspections as an alternative to war. </p> <p> In a statement issued here, Russia, Germany and France called for a ''substantial strengthening'' of the ''human and technical capabilites'' of the weapons inspectors in Iraq, arguing that the inspections should continue in more vigorous form before war is contemplated. </p> <p> Following are excerpts from a meeting of the United Nations Security Council yesterday after reports by the chief weapons inspectors, as recorded by Federal News Service Inc. Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammed Aldouri, attended as an invited speaker. Translations of Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan's remarks (from the Chinese), Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov's remarks (from the Russian) and Mr. Aldouri's remarks (from the Arabic) are by the United Nations. </p> <p> FOREIGN MINISTER JACK STRAW OF BRITAIN </p> <p> Mr. President, I speak on behalf of a very old country founded -- (laughter) -- founded in 1066 by the French. (Laughter, scattered applause.) Thank you. . . . </p> <p> The Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously endorsed a treaty today that obliges the United States and Russia to cut their strategic nuclear arsenals by two-thirds over the next 10 years, granting President Bush a long-delayed foreign policy victory. </p> <p> The 19-to-0 vote sends the treaty, which was signed by Mr. Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin in Moscow last May, to the Republican-controlled Senate, which is expected to approve it later this month. </p> <p> A Stevenson moment? </p> <p> In many ways, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's presentation today echoed Adlai E. Stevenson's display of photographs of Soviet missile installations in Cuba in 1962. </p> <p> Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, pressing the American case for a possible war to disarm Iraq, today presented photographs, intercepts of conversations between Iraqi military officers and information from defectors aimed at proving that Saddam Hussein poses an imminent danger to the world. </p> <p> Among the evidence presented at the United Nations Security Council were recordings of Iraqis referring to ''nerve agents,'' and to apparent efforts to remove incriminating material before the arrival of United Nations inspectors. Scratchy-sounding voices in Arabic saying, ''We evacuated everything,'' ''Remove,'' and ''Forbidden ammo,'' echoed eerily in a chamber clearly tense over the possibility of war. </p> <p> Following are excerpts from a meeting of the United Nations Security Council yesterday after the address by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, as recorded by Federal News Service Inc. A full transcript is online: nytimes.com/international. </p> <p> FOREIGN MINISTER TANG JIAXUAN OF CHINA -- . . . The inspections have been going on for more than two months now. The two agencies have been working very hard and their work deserves our recognition. It is their view that now they are not in a position to draw conclusions, and they suggested continuing with the inspections. We should respect the views of the two agencies and support the continuation of their work. </p> <p> Leading military equipment makers from around the globe are aggressively promoting their products to India's huge defense market, with its $100 billion in expected spending in the next decade. </p> <p> Scores of companies converged in Bangalore last week for Aero India 2003, a trade show held every two years for aircraft and military companies. They included companies from the United States, Britain, France, Russia and Israel -- countries that dominate the global military supplies trade. American companies had missed the last two shows because of sanctions imposed by President Clinton. Those sanctions have been lifted by President Bush. </p> <p> Plans for more Russian help in maintaining the International Space Station while American space shuttles are grounded are limited by a law that bars direct financial support for the Russian program, NASA officials said today. </p> <p> While negotiations are under way with the Russians, and other partners in the international project, to keep the station functioning and staffed until shuttle flights resume, options are limited because of a law from 2000 that was intended to keep the Russians from helping Iran with rocket technology. </p> <p> The tension that is now rising within the Western alliance, NATO and the U.N. over how to deal with Iraq is deeply disturbing. It raises fears that the postwar security system, which stabilized the world for 50 years, could come unglued if America intervenes alone in Iraq. At the birth of this security system, Secretary of State Dean Acheson wrote a memoir titled ''Present at the Creation.'' Can we deal with Iraq and still ensure that Secretary of State Colin Powell's memoir is not titled ''Present at the Destruction''? </p> <p> Yes, we can -- if we, the Russians, the Chinese and the French all take a deep breath, understand our common interests and pursue them with a little more common sense and a little less bluster. </p> <p> France, offering an alternative to the United States' drive to disarm Iraq by force, circulated a detailed plan today to Security Council nations for extending and strengthening United Nations weapons inspections. </p> <p> With the support of Russia and Germany, France proposed to double and eventually triple the number of inspectors and to increase aerial surveillance flights, building its position in anticipation of a confrontation with the United States at the Council next week. </p> <p> A military transport plane carrying members of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards crashed in southeastern Iran today, killing all 302 people on board, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. </p> <p> Officials said the crash was the worst in the country's history. </p> <p> With an American-led war on Iraq appearing ever more likely, the United States and Britain said today that they would urge the Security Council to vote next week on a new resolution that would give Iraq until March 17 to disarm. But France, Russia and China, which hold veto power, swiftly dismissed the new proposal. </p> <p> The new move to unite the world's deeply divided powers came after the chief United Nations weapons inspectors bluntly if quietly contradicted some American and British assertions about Iraqi violations and drew sharp rebuttals from Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and the British foreign minister, Jack Straw. </p> <p> For the first time, the Bush administration has identified nine senior Iraqi officials, including Saddam Hussein and his two sons, who would be tried for war crimes or crimes against humanity after an American-led attack on Iraq, a senior American official said. </p> <p> The list of names -- compiled, but not published, by American intelligence agencies -- includes members of Mr. Hussein's inner circle who sit atop a hierarchy of 2,000 members of the Iraqi elite. </p> <p> As several American ''big birds'' flew in from the West to airfields in the zone we protect in Iraqi Kurdistan, a freedom fighter turned to a Kurdish friend: ''I have been a pesh merga for 25 years,'' he said. ''I always dreaded the sight of aircraft because they brought death to our people. This is the first time I have seen an air force on our side.'' </p> <p> The transports arriving at the rate of four a day carry U.S. forces as well as loads of weapons to enable Kurds to follow up on our air and missile strikes at Ansar and Qaeda terrorists. Together with the 70,000 Kurdish warriors who call themselves the pesh merga, ''those who face death,'' the U.S. troops being inserted daily are early elements of what will become the northern front. </p> <p> A delegation of the New York-based National Council of Churches met with Russian officials as part of an effort by the council to spread its message against a war with Iraq. Representatives of the ecumenical group, which unites 36 Protestant and Orthodox Christian denominations, have met with Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and Pope John Paul II, as well as French Foreign Ministry officials. </p> <p> Russia's Supreme Court today threw out the verdict in the nation's most contentious criminal trial, ruling that a military court ignored procedure when it absolved a prominent army colonel of responsibility in the strangling of an 18-year-old Chechen woman in March 2000. </p> <p> The ruling means that Col. Yuri Budanov, who had been declared temporarily insane at the time of the killing, will stand trial again before a new judge. It was a stunning victory for the family of the slain woman, Elza Kungayeva, and for critics who have charged that Colonel Budanov's trial was tainted by pressure from the military. </p> <p> The White House said today that the only way to prevent war in Iraq would be to disarm the country and depose Saddam Hussein. </p> <p> At the same time, Russia's foreign minister threatened to veto a United Nations Security Council resolution that says Iraq has missed its last chance of avoiding war. </p> <p> Diplomats who had failed for the last two months to agree on a unified approach to the Iraq crisis met here today, with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Russia offering angry post-mortems on the diplomatic debacle and arguing that the planned American-led invasion to disarm Iraq and oust Saddam Hussein had no basis in international law. </p> <p> Speaking of various Security Council resolutions on the Iraq crisis, Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov of Russia said ''not one of these decisions authorizes the right to use force against Iraq outside the United Nations charter.'' Like his counterparts from France and Germany, he continued to argue that the inspections process had achieved results in disarming Iraq. </p> <p> I have a confession to make. Right after 9/11, I was given a CD by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, which included its rendition of ''The Battle Hymn of the Republic.'' I put it in my car's CD player and played that song over and over, often singing along as I drove. It wasn't only the patriotism it evoked that stirred me, but the sense of national unity. That song was what the choir sang at the close of the memorial service at the National Cathedral right after 9/11. Even though that was such a wrenching moment for our nation, I look back on it now with a certain longing and nostalgia. For it was such a moment of American solidarity, with people rallying to people and everyone rallying to the president. </p> <p> And that is what makes me so sad about this moment. It appears we are on the verge of going to war in a way that will burst all the national solidarity and good will that followed 9/11, within our own country and the world. </p> <p> Images from Iraq flooded the airwaves this week, and damped the market for images that opened here Monday. </p> <p> Some booths capitalized on Iraq. </p> <p> The United States is battling France, Russia and others in Europe over American efforts to try to curb the role of the United Nations in governing and rebuilding a postwar Iraq, and once again Britain, Washington's staunchest ally in the drive toward Baghdad and the diplomatic war that preceded it, is trying to play the role of mediator. </p> <p> The British prime minister, Tony Blair, who arrived here this evening for meetings with President Bush, has said he wants to use this trip to press Washington to accept some kind of United Nations blessing for the occupation, even though the Security Council failed to approve a resolution on the war this month. </p> <p> France and Russia made clear today that they were ready to use their veto power to block passage of a new Security Council resolution authorizing force against Iraq, but Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said the United States would go to war without United Nations backing if necessary. </p> <p> Meeting in Paris, the foreign ministers of France, Russia and Germany issued a statement saying they would not ''let a proposed resolution pass that would authorize the use of force.'' [Text, Page A16.] </p> <p> The declaration issued today by Germany, Russia and France against war in Iraq now -- with its implicit threat of veto -- may go down as the loudest ''No!'' shouted across the Atlantic in a half century or more. </p> <p> The nine-paragraph statement may not have slowed the seemingly inexorable drive by the Bush administration to commence military operations as early as next week. </p> <p> Following is the text of a joint statement by Foreign Ministers Dominique de Villepin of France, Ivan S. Ivanov of Russia and Joschka Fischer of Germany, as translated by the French Foreign Ministry: </p> <p> Our common objective remains the full and effective disarmament of Iraq, in compliance with Resolution 1441. </p> <p> France has promised to veto the U.S.-British-Spanish resolution to end Saddam Hussein's manipulation of the U.N. Two other veto-bearing members of the Security Council, Russia and China, are expected to join in protecting Iraq from being forced to disarm. </p> <p> President Bush has made it clear he will call for the vote that will expose the council as unwilling to protect the world from blackmail by terrorist states with ultimate weapons. </p> <p> Secretary of State Colin L. Powell told a large group of American supporters of Israel tonight that Israel faced ''difficult choices'' in making peace and that as terrorism by Palestinians subsided, Jewish ''settlement activity'' in the West Bank and Gaza must end. </p> <p> Speaking to an annual meeting of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, known as Aipac, Mr. Powell also gave a vigorous defense of the Bush administration's support for a peace plan drafted over the past year by the United States, Russia, the United Nations and the European Union. </p> <p> I never made it higher than corporal, but it doesn't take a military genius to figure out the strategy when you have air supremacy: break the back of the enemy's armor and its infantry before your big ground assault. A month's bombing worked in the last gulf war and a couple of weeks should ''degrade'' the Iraqi Army again. </p> <p> Here is a baker's dozen of my snap judgments about this war: </p> <p> In a sharp rebuff to European allies, Russia and the United Nations, the Bush administration has decided not to put forth a plan for a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians until after the crisis in Iraq is resolved, administration officials say. </p> <p> Negotiations aimed at drafting a three-year-long, step by step ''road map'' leading to the creation of a Palestinian state have been under way between the United States and these partners for nearly a year, but the administration has come under increasing pressure of late to adopt and publish the plan formally as the likelihood of a war with Iraq has risen. </p> <p> ''Relevance'' has become the buzzword of the Iraqi crisis. From the president on down, leading Bush administration officials have declared that if the United Nations, as it approaches the age of 58, cannot decide to make its authority felt on Iraq, it may as well resign itself to being a debating society, albeit one with a $1.45 billion annual budget. </p> <p> Even ardent internationalists worry that the institution finds itself in a lose-lose situation -- ridiculed as a puppet if American pressure forces a reluctant Security Council majority to support a war against Saddam Hussein, or reduced once more to a self-absorbed cipher if France, Russia and Germany lead the Security Council to thumb its nose at the world's superpower. </p> <p> The Senate unanimously approved a treaty with Russia today that requires both countries to reduce their arsenals of deployed strategic nuclear weapons to below 2,200 warheads each over the next 10 years. </p> <p> The pact now goes to President Bush, who planned to sign it, according to the White House. The Russian Parliament has yet to act on the treaty. </p> <p> President Bush prepared the country tonight for possibly imminent military action against Iraq, declaring that Saddam Hussein posed a direct threat to the security of the United States and insisting ''we really don't need anybody's permission'' to defend the United States. </p> <p> He said that only days remained for a diplomatic solution and vowed that he would press for a vote on a new resolution at the United Nations in the next few days, even if it appeared that he could not muster a majority 9 of the 15 votes on the Security Council, and despite a French and Russian threat of veto. A defeat would not deter him, he said, from disarming Mr. Hussein. </p> <p> When President Bush stepped up to his White House lectern tonight, it was the first time in 18 months, and the second time in his presidency, that he had held a prime-time news conference in the classical splendor of the East Room. </p> <p> The timing was no accident: Mr. Bush agreed to the news conference this morning, 24 hours after the French and Russian foreign ministers declared that they were ready to use their vetoes in the United Nations Security Council to stop an American-led attack on Iraq. </p> <p> President Bush's ultimatum to Saddam Hussein drew stinging criticism from France and Germany today, with President Jacques Chirac denouncing the decision to resort to war as illegal and wrongheaded. </p> <p> In Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair delivered an impassioned defense of his alliance with Mr. Bush but faced a major revolt in his Labor Party as Parliament engaged in a daylong debate over going to war with Iraq. </p> <p> The United States lacks a comprehensive plan for protecting the world's supply of nuclear material from terrorists, according to a report issued today by Harvard University researchers. </p> <p> The report, titled ''Controlling Nuclear Warheads and Materials,'' is part of a three-year research project commissioned by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a Washington foundation, to create a report card on nuclear security around the world. </p> <p> A Russian news Web site has published a report claiming that two former top Soviet military officers visited Iraq less than two weeks before the start of war to advise the Iraqi military leadership. </p> <p> The report, posted Wednesday on the www.gazeta.ru Internet site, showed three photographs of the two former Soviet generals receiving an award from Iraq's defense minister, Sultan Hashem Ahmed. </p> <p> Nine days after President Bush presented Congress with the first bill for the war in Iraq, the House and Senate approved the cost tonight, voting to spend nearly $79 billion on the war and related needs for foreign aid and domestic security. The Senate's vote was unanimous; the House vote was 414 to 12. </p> <p> The broad consensus on finding money for the Iraq campaign, however, did not extend to supporting the administration's plans for domestic security and foreign aid. The votes were delayed into the evening by testy debates on aid to Turkey, which was opposed by a vocal group of conservative Republicans in the House, and on Democratic proposals to spend billions more on security aid to states and cities. </p> <p> The two top leaders of Russia's estimated 14 million Muslims split today over whether to proclaim a jihad against the United States in response to the invasion of Iraq. </p> <p> Supreme Mufti Talgat Tadzhuddin, the leader of an Islamic council claiming to represent all Russia, said the council's 29 Islamic departments had voted unanimously by fax early today to declare jihad, or holy war. </p> <p> After weeks of criticism that he had underestimated the difficulty of toppling Saddam Hussein and overpromised in suggesting that American troops would be greeted in Iraq as liberators, Vice President Dick Cheney spoke publicly today for the first time since the start of the war, and in his understated way said: I told you so. </p> <p> The conclusion of the war ''will mark one of the most extraordinary military campaigns ever conducted,'' Mr. Cheney told the American Society of Newspaper Editors conference in New Orleans this morning, while television screens were showing jubilant Iraqis pulling down statues of Mr. Hussein in Baghdad less than three weeks after the start of the American-led offensive. </p> <p> The Security Council today stepped back from a potential standoff over North Korea's withdrawal from the treaty that prohibits it from developing nuclear weapons, as China signaled its openness to ''promote political dialogue'' and the United States eased off its pursuit of a formal statement of condemnation. </p> <p> Both the Chinese and American actions represented discreet pullbacks from earlier positions taken after the International Atomic Energy Agency referred the question of North Korea's nuclear program to the Security Council two months ago. </p> <p> It is almost certain that the toppling yesterday of Saddam Hussein's giant statue in the center of Baghdad will be considered in retrospect as one of the iconic images of the present war in Iraq. As I watched this scene unfolding on television, similar episodes from the not-so-distant yet already faintly hazy past, sprang to my mind. </p> <p> First, of course, there was the 1989 demolition of the Berlin Wall, which for years divided Germany into the socialist East and the capitalist West. Watching that evening unfold on TV, one could feel the almost palpable physical excitement as youthful drunks madly clawed and hammered away at the hated symbol of this enforced division. </p> <p> Nearly two dozen Russian diplomats and journalists, including Russia's ambassador to Iraq, came under attack twice today as they were leaving Baghdad in an automobile convoy, Russian and American officials said. </p> <p> At least five were wounded, and some Russian and Arab broadcast reports tonight said that the Russian ambassador to Iraq, Vladimir Titorenko, was among them. None of the injuries were life-threatening, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said. </p> <p> The clash between American and North Korean negotiators this week reminded me of another push to get rid of nuclear weapons: not the 1994 talks with North Korea, which did not succeed in the end, but those with Ukraine, which did. After months at the table with Russia and the United States, the Ukrainians let their 1,900 warheads go to Russia for destruction. </p> <p> Although no one expected this week's talks to go smoothly, I sometimes hear that the Ukrainian accord is irrelevant to North Korea because it was a cakewalk. But as an architect of the Ukraine accord, I don't remember it that way. At the time, the Ukrainian Parliament was full of deputies who were determined to hold on to the country's leftover Soviet weapons, to protect themselves from Russia. Former Soviet Rocket Forces officers were swearing allegiance to their new country and claiming they could run an independent nuclear arsenal. </p> <p> BY the Bush administration's reckoning last month, the cost of waging the war against Iraq will run about $62 billion. By contrast, the cost of rebuilding that country afterward is estimated at only $3.6 billion. </p> <p> For those who argue that the United States is either being stingy or unrealistic about the postwar costs, administration officials have invoked an analogy of the supply-side economic philosophy that they are using to sell tax cuts at home. </p> <p> In a scathing attack on the Bush administration, the former House speaker, Newt Gingrich, charged today that the State Department under Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was guilty of a ''pattern of diplomatic failure'' that weakened America's standing in the world and was threatening to ''undo the effects of military victory'' in Iraq. </p> <p> Mr. Gingrich's criticism, in a speech on postwar Iraq at the American Enterprise Institute here, brought a tart response from Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman. He said that in every instance cited by Mr. Gingrich, the department ''is here to carry out the president's policy.'' </p> <p> President Bush's national security adviser said today that the American-led alliance had shed ''life and blood'' in the Iraq war and would reserve for itself -- and not the United Nations -- the lead role in creating a new Iraqi government. </p> <p> In declaring that the United Nations would have a secondary role in reconstructing Iraq and leading the country toward eventual elections, the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, seemed certain to fuel the latest trans-Atlantic dispute between the Bush administration and its traditional allies. </p> <p> Administration officials are turning to a gathering of the world's financial ministers to help pay for the rebuilding of Iraq. But they are discovering that without a stamp of approval from the United Nations, they are fighting an uphill battle. </p> <p> While the pleas for aid have been greeted positively, the administration is running into a familiar problem. Foreign institutions and foreign governments say they may need approval from the United Nations Security Council before they give or lend money to Iraq while it is under military occupation. </p> <p> For Poland, these have been heady times. Not since this country liberated itself from Soviet control has it adopted so visible a role on the world stage, or one so defiant of the wishes of its most powerful future partners in the European Union, which Poland is scheduled to join next year. </p> <p> Last week produced the historically arresting spectacle of a Polish defense minister, Jerzy Szmajdzinski, inviting his German counterpart, Peter Struck, to contribute troops to the Polish-led force that the United States foresees guaranteeing security in Iraq. It was an invitation that the Germans summarily, even angrily, dismissed. </p> <p> After months of cold war with the United Nations, the United States put forth a draft resolution last week to give the international body oversight of efforts to rebuild Iraq. Although this might help the United Nations gain back some credibility, Washington's effort was clearly intended as a peace offering to its former ''Old Europe'' allies. While the offer is certainly genuine, it is unlikely to thaw relations with Russia, France, Germany and Turkey. The problem is that the Bush administration, while ostensibly trying to get its traditional friends on board, continues to dissemble about where the train is headed. </p> <p> To understand the problem, one has to consider what the Europeans were presented with in the build-up to war. Beyond polemics and misgivings, the basic problem was that Washington's stated war goals were not logically coherent, and its more intellectually compelling arguments were usually played down or denied. </p> <p> President Bush declared tonight that the military phase of the battle to topple Saddam Hussein's government was ''one victory in a war on terror that began on Sept. 11th, 2001, and still goes on.'' </p> <p> Speaking from the deck of the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln before thousands of uniformed sailors and aviators as the ship approached San Diego Harbor, he argued that by vanquishing Mr. Hussein's government, he had removed ''an ally of Al Qaeda,'' and he vowed to continue to search for banned weapons in Iraq -- a search that so far has been largely unsuccessful -- and to confront any other nations that use such weapons to threaten the United States or could sell them to terrorists. </p> <p> When President Bush travels to St. Petersburg early next month, he will again urge President Vladimir Putin to stop supplying Iran with the means to develop nuclear weapons. Putin will insist, as usual, that his dangerous trade is all for peaceful purposes. </p> <p> Bush will seem to tolerate that. Further, he will pretend to forget the Russian's last-ditch support in the U.N. of Saddam's tyranny. That's what passes for diplomacy. </p> <p> A Palestinian bomber disguised as an Orthodox Jew detonated himself tonight on a crowded bus, killing 16 other people, wounding nearly 100 and dealing another blow to the newly born American-led plan to find peace between Israelis and Palestinians. </p> <p> The bomb exploded in the aisle next to the driver on the 14/A bus on Jaffa Road in central Jerusalem at about 6 p.m. local time, just as the evening rush hour was starting. </p> <p> Where are Iraq's weapons of mass destruction? It's a good question, and unfortunately we don't yet have a good answer. There is hope that the capture of Abid Hamid Mahmoud al-Tikriti, Saddam Hussein's closest aide, will provide the first solid clues. In any event, the mystery will be solved in good time; the search for Iraq's nonconvential weapons program has only just begun. </p> <p> In the meantime, accusations are mounting that the Bush administration made up the whole Iraqi weapons threat to justify an invasion. That is just not the case -- America and its allies had plenty of evidence before the war, and before President Bush took office, indicating that Iraq was retaining its illegal weapons programs. </p> <p> When President Bush and the other Group of 8 leaders gather to discuss the world's problems on Sunday and Monday, they will no doubt be hoping that this trim spa on the shores of Lake Geneva will be the source of something more than just cold bubbling spring water. </p> <p> Their host, President Jacques Chirac of France, will press them to turn their attention from terrorism, Iraq and the Middle East to restarting a process of helping less developed regions of the world, most notably Africa. </p> <p> President Bush's aerobic seven-day, six-nation trip, which ended today with a visit to American troops here, took him from the concentration camp sites of Poland to the czars' palaces of St. Petersburg, a global economic conference in the French Alps and Middle East peacemaking on the edge of the Red Sea. For a president who does not love to travel, the trip was Clintonian -- two countries nearly every day and a new bed to sleep in most nights. </p> <p> By the time Mr. Bush rallied the troops this morning at the United States Central Command forward headquarters in the 115-degree moonscape here, the victor in the war on Iraq was clearly on a high, pumped up by the palpable sense in both Europe and the Middle East that the American president had new powers to wield. </p> <p> For months, local residents say, the group of 15 Arab and Central Asian fighters lived quietly in a two-story house here, among the hundreds of guerrillas who had turned this wooded vale near the Russian border into a burgeoning center of Islamic militancy. </p> <p> Like many of those who gathered here, the fighters had come over the snowy passes from Chechnya, where they had been helping their fellow Muslims in their struggle to break with the Russian republic. They exercised to stay in shape and went into the woods to practice shooting. Some of the militants departed, presumably for Russia, while new ones came to prepare for the fight. </p> <p> The big handshake between the trans-Atlantic odd couple, President Bush and President Jacques Chirac of France, finally happened here this hot and muggy Sunday afternoon on the shores of Lake Geneva. It was, in the end, both a dramatic letdown and a diplomatic success: decorous, accompanied by polite chatter, but with no glimpse into the feelings of two emotional men. </p> <p> What was far more telling was watching Mr. Bush on a flower-filled terrace of the 19th-century Hôtel Royal -- as Mr. Chirac stayed by his side -- working the room of fellow global power brokers. </p> <p> Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain said today that Russia ad pledged to suspend a planned shipment of nuclear fuel to Iran until the Iranian government accepts new international controls on its nuclear program, but Russia's top nuclear official said that no such promise had been made. </p> <p> Mr. Blair's remarks, and the denial, raised new questions about Russia's once-solid commitment to help Iran build and run a nuclear reactor at Bushehr, on the Persian Gulf. </p> <p> With Iran facing growing pressure to be more forthcoming about its nuclear program, the United Nations top nuclear weapons inspector, the Russian foreign minister and a group of European Union ministers today urged it to sign a protocol that would give inspectors the right to conduct more intrusive examinations of its facilities. </p> <p> The calls came after the governing board of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is meeting in Vienna, formally reviewed a recent report that gave new details about Iranian plans for a heavy water research reactor, which could be used in the production of plutonium for nuclear weapons. </p> <p> United States military commanders say foreign fighters are being actively recruited by loyalists to Saddam Hussein to join the resistance against American forces in Iraq, posing a new challenge to efforts to stabilize the country. </p> <p> Military officials say that American troops in Iraq have had to contend with Syrians, Saudis, Yemenis, Algerians, Lebanese and even Chechens. </p> <p> His stooped, limping figure dressed in local baggy Afghan clothes is unremarkable on the busy street here, but when Nek Muhammad turns and looks up, his staring blue eyes and ginger hair mark him as a stranger. </p> <p> He is Ukrainian, his real name is Gennady Anatolevich Tsevma, and he is one of dozens of former prisoners of war and deserters left behind in Afghanistan from the 10-year-long Soviet occupation of the country in the 1980's. Trapped for so long during two decades of war in Afghanistan, Mr. Tsevma is married and settled now with a family, but he is torn by yearning for home and a reluctance to leave the life he has become used to in Afghanistan. </p> <p> Dr. David Kelly, the British microbiologist who committed suicide last week while caught up in a dispute about whether the British government doctored intelligence reports on Iraq's weapons programs, played a key role in Western efforts to uncover biological warfare programs in the former Soviet Union and Iraq. </p> <p> A Oxford-educated scientist who took pride in his status as a civil servant, Dr. Kelly was Britain's leading specialist on biological weapons. </p> <p> The Bush administration, which spurned the United Nations in its drive to depose Saddam Hussein in Iraq, is finding itself forced back into the arms of the international body because other nations are refusing to contribute peacekeeping troops or reconstruction money without United Nations approval. </p> <p> With the costs of stabilizing Iraq hovering at $4 billion a month and with American troops being killed at a steady rate, administration officials acknowledge that they are rethinking their strategy and may seek a United Nations resolution for help that would placate other nations, like India, France and Germany. </p> <p> A Russian military court today convicted a decorated army colonel of the murder of an 18-year-old woman in Chechnya. The verdict came at the end of a second trial in the case that has highlighted the vagaries of criminal justice in Russia. </p> <p> With the decision today, Col. Yuri D. Budanov became the highest-ranking officer convicted for what Russian and international rights groups say are routine abuses against civilians in Russia's war against Chechnya's rebels. Colonel Budanov was sentenced to 10 years in prison and stripped of his military rank and awards. </p> <p> The village of Tolstopaltsevo lies in the wooded outskirts of the capital, a humble, in places dilapidated cluster of wooden houses known as dachas, where Russians go to escape Moscow's urban jostle. </p> <p> These days, however, the village is no sanctuary from the fear that has descended, like the summer heat, on Moscow and much of Russia. </p> <p> Russia today received Iran's chief nuclear official, Gholam Reza Aghazadeh, to discuss details of the two countries' cooperation on nuclear power. There is growing concern in other countries that Iran is developing nuclear weapons. </p> <p> Mr. Aghazadeh met with the Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, and with the atomic energy minister, Aleksandr Rumyantsev. The Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it had pressed Iran to sign an international protocol that would allow more aggressive United Nations inspections of its nuclear sites. </p> <p> A decommissioned Russian nuclear submarine being towed to a scrapyard sank in the Barents Sea today, killing 9 of the submarine's crew of 10, officials said. </p> <p> The submarine, the K-159, was decommissioned in 1989 and had been rusting in a submarine graveyard at the former Soviet naval base at Gremikha until its final 200-mile voyage, supported by four giant pontoons and towed by a tugboat. Neither of its nuclear reactors was operating, defense and naval officials said, according to Russian news agencies. The submarine sank before dawn about three miles northwest of Kildin Island off the Kola Peninsula in Russia's far north. </p> <p> Using the bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad as a rallying cry, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell sought today to build support for a new Security Council resolution that would persuade other major nations to contribute more troops and aid to secure and rebuild Iraq under the aegis of the American-led occupation. </p> <p> His appeal was not rejected out of hand by any Council members, but it met with a wary response from Germany and Russia and an icy rebuke from France. </p> <p> The United States and North Korea had their first face-to-face meeting in four months here this afternoon as part of six-nation negotiations on how to end North Korea's nuclear program, but diplomats played down prospects for an early breakthrough. </p> <p> James A. Kelly, assistant secretary of state, and Kim Yong Il, North Korea's deputy foreign minister, met on the sidelines of formal discussions, breaking a freeze on direct dialogue that began after a stormy meeting in April in which North Korea warned that it was moving quickly to develop and deploy nuclear arms. </p> <p> Victor Bout, by most accounts the world's largest arms trafficker, had agreed to meet me in the lounge of the Renaissance Hotel in Moscow, a monolithic post-Soviet structure populated by third-tier prostitutes and men in dark suits. Bout's older brother, Sergei, waited with me, as did Richard Chichakli, a Syrian-born naturalized American citizen who lives in Dallas. Sergei helps run Bout's many air-cargo companies. Chichakli, an accountant, calls himself a former business associate of Bout and his ''friend and brother.'' </p> <p> As we waited, Chichakli tried to discourage me from pressing Bout about his connections, suggesting that there were some things I didn't want to know. ''They'll put you on your knees before they execute you,'' he said. Then he nodded toward the doorway. ''Here he comes. Does he look like the world's largest arms dealer to you?'' </p> <p> Sharp differences emerged today between the top American administrator in Iraq and the country's interim government as the United States sought to calm a city unnerved by the truck bomb that killed 20 people in the United Nations headquarters. </p> <p> Iraqi officials described a tense meeting between L. Paul Bremer III and the Iraqi Governing Council. Mr. Bremer, they said, demanded that the 25-member Council exert more authority, condemn the bombing strongly and communicate better with the Iraqi people. </p> <p> Will billions of dollars in aid in exchange for North Korea ending its nuclear weapons program accelerate or reverse grudging free market moves by the world's most Communist nation? </p> <p> As envoys from the United States and Japan, the world's two largest economies, prepare for talks next week with North Korea over its nuclear weapons program, economists debate the depth of commitment to market reform in a country that once planned to ban cash. </p> <p> Amid signs of growing diplomatic and military isolation, North Korea lashed out at the United States, South Korea and Japan today, barely a week before the scheduled start of international talks on North Korea's nuclear program. </p> <p> Russia, traditionally an ally of North Korea, embarked today on a 10-day maritime exercise, partly in waters near North Korea, that will involve Japan and South Korea, two traditional enemies of the North. The exercise is the first time that warships from those three countries have conducted joint maneuvers. </p> <p> The clandestine meeting between the arms dealer and the prospective buyer of the surface-to-air missile, the government says, took place at a hotel with a commanding view of the runways at Newark International Airport on Sept. 17, 2002, less than a week after the first anniversary of the September 2001 hijackings. </p> <p> The two watched aircraft take off and land at the nearby airfield, according to an F.B.I. affidavit unsealed today in federal court in Newark. The arms dealer, Hemant Lakhani, a Briton born in India, told the buyer, who was in reality an F.B.I. informant, that he was aware that the shoulder-fired Russian-made missile would be used in an attack against a commercial airliner in the United States, the affidavit says. </p> <p> Anyone who says America's European allies have no stomach for action has never flown with Norway's defense minister, Kristin Krohn Devold. I might give her this compliment, if only the helicopter we're in weren't plummeting backward. </p> <p> Moments later, we are racing at treetop level toward a Norwegian military base, from which a contingent of mine-clearing troops is about to be dispatched to Iraq, and Devold encourages her pilots to show me what they can do. The chopper banks wildly, veering to the right and left, so that in one instant I am looking straight down at the ground and, in the next, straight up at the sky. The trees are never more than a few yards beneath us. </p> <p> North Korea told diplomats from five other nations on Thursday that it planned to declare formally that it has become a nuclear power and may test an atomic bomb in the near future to prove it, according to senior Bush administration officials. </p> <p> The statement by Kim Yong Il, North Korea's deputy foreign minister, appeared to sharply contradict the spirit of the six-party talks organized by China, North Korea's closest ally and leading aid donor, and may buttress the contention of hard-liners in the Bush administration that the reclusive Communist government has no intention of reaching a verifiable agreement to dismantle its nuclear program. </p> <p> Even though the six nations that gathered for talks here this week have yet to agree on how to stop North Korea's nuclear program, at least one breakthrough was evident: the emergence of China as a more assertive diplomatic power. </p> <p> China cajoled and badgered the United States, North Korea, South Korea, Japan and Russia to join negotiations on how to resolve the Korea arms crisis. It succeeded in pressing participants to commit to another round, despite obvious tensions between the United States and North Korea. </p> <p> The United States, North Korea and four other nations ended three days of sometimes fiery negotiations here on Friday and decided to keep talking, as Bush administration officials concluded that the diplomatic track still offered the best hope of resolving the Korean nuclear crisis. </p> <p> Though North Korea repeatedly threatened to test and deploy nuclear weapons if its demands for a nonaggression pact were not met in full, several senior administration officials said the six-party negotiations had in some respects ''exceeded our expectations,'' persuading them to push for a new round soon. </p> <p> North Korea and the United States announced today that they had agreed to hold regional talks over North Korea's nuclear weapons program, in a victory for the Bush administration, which resisted 10 months of pressure to hold one-on-one talks with the North. </p> <p> By guaranteeing seats at the table to North Korea's neighbors -- China, Russia, Japan and South Korea -- Washington hopes to draw regional players into a pact that would verify the dismantlement of the North's nuclear weapons program, probably in return for international economic aid and an American promise not to attack North Korea militarily. </p> <p> Now that the United States and North Korea have finally agreed to talk, the issue is what to talk about. A priority of the Bush administration, as well as its predecessors, has long been the dismantling of the North's nuclear-weapons program. This goal is realistic, but only if the United States is prepared to engage North Korea on a wide range of issues -- especially its failed economy. </p> <p> The structure of the talks -- scheduled for next month, they will include China, Russia, South Korea and Japan -- ensures that the major regional players will be able to emphasize to Pyongyang that its nuclear weapons program must first be frozen and then dismantled entirely. Unfortunately, North Korea probably won't listen to a proposal that requires it to make all the initial concessions. It already had something close to the deal Mr. Bush is now proposing under President Bill Clinton -- but then Pyongyang willfully ignored it and began a secret nuclear program in the late 1990's. </p> <p> The news that North Korea has agreed to multilateral talks has been greeted with relief and hope from Moscow to Beijing to Washington. The United States has consistently insisted on multilateral talks with the North, while North Korea had been calling for talks only between the United States and North Korea. Now that North Korea has agreed to talks that will include Japan, China, Russia and South Korea, the Bush administration is focusing on the need to dismantle the North's nuclear-weapons program. </p> <p> However, the issue of multilateral versus bilateral talks is only peripheral to the nuclear crisis, and the prospect for resolving the yearlong standoff between the United States and North Korea remains dim. If the United States offers nothing but a demand that North Korea abandon its nuclear program, the meetings will be useless. If there is nothing to discuss, why even meet? </p> <p> North Korea will come under intense diplomatic pressure to scrap its nuclear weapons program on Wednesday as the United States, North Korea and its four neighbors begin unusual six-party negotiations on how to resolve the Korean arms crisis. </p> <p> The talks, scheduled to take place over three days here in the Chinese capital, are the most concerted diplomatic push on North Korea since President Bush took office. They pose a difficult challenge to the administration as it seeks to persuade the North to abandon its nuclear ambitions without directly rewarding it for doing so, which Mr. Bush said would be like succumbing to blackmail. </p> <p> International inspectors have found traces of highly enriched uranium at an Iranian facility, according to a new confidential report distributed today. The traces could be an indication that Tehran has already produced weapons-grade nuclear materials. </p> <p> Iran denied producing nuclear materials, said the report, by the International Atomic Energy Association, the conclusions of which were obtained by The New York Times. The report added, ''Additional work is also required to enable the agency to arrive at conclusions about Iran's statements that there have been no uranium enrichment activities in Iran involving nuclear material.'' </p> <p> The Bush administration said today that North Korea appeared ready to agree to proposed multiparty talks to resolve the impasse over the North's refusal to dismantle its accelerating nuclear weapons program. </p> <p> Administration officials and Asian diplomats said that while no formal word had been received in Washington, there were several indications that months of pressure had been successful in getting North Korea to meet the American demand for talks to include South Korea, Japan and possibly Russia. China took part in discussions with the United States and the North in April. </p> <p> For White House planners, the image had to be picture perfect: the first lady, the American flag and the Eiffel Tower all in the same photo frame. </p> <p> So when Laura Bush raised the American flag today to signal the return of the United States to Unesco after a 19-year boycott, there was nothing subtle about the symbols. </p> <p> On Aug. 30, the K-159, a Russian November-class nuclear submarine, sank during bad weather in the Barents Sea, taking with it nine sailors. The K-159, which had been decommissioned by the Russian Navy in 1989, broke loose as it was being towed to the Nerpa dismantling site near Murmansk. </p> <p> Unfortunately, the K-159 accident is symptomatic of a larger malaise plaguing the Russian Navy. More than 30 of Russia's first-generation nuclear submarines are deteriorating, with the most typical problems including hull leaks and the failure of safety systems. </p> <p> Muhammad, a scrawny 19-year-old with a wisp of a beard, said he ignored the talk at first. But after hearing it again and again, it got to him. </p> <p> Day in and day out, students in his Islamic school in Pakistan chattered excitedly about crossing the border and joining the holy war. Rapture, they said, awaited those who perished. </p> <p> The resurgent Taliban has embarked on a strategy of small guerrilla attacks intended to frustrate and steadily bleed American forces in Afghanistan and to force the United States to expend billions of dollars in military costs, according to two Taliban officials interviewed recently. </p> <p> Hajji Ibrahim, who identified himself as a Taliban commander, said the group's goal was to tie down the United States in Afghanistan and force it to spend huge sums responding to limited attacks that draw American forces ''here to there, here to there.'' He confidently predicted that the United States, sapped by a slow, costly and grinding conflict, would abandon Afghanistan after two to three years, and repeatedly compared the current situation to the defeat of Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 1980's. </p> <p> Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, pressed by France and by some Iraqis to agree to a speedier timetable toward self-government in Iraq, cautioned here today that the process of restoring sovereignty had to be carried out in stages and that it might not be seen as legitimate if it went too rapidly. </p> <p> Speaking after meetings with leaders of the American-led occupation and with the 25-member Iraqi Governing Council, which was handpicked by American authorities, Mr. Powell also said he had found that more progress was being made in securing and rebuilding Iraq than had been emphasized in news reports, mentioning for example new parent-teacher groups at local schools. </p> <p> The Bush administration, seeking new avenues to induce skeptical countries to contribute troops and money in Iraq, circulated a draft Security Council resolution today that would create a multinational force led by the United States and authorized by the United Nations. </p> <p> The proposed draft would also invite the Iraqi Governing Council to develop a timetable for drafting a constitution and holding elections, ideally leading to the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty and the withdrawal of all American and other foreign forces. </p> <p> The United States maintained its dominance in the international arms market last year, especially in sales to developing nations, according to a new Congressional report. </p> <p> The United States was the leader in total worldwide sales in 2002, with about $13.3 billion, or 45.5 percent of global conventional weapons deals, a rise from $12.1 billion in 2001. Of that, $8.6 billion was to developing nations, or about 48.6 percent of conventional arms deals concluded with developing nations last year, according to the report. </p> <p> Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is to go to Geneva this weekend to discuss the American resolution to broaden international involvement in Iraq with Security Council members. Three of them announced today their own proposals to accelerate the transfer of civil authority to Iraqis. </p> <p> The proposed amendments by France, Germany and Russia would expand the United Nations mandate, giving the organization, in cooperation with the interim administration, supervision over when and how Iraqis regain sovereignty. </p> <p> Last month four senior American government officials traveled to Saudi Arabia to revisit the troubled topic of the desert kingdom's antiterrorism efforts. Unsure of what to expect, the American delegation was pleasantly surprised when a pro forma appointment with Crown Prince Abdullah went on for more than two hours. </p> <p> During the trip the Saudis also committed themselves to carrying out a series of measures to combat terrorism, United States law enforcement and intelligence officials said. Among the actions, Saudi officials said, were a ban on cash contributions in local mosques and the removal of donation boxes for charities from shopping malls. American officials believe that Saudi mosques and charitable organizations are crucial pipelines for terrorist financing. </p> <p> The Bush administration, incensed by France's demands for greater United Nations oversight in Iraq, is working to isolate France and win a majority at the United Nations Security Council for the American approach, administration officials said today. </p> <p> In an echo of a tactic the administration tried earlier this year, without notable success, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell is stepping up his efforts to enlist the support of Russia, Germany and other nations for American control over the occupation and transition to self-rule in Iraq, even though many of them sided with France in opposing the war. </p> <p> President Bush presented President Hu Jintao of China with a new, if still vague, American plan here on Sunday that would provide a five-nation security guarantee to North Korea -- but not a formal nonaggression treaty -- if the North dismantles all of its nuclear weapons programs. </p> <p> Mr. Bush's decision to find a way to provide assurances to North Korea -- over the objections of those in his administration who have made it clear that they do not believe the United States should be negotiating with the North at all -- is a subtle but important shift in his approach to the North Korean nuclear crisis. </p> <p> The Bush administration is virtually assured of gaining Security Council approval of a revised United Nations resolution on Iraq's future, diplomats here said Tuesday, but it remains unclear whether the measure will be adopted overwhelmingly or in a less convincing, abstention-riddled vote. </p> <p> The resolution, however it passes, will mark an important step in the administration's attempt to gain broader international backing both for the occupation forces in Iraq and the reconstruction of the country. </p> <p> France and Germany decided to join Russia in support of the United Nations resolution on the future of Iraq not because they had been won over by new provisions, officials said Thursday, but out of concern over a spiral of violence in the Middle East coupled with a sense that few new concessions could be wrung from the Bush administration. </p> <p> ''We all see a spiral of violence and terror that is growing in Iraq,'' the French foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, told reporters on Thursday at a summit meeting of European leaders. Noting the deterioration of the situation ''in the Middle East as a whole,'' he said it was ''important to send a message to the Iraqi people that we also want the best conditions for the reconstruction of Iraq.'' </p> <p> The Security Council unanimously approved Thursday an American and British resolution authorizing an American-led multinational force in Iraq. The measure also set a Dec. 15 deadline for the Iraqi Governing Council to lay out a timetable for creating a constitution and democratic government. </p> <p> The international unity on display in the Security Council chamber when all 15 ambassadors raised their hands in assent was something of a diplomatic triumph for the Bush administration after months of apparent isolation here. </p> <p> Bush administration officials reacted with dismay on Friday to Secretary General Kofi Annan's reluctance to play a supporting role in the Iraqi political transition. His position emboldened critics of the United States' approach and jeopardized the draft of a Security Council resolution on Iraq's future. </p> <p> Mr. Annan spoke once Friday with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and twice with John D. Negroponte, the United States envoy here. </p> <p> Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov of Russia said Thursday that his government expected the American military to withdraw from bases in two former Soviet republics in Central Asia once the mission in Afghanistan was completed. </p> <p> On a day spent reassuring NATO defense ministers that Russia seeks broader cooperation with the Atlantic alliance and has no plans to announce a policy of nuclear pre-emption, Mr. Ivanov also said Russia reserved the right to intervene militarily in former Soviet states if the human rights of ethnic Russians were violated. That forceful restatement of Moscow's concern for ethnic Russians in former Soviet republics comes as NATO prepares to expand beyond former Warsaw Pact nations to include three of those former Soviet states: Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. </p> <p> ''We never asked Russia to not build the plant at Bushehr,'' Secretary of State Colin Powell said last month. That's strange. When I was in the Clinton administration, we told the Russians, and more than once, not to build that nuclear power plant in Iran. When they persisted, we pushed them to narrow the scope of their cooperation. In this we succeeded. </p> <p> At the United States' urging, the Russians insisted that the Iranians purchase the nuclear fuel from Russian companies and return the spent fuel to Russia for disposal. Now Russia has almost finished building a reactor at Bushehr, but because of the spent-fuel arrangement the Iranians will not be able to get material for nuclear weapons from it. </p> <p> Shoulders back, chest out, the young soldier stands as if on parade in his camouflage fatigues -- his boots polished, his rifle at his shoulder, a halo around his head. </p> <p> His face is the blank mask of a man for whom duty is life. It is not easy being a soldier, or a saint. </p> <p> Germany, France and Russia, three of the most vocal opponents of the war in Iraq, reunited in the Security Council on Friday to urge an international conference for the country, much like the conference for Afghanistan in 2001. </p> <p> The three countries also demanded that the United States and Britain ensure that the political transition in Iraq involve all nonviolent elements of Iraqi society, as well as neighboring countries, and that the United Nations be involved throughout. </p> <p> Russia has offered to forgive more than half of Iraq's $8 billion debt to Russia, officials of Iraq's interim government said here on Monday, after the Iraqis signaled that Russia would have the chance to revive oil contracts signed during the Saddam Hussein era. </p> <p> Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, the current president of the American-backed Iraqi Governing Council, said President Vladimir V. Putin proposed in talks with the Iraqis to wipe out 65 percent of Iraq's Soviet-era debts to Russia in return for favorable treatment of Russian oil and other companies. </p> <p> Russia, France, Germany, Canada and other countries barred by the Pentagon from bidding for $18.6 billion worth of prime reconstruction contracts in Iraq reacted angrily Wednesday, saying that the move was all the more astonishing given recent appeals by Washington for help in postwar Iraq. </p> <p> Russia's defense minister, Sergei B. Ivanov, immediately ruled out any write-off of Iraq's $120 billion debt, a project that just last week President Bush appointed former Secretary of State James A. Baker III to oversee. ''Iraq's debt to the Russia Federation comes to $8 billion, and as far as the Russian government's position on this, it is not planning'' any forgiveness of those arrears, he told the Interfax news agency. ''Iraq is not a poor country.'' </p> <p> President Bush found himself in the awkward position on Wednesday of calling the leaders of France, Germany and Russia to ask them to forgive Iraq's debts, just a day after the Pentagon excluded those countries and others from $18 billion in American-financed Iraqi reconstruction projects. </p> <p> White House officials were fuming about the timing and the tone of the Pentagon's directive, even while conceding that they had approved the Pentagon policy of limiting contracts to 63 countries that have given the United States political or military aid in Iraq. </p> <p> James Baker sets off to negotiate Iraqi debt forgiveness with our estranged allies. And at that very moment the deputy secretary of defense releases a ''Determination and Findings'' on reconstruction contracts that not only excludes those allies from bidding, but does so with highly offensive language. What's going on? </p> <p> Maybe I'm giving Paul Wolfowitz too much credit, but I don't think this was mere incompetence. I think the administration's hard-liners are deliberately sabotaging reconciliation. </p> <p> The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is arguably the most popular treaty in history: except for five states, every nation in the world is part of it. For more than three decades, it has helped curb the spread of nuclear weapons. </p> <p> Since 9/11, however, and especially in the last several months, the viability of the treaty has been called into question. Some say it is obsolete. Others say it is merely ineffective. In support of its argument each side cites the situation in Iran, which has been able to advance a nuclear weapons program despite being a member of the treaty. </p> <p> The Pentagon has barred French, German and Russian companies from competing for $18.6 billion in contracts for the reconstruction of Iraq, saying it was acting to protect ''the essential security interests of the United States.'' </p> <p> The directive, issued Friday by Paul D. Wolfowitz, the deputy defense secretary, represents the most substantive retaliation to date by the Bush administration against American allies who opposed its decision to go to war in Iraq. </p> <p> Secretary of State Colin L. Powell embarked on a five-nation, four-day tour on Tuesday, hoping to mend fences with Europeans upset by the American strategy in Iraq and to stiffen the resolve of North African nations rattled by terror attacks to continue to fight Islamic militants. </p> <p> As he jetted from the Netherlands to Tunisia to Morocco, Mr. Powell carried a message that American success in Iraq and in the broader fight against terrorism would require allies, partnerships and the cooperation of international organizations, including the United Nations and NATO. </p> <p> Russia is hoping to leverage its plans for debt relief for Iraq to win the revival of oil development projects signed under Saddam Hussein and suspended by the occupation authorities, Bush administration officials say. </p> <p> The administration, which is formally taking a hands-off approach that would leave decisions on contracts to a future Iraqi government, is giving tentative approval to Moscow's approach, which could mean billions for Russian companies. </p> <p> Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, arriving in Georgia for the inauguration of its new president, asserted that Russia had no reason to be concerned about the United States desire for friendship with this troubled region, which Russians consider within their sphere of influence. </p> <p> Only two months after a popular revolt forced the resignation of Eduard A. Shevardnadze as Georgia's president, Mr. Powell was here to support the efforts of the newly elected president, Mikhail Saakashvili, to gain control of a country widely described as fractured, impoverished and hobbled by corruption. </p> <p> The Bush administration, trying to rescue its troubled plan to restore sovereignty to Iraq, is joining Iraqi leaders to press the United Nations to play a role in choosing an interim government in Baghdad, administration officials said Thursday. </p> <p> L. Paul Bremer III, the American administrator in Baghdad, and an Iraqi delegation led by Adnan Pachachi, the current chairman of the Iraqi Governing Council, will make an urgent appeal on Monday for greater United Nations involvement, the officials said. </p> <p> He is the last man left, ragged and forgotten in his two-room house, and when he dies this little village lost in the snows of central Russia will die too. </p> <p> The timbers of his walls are cracking and he has hung coats over his broken windows to keep out the wind. He bustles, muttering, through useless clutter, heating a tin cup of tea. </p> <p> Intelligence shortcomings, as we see, have a thousand fathers; secret intelligence triumphs are orphans. Here is the unremarked story of ''the Farewell dossier'': how a C.I.A. campaign of computer sabotage resulting in a huge explosion in Siberia -- all engineered by a mild-mannered economist named Gus Weiss -- helped us win the cold war. </p> <p> Weiss worked down the hall from me in the Nixon administration. In early 1974, he wrote a report on Soviet advances in technology through purchasing and copying that led the beleaguered president -- détente notwithstanding -- to place restrictions on the export of computers and software to the U.S.S.R. </p> <p> The United States and North Korea said Saturday that they were committed to deepening negotiations over the North's nuclear weapons program, ending four days of inconclusive discussions with an unusual show of conciliation. </p> <p> Senior Bush administration officials and Kim Kye Kwan, North Korea's top negotiator at the six-nation talks here, said that while their main differences remained unresolved, the talks had proved useful. They pledged to meet in smaller working groups soon and hold another formal session before the end of June. </p> <p> Qatar has arrested two Russian secret agents and charged them in the killing of an exiled Chechen leader there, prompting a sharply worded rebuke from Russia on Thursday that accused Qatari authorities of violating international law. </p> <p> In a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry denied any Russian involvement in the death of Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, the former president of the Chechen republic, who was killed Feb. 13 when a bomb destroyed his car in Doha, the capital of Qatar. </p> <p> The United States, North Korea and four other nations on Thursday discussed freezing North Korea's nuclear program in exchange for energy aid. But the continuing talks here also exposed stark disagreements that left diplomats wondering whether they could emerge with much more than a commitment to keep negotiating. </p> <p> Both the United States and North Korea appeared to make modest concessions at the talks, several participants said, and the tone was described as constructive and lacking the invective that often punctuates discussions with North Korea. The two had private meetings during each of the first two days as well as participating in group discussions. </p> <p> Inspectors have found evidence that some of the highly enriched uranium found on nuclear machinery in Iran came from Russia, European diplomats and American experts said Friday. The nuclear fuel appears to have come through the global black market, the experts added, and not with the blessings of Moscow. </p> <p> With the findings, Russia emerges as a new and unexpected foreign source of supply to Iran's nuclear efforts. Recent revelations had shown that the Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan had provided Iran with some sophisticated centrifuge technology that could be used to refine weapons-grade uranium through his hidden nuclear trading network, according to international nuclear officials and Dr. Khan's own testimony. </p> <p> The United States, North Korea and four other nations were due to issue a statement Saturday pledging to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, but they left almost all major disputes about the North's nuclear program unresolved, officials and news reports said. </p> <p> In a joint statement that China, the host of the six-nation talks, was scrambling to finalize Saturday afternoon, the participants also agreed to meet again by June and to establish working groups that would tackle some of the most contentious issues about nuclear disarmament before then, according to Bush administration officials. </p> <p> A project to destroy the plutonium from thousands of retired Russian and American nuclear weapons has been delayed, and some experts say they fear that the work may never be done. </p> <p> The plan was to have both countries build factories that could mix uranium with plutonium, the material at the heart of nuclear bombs, to be burned as fuel for civilian reactors. It was conceived in the mid-1990's at a time of intense concern over the security of weapons materials in the former Soviet Union; Russia agreed to it in 2000. </p> <p> The United States and North Korea have agreed to resume six-party talks later this month over the North's nuclear weapons program, the State Department said Tuesday. </p> <p> The negotiations, scheduled to start in Beijing on Feb. 25, are likely to focus on North Korea's offer to suspend its nuclear programs in return for a security guarantee and other concessions. </p> <p> To unravel our intelligence failures in Iraq, it helps to look back at what was once one of the most secret and scary chapters in U.S.-Soviet relations. An intelligence failure risked nuclear war in the 1980's -- but this was a mistake by the K.G.B. </p> <p> In 1981, we now know, the K.G.B. chairman said at a secret conference that President Ronald Reagan was planning to launch a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. The Soviets became consumed with the U.S. threat, just as the Bush administration became obsessed with the Iraq threat. The K.G.B. ordered all its offices in NATO countries to seek evidence of Mr. Reagan's plans for a pre-emptive nuclear strike, and they code-named the effort RYAN. </p> <p> Almost two weeks after North Korea agreed to new, supposedly more intimate ''working groups'' to discuss its nuclear weapons program, Bush administration officials say that the agenda for the talks remains unclear and that the discussions may not occur until April or May. </p> <p> The idea of trying to resolve disagreements over North Korea's nuclear programs in one or more working groups came up in the last round of talks in Beijing at the end of February. Besides the United States and North Korea, Russia, China, South Korea and Japan took part. </p> <p> If the Japanese have their way, this village in northern Japan, an area known for its apples and sea cucumbers, will become home to a project that could give birth to the energy of the future. </p> <p> The project, ITER, for International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, would try to emulate the sun's nuclear fusion to produce safe, clean and inexhaustible energy. The 30-year, $12 billion research center would be the second largest international scientific project after the International Space Station. </p> <p> North Korean radio on Saturday explicitly rejected the formula the United States has put forward as its bottom-line position in talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear programs, raising doubts about whether the fitful negotiations are making even limited progress. </p> <p> The statement carried by Radio Pyongyang and monitored by news agencies in South Korea came just after a visit to North Korea by China's foreign minister, Li Zhaoxing, and shortly before a visit to the region by Vice President Dick Cheney that is planned for April. It used typically unrestrained language in accusing the United States of secretly planning a war. </p> <p> In another sign of just how far Russia has changed, Irkut, a formerly secret maker of military airplanes that had spent decades helping the Soviet Union defend itself against the capitalist West, has turned to the stock market to raise cash to buy other companies and develop new planes. </p> <p> With its initial public offering last week, it became the first Russian military company to sell shares on the stock market. The shares -- representing 20 percent of the company, and worth about $100 million -- trade in Moscow now, where they closed Wednesday at 76 United States cents each, up 17 percent from their first day of trading last Thursday. By the end of the year, the company says, it intends to tap the richer capital markets of London and New York. </p> <p> There was no breakthrough, no eureka, no flash of insight. It happened slowly, the advances gradual until what Dr. Gernot Zippe and his colleagues had invented was a compact, almost elegant device for collecting uranium's rare U-235 isotope. </p> <p> The feat might have remained obscure, except that it helped define the nuclear era: by the 1960's, Zippe-type machines had become the easiest way to make fuel for reactors as well as weapons of terrifying power, for lighting cities or destroying them. </p> <p> On Wednesday morning, just hours before a suicide bomber demolished a Saudi police building in downtown Riyadh, the family of a young man was accepting congratulations for his death in the jihad over the border in Iraq, the one that enjoys no small support here. </p> <p> ''He went to Iraq seeking martyrdom because of the recent events there,'' Abdullah al-Enezi said of his younger brother Majid, who was training to be a computer technician. </p> <p> The fighter jets that landed this week at the airfield northwest of here do not pose much of a threat, but their arrival at what was once one of the Soviet Union's largest bases underlined in bold the new borders being drawn between Europe and Russia. </p> <p> The jets -- four Belgian F-16's supported by 100 Belgian, Danish and Norwegian troops -- have come to police the skies over the Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, former Soviet republics that officially joined NATO on Monday along with Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. </p> <p> NATO formally welcomed seven new members into the alliance on Friday, stretching its security umbrella to the borders of Russia and prompting Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to reassure Moscow that it should not feel threatened. </p> <p> The NATO ministers also issued a statement calling for greater coordination against terrorism, and the new members expressed enthusiastic support for deeper NATO involvement in Iraq. </p> <p> A recurring fear haunts the West's increasingly tense confrontation with Iran: Is its work on civilian nuclear power actually a ruse for making a deadly atomic arsenal, as has been the case with other countries? </p> <p> Next month, the United Nations plans to take up that question at a board meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency, in Vienna. The diplomatic backdrop includes possible sanctions and even the threat of war. </p> <p> In an effort to keep the raw materials for nuclear bombs out of the hands of terrorists, the Energy Department will undertake a $450 million campaign to retrieve nuclear materials that the United States and the Soviet Union originally sent around the world for research purposes, the energy secretary will announce on Wednesday in Vienna. </p> <p> The department has been trying for years, with limited success, to recover unused uranium fuel at research reactors. An audit, announced in February, found that the department was likely to recover only about half of the 5,200 kilograms of uranium it was seeking and that no effort had been made to recover an additional 12,300 kilograms. Depending on the skill of the designers and builders, it takes as little as 5 kilograms to make a bomb the size of the one that destroyed Hiroshima, experts say. </p> <p> Issuing a new broadside against President Bush's national security policy, Senator John Kerry said that Mr. Bush's ''almost myopic'' focus on Iraq had made Americans ''less safe'' by giving North Korea and Iran the time and opportunity to speed toward the construction of nuclear weapons. </p> <p> In an hourlong interview Friday on foreign policy, Mr. Kerry covered pre-emptive military strikes and a range of other issues. He termed the administration's approach to remaking Iraq a ''crapshoot.'' And Mr. Kerry, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, touched on a series of proposals he will make next week to limit the spread of nuclear materials, arguing all the while that Mr. Bush's assessments of threats to America were riddled with misjudgments. </p> <p> News had just broken of a terrible wrongdoing committed by American soldiers, and the secretary of defense and the national security adviser debated whether there was any way to stop newspapers and television news programs from showing graphic photographs of the victims. </p> <p> ''They're pretty terrible,'' said Melvin R. Laird, the secretary of defense, of the color photographs of the men, women and children killed in the My Lai massacre in South Vietnam. </p> <p> Tokyo is abuzz with reports that the prime minister of Japan is planning a visit to North Korea. Meanwhile, South Korea and North Korea are organizing a meeting of army generals, the highest level inter-Korean military meeting in decades. </p> <p> Pieces in Northeast Asia's long frozen security puzzle are starting to shift as envoys from the United States, China, Japan, Russia and the two Koreas converge Wednesday in Beijing for midlevel talks on North Korea's nuclear weapons program. </p> <p> A HALF CENTURY after the Rosenbergs were executed as atom spies, there's really only one nagging question left about the case: Why did two seemingly ordinary people from Manhattan's Lower East Side sacrifice their lives for a distant cause when it meant orphaning the two young sons they claimed to love? What did they die for? </p> <p> ''Heir to an Execution: A Granddaughter's Story,'' Ivy Meeropol's sometimes teary 99-minute documentary film about her grandparents, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, provides some answers. While still unsatisfying, they may be as definitive as we're ever going to get. (The film has its television premiere tomorrow night at 8 on HBO.) </p> <p> The foreign minister of the new Iraqi interim government told the Security Council on Thursday that the resolution it is now considering must give Iraq full sovereignty, but he combined the appeal with a plea for the continued presence of foreign forces. </p> <p> ''I stress that any premature departure of international forces would lead to chaos and the real possibility of a civil war in Iraq,'' said the official, Hoshyar Zebari. </p> <p> A woman from Chechnya, an invalid, sat by a mound of dirty possessions, her three grandchildren wandering in the dust nearby. Their refugee camp was emptying, but they were too poor to buy a ride on the trucks hurriedly heading out of here. </p> <p> ''I have been packed and waiting for three days,'' said the woman, Manzha Yansuyeva, 78. ''I am hoping someone will pity us and help us move.'' </p> <p> At this week's NATO summit conference in Istanbul, it will be in the political interest of America's European adversaries -- France's Jacques Chirac and Germany's Gerhard Schröder -- to appear to cooperate with the coalition helping Iraq complete its liberation. </p> <p> At the same time, it is in the political interest of George W. Bush and Britain's Tony Blair to appear to be delighted with whatever safe and cheap aid that the Chirac-Schröder bloc allows NATO to offer instead of supplying alliance troops. </p> <p> Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld called on Russia on Saturday to fulfill a five-year-old pledge to withdraw 1,400 Russian troops and a huge stockpile of ammunition from a separatist region of this former Soviet republic. </p> <p> Stopping here for a brief visit en route to the NATO summit meeting, which begins Sunday in Istanbul, Mr. Rumsfeld thanked this country's Communist government for dispatching small teams of land-mine demolition experts to Iraq, to help the American-led military operation. </p> <p> Almost everywhere in the press one reads that President Bush sounds an awful lot like Ronald Reagan. Commentators and politicians alike have drawn the comparison between Mr. Bush's ''muscular'' foreign policy and the Reagan doctrine. However macho and aggressive Mr. Bush's foreign policy may be, when it came to the Soviet Union, Mr. Reagan's was anything but. </p> <p> In 1985, Mr. Reagan sent a long handwritten letter to Mikhail Gorbachev assuring him that he was prepared ''to cooperate in any reasonable way to facilitate such a withdrawal'' of the Soviets from Afghanistan. ''Neither of us,'' he added, ''wants to see offensive weapons, particularly weapons of mass destruction, deployed in space.'' Mr. Reagan eagerly sought to work with Mr. Gorbachev to rid the world of such weapons and to help the Soviet Union effect peaceful change in Eastern Europe. </p> <p> A military court on Thursday acquitted all six defendants in the 1994 killing of an investigative journalist who had uncovered graft in the Russian armed forces. </p> <p> The suspects, most of whom are former military officers, were already acquitted in the killing of the journalist, Dmitri Kholodov, by a Moscow court in 2002, but the case was retried on appeal from prosecutors and the victim's family. </p> <p> Eight Russian infantrymen sprinted for cover behind a wooden wall. The soldiers began firing, first with assault rifles, then with grenade launchers and antitank rockets. </p> <p> Tracers skipped off the ground; the crunch of exploding rockets reverberated in the air. Minutes later a jet fighter screamed overhead and performed multiple rolls, corkscrewing between Russian forest and low-hanging clouds. </p> <p> Secretary of State Colin L. Powell met with North Korea's foreign minister here on Friday in the highest-level meeting between the two nations in two years to discuss proposals intended to induce North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program, according to Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman. </p> <p> Mr. Powell and the foreign minister, Paek Nam-Sun, along with their delegations, met for about 20 minutes, Mr. Boucher said, and tried to clarify their positions on proposals advanced last month, in the last round of six-party talks on North Korea. </p> <p> This city is, by any definition, a great world capital, though you almost would not know that walking into the departure hall of Tempelhof Airport, which is as quiet as an old-fashioned dentist's waiting room, a very large one with gleaming linoleum floors, a soaring ceiling and the almost audible sound of History whispering someplace. </p> <p> ''Not exactly the atmosphere of a major international airport, is it?'' said Burkhard Kieker, an official at the Berlin Airport Authority, which runs all three of this city's airports, nodding ruefully at the adjacent departures hall, where perhaps half a dozen people were waiting for flights to such nearby destinations as Münster and Osnabrück. </p> <p> Russia is moving to become a major supplier of electricity and gas to North Korea at a time when the supply of nonnuclear energy sources available to that impoverished country is emerging as an important bargaining chip in talks intended to defuse North Korea's nuclear weapons program. </p> <p> ''We are building energy transmission lines to the North Korean border,'' Sergei Darkin, governor of Russia's Pacific Maritime region, said in an interview on Monday. Governor Darkin said that if President Vladimir V. Putin ''gives us the task of transmitting energy to North Korea next year, we will be ready to do that.'' </p> <p> The bazaar in this industrial city shows why Western companies regard Russia as a land of piracy. </p> <p> Bootlegged copies of new American movies -- ''King Arthur,'' ''Troy'' and ''Spider-Man 2'' -- sell for $3. Photoshop CS, a $600 program in Western stores, fetches $2.75. </p> <p> Most anyone who's worked in government has a story -- probably re-told often these days, given the Iraq debate -- about facing a big decision on the basis of information that then turned out to be wrong. My favorite is from August 1998 when, with Bill Clinton just three days away from a trip to Moscow, the Central Intelligence Agency reported that President Boris Yeltsin of Russia was dead. </p> <p> In 1998 the news that Mr. Yeltsin had died was, of course, no more surprising than the news, in 2003, that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. It matched what we knew of his health and habits, and the secretive handling of his earlier illnesses. Nor was anyone puzzled by the lack of an announcement. Russia's financial crash 10 days earlier had set off a political crisis, and we assumed a fierce Kremlin succession struggle was raging behind the scenes. </p> <p> Even as the Bush administration has worked to isolate North Korea in a campaign to make it drop its nuclear program, Asian and European governments have been actively engaging it on diplomatic, cultural and economic levels. Now, with the pace of engagement quickening, it is the administration that risks becoming isolated, experts say, a possible factor in a recent moderation in its stance. </p> <p> A country famous for its hermetic borders, North Korea now has embassies in 41 countries and diplomatic ties with 155. It recently held the first-ever military talks with its former archenemy, South Korea, and is moving toward normalizing diplomatic relations with its former colonizer, Japan. </p> <p> Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov of Russia on Saturday criticized NATO's expansion into the three Baltic states, and said citizens of the Western alliance's original member countries should be worried, too, that their tax dollars were being wasted. </p> <p> During a weekend visit by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, Mr. Ivanov said he remained ''reserved and negative'' about the entry into NATO in March of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, three former Soviet republics. </p> <p> The United States and Russia continued to dominate the global arms market last year, especially when measured in weapons deals to developing nations, although the total value of arms sales worldwide tumbled for the third consecutive year, according to a new Congressional study. </p> <p> The United States maintained its lead in worldwide weapons sales in 2003, signing deals worth more than $14.5 billion, or 56.7 percent of all arms agreements, up from $13.6 billion in 2002, the study showed. </p> <p> If a 10-kiloton nuclear weapon, a midget even smaller than the one that destroyed Hiroshima, exploded in Times Square, the fireball would reach tens of millions of degrees Fahrenheit. </p> <p> It would vaporize or destroy the theater district, Madison Square Garden, the Empire State Building, Grand Central Terminal and Carnegie Hall (along with me and my building). The blast would partly destroy a much larger area, including the United Nations. On a weekday some 500,000 people would be killed. </p> <p> Iran said Sunday that it would delay the start of its first nuclear reactor, in the southern city of Bushehr, until 2006, but that it intended to build more nuclear power plants with Russian aid. </p> <p> Assadollah Sabouri, the deputy chief of the Atomic Energy Organization, which is in charge of the power plant project, said at a news conference that the reactor would start seven months after the Russians hand over the keys, now expected to occur early in 2006. He said the reactor could then start by October 2006. The final cost will exceed $1 billion, he said. Iran had hoped at one point that the reactor would start operating by the end of 2003. </p> <p> The radiation experts arrived at Viktor Avram's auto repair shop last month, appearing beside the wall separating the shop from an enormous factory. The men warned Mr. Avram to take care where he strolled. </p> <p> ''They told me I could walk on the road,'' he recalled, nodding toward a dirt track that descends to the Moscow River. ''But they said I should stay to the left. To the right is radiation.'' </p> <p> ConocoPhillips paid nearly $2 billion at auction on Wednesday for the Russian government's stake in Lukoil, a purchase that could allow Conoco to become the first Western company to return to Iraq's oil fields. </p> <p> The deal is the latest indication that Western companies, largely shut out of new business in OPEC countries, view Russia as an alternative to replenish their oil reserves, increase their production and find new fields despite concerns over the Kremlin's growing sway in the Russian oil industry. </p> <p> Russia circulated a draft resolution among Security Council members on Friday that would establish a new list of terror suspects, all of whom would be subject to extradition. </p> <p> The introduction of the resolution comes three weeks after the suicide bombings of two Russian airliners and the hostage crisis in a school in Beslan, North Ossetia, that killed more than 320, half of them children. </p> <p> It was no accident that John Kerry appeared Tuesday on ''Live With Regis and Kelly'' and recalled his days as a young prosecutor in a rape case. Or that he then flew from New York to Jacksonville, Fla., to promote his health care proposals. Or that on Thursday in Davenport, Iowa, he will preside over a forum on national security with an audience solely of women. </p> <p> These appearances are part of an energetic drive by the Kerry campaign to win back voters that Democrats think are rightfully theirs: women. </p> <p> The brutal school siege in Russia, with hundreds of children dead and wounded, has touched off an unusual round of self-criticism and introspection in the Muslim and Arab world. </p> <p> ''It is a certain fact that not all Muslims are terrorists, but it is equally certain, and exceptionally painful, that almost all terrorists are Muslims,'' Abdel Rahman al-Rashed, the general manager of the widely watched satellite television station Al Arabiya said in one of the most striking of these commentaries. </p> <p> North Korea will show foreign diplomats as early as Tuesday the site of a mysterious explosion that it said was intended to blow up a mountain for a hydroelectric dam, British journalists reported Monday night from Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. </p> <p> Satellite photos of a mushroom cloud rising Thursday from a huge nighttime explosion raised international concern that North Korea had tested a nuclear bomb on Sept. 9, the 56th anniversary of its founding. There have been no reports of increased radiation releases from North Korea's neighbors, China, Russia or South Korea. </p> <p> With North Korea's nuclear threat flaring up this week, Senator John Kerry vowed in Philadelphia on Friday to get the talks about the country's weapons program ''back on track'' if elected president. </p> <p> In Vienna, the annual meeting of the 137-nation International Atomic Energy Agency ended Friday, saying it ''particularly welcomes'' multinational talks on North Korea. </p> <p> As New York and Washington were under attack on Sept. 11, 2001, a film crew happened to come upon John Kerry leaving the Capitol. The brief moment of footage, included in a BBC documentary called ''Clear the Skies,'' tells us something, perhaps, about Kerry in a crisis. The camera captures Congressional aides and visitors, clearly distraught and holding onto one another, streaming down the back steps of the Capitol building in near panic, following the bellowed instructions of anxious police. Off to one side of the screen, there is Kerry, alone, his long legs carrying him calmly down the steps, his neck craning toward the sky, as if he were watching a gathering rainstorm. His face and demeanor appear unworried. Kerry could be a man lost in his thoughts who just happens to have wandered onto the set of a disaster film. </p> <p> ''I remember looking up at the sky as I walked down the steps,'' Kerry told me recently, when I asked him about the film clip. He said that he and other members of the Senate's Democratic leadership had just watched on television as the second plane hit the World Trade Center, and shortly after that they heard the sonic boom of an explosion and saw, through a large window, the black smoke rise from the Pentagon. ''We'd had some warning that there was some airplane in the sky. And I remember seeing a great big plane -- I think it was a 747 or something -- up there, but it wasn't moving in a way that, you know, I was particularly concerned. I remember feeling a rage, a huge anger, and I remember turning to somebody and saying, 'This is war.' I said, 'This is an act of war.''' </p> <p> ''I'm angry that we find the U.N. proactively interfering with our investigation,'' Senator Norm Coleman, chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, informed Lou Dobbs on CNN, ''by telling certain folks not to cooperate with us.'' He repeated for emphasis his sharp response to Secretary General Kofi Annan's ''interfering with our ability to get information we need'' about the oil-for-food scandal. </p> <p> Judith Miller of The Times had revealed that the Minnesota Republican, joined by ranking Democrat Carl Levin, sent a letter noting Annan's four-month foot-dragging and that ''the U.N. is hindering our efforts to obtain relevant documents.'' </p> <p> Russia's most famous general arrived promptly at 10 a.m. The doors to the ceremonial chamber of a presidential palace swung open, and there he stood. He wore a green dress uniform with gold epaulets. Medals lined his chest. </p> <p> Everyone in the chamber stood. Mikhail T. Kalashnikov, the creator of the world's most widely distributed firearm, turned 85 on Wednesday, and here, in the once secretive Soviet city in the western Ural Mountains where he spent decades helping to refine and mass produce his product line, there was an extended pause to reflect. </p> <p> It seems as though building castles in the air and great utopias is a Russian specialty. Many Russians have long believed that we live in an ''improper'' country while the United States is a ''proper'' place, a nation with intelligent and decent government headed by a wise leader. I would like to think that the dashing of this myth in the last few years is an indicator of a certain degree of maturity. </p> <p> Little by little, we have begun to understand that the genius of today does not pursue politics; it manifests itself in other things: arts, science, etc. The world is ruled by ordinary people. There is nothing bad about that -- to the contrary, an ordinary person as a leader seems more befitting the spirit of democracy. By that light, John Kerry and George Bush seemed to me to be equals, ordinary men differing in style but not substance, a feeling that seems confirmed by Mr. Bush's small margin of victory. </p> <p> President Bush increased the administration's pressure on Iran on Saturday, saying there were indications that the country was speeding forward in its production of a key ingredient for nuclear weapons fuel, a move he said was ''a very serious matter'' that undercut Iran's denials that it was seeking to build weapons. </p> <p> On the first day here of the annual gathering of Pacific Rim leaders, his first summit meeting since winning re-election, Mr. Bush also tried to re-establish a unified front against the other nuclear challenge facing his second term: North Korea. </p> <p> Secretary of State Colin L. Powell opened a new drive on Thursday to enlist Russia, China, South Korea and Japan to press North Korea to rejoin talks aimed at ending its nuclear arms program, but American officials said they could not be sure when the talks would resume. </p> <p> A senior administration official, briefing reporters after Mr. Powell met with the Chinese foreign minister, Li Zhaoxing, said that recent indications from South Korea and others had been ''mildly encouraging'' that North Korea was committed to the regional talks but that no date for their resumption was in sight. </p> <p> Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, on the second day of a mission to strengthen security ties across Central and South America, received an unambiguous promise on Friday that Nicaragua would destroy all of its portable antiaircraft missiles supplied by the Soviet Union and Cuba during the 1980's. </p> <p> More than 2,000 of the shoulder-fired SA-7 missiles remained in the Nicaraguan arsenal at the start of this year, a potent remnant of a time when the former Sandinista government here received military assistance from the Communist world. </p> <p> The gun buy-back program in this old Siberian mining town works like similar programs anywhere else. </p> <p> There is a kitty of money. The local police put announcements in the newspaper, notifying residents that they will grant amnesty and pay small sums -- in this case up to about $17.25 in rubles -- to anyone who turns in an unregistered gun. </p> <p> Muhammad Shahrour, a layman who writes extensively about Islam, sits in his engineering office in Damascus, Syria, arguing that Muslims will untangle their faith from the increasingly gory violence committed in its name only by reappraising their sacred texts. </p> <p> First, Mr. Shahrour brazenly tackles the Koran. The entire ninth chapter, The Sura of Repentance, he says, describes a failed attempt by the Prophet Muhammad to form a state on the Arabian Peninsula. He believes that as the source of most of the verses used to validate extremist attacks, with lines like ''slay the pagans where you find them,'' the chapter should be isolated to its original context. </p> <p> Japan adopted plans Friday to shift its military focus away from the cold-war threat of invasion from the Soviet Union to guarding against missiles from North Korea and Chinese incursions around its southernmost islands. </p> <p> The new policy cuts tanks and artillery pieces by one-third, to about 600 of each, but greatly increases investment in missiles and forms a squadron of midair refueling planes to allow existing aircraft to attack North Korean missile sites and return home safely to Japan. </p> <p> Despite a renewed American effort to repair relations with Europe, a disagreement between the Bush administration and European leaders over how best to persuade Iran to abandon its suspected nuclear weapons program has deepened in recent weeks, diplomats on both sides say. </p> <p> The diplomats said the disagreement focused on what Europeans maintained was the crucial next step in their drive to persuade Iran to move beyond its recently agreed voluntary suspension of uranium enrichment activities to the point of abandoning them outright. </p> <p> The United States and Russia are close to signing an agreement to help control the trafficking of shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles, a weapon highly prized by terrorists, the Russian defense minister said during a visit here on Tuesday. </p> <p> The minister, Sergei B. Ivanov, said the deal had been negotiated rapidly during the past several months, and he predicted that ''this agreement is sure to be signed pretty soon.'' </p> <p> President Bush said Wednesday that the elections this weekend in Iraq would be ''a grand moment in Iraqi history'' that he described as part of a global march toward freedom. Yet he acknowledged that Iraqis themselves had not yet taken the initiative in defending their country and might doubt Washington's will to prevail against the insurgency. </p> <p> Mr. Bush's assessment, in the first news conference of his second term, was made on the deadliest day of the war for American forces. </p> <p> State Department and Pentagon officials are expressing renewed concern that Nicaragua may not destroy its arsenal of portable antiaircraft missiles as it promised Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld during his visit to Managua last autumn, administration officials said Tuesday. </p> <p> An American delegation was in Managua on Tuesday to renew pressure on the Nicaraguan government to destroy all of the shoulder-fired missiles supplied by the Soviet Union and Cuba during the 1980's. The American group was led by Rose Likins, the acting assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs. </p> <p> Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said Tuesday that he had instructed his government to begin coordinating with Palestinian leaders on Israel's planned withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. </p> <p> Mr. Sharon, who a year ago announced his intention to pull all Israeli settlers out of Gaza unilaterally, insisting he had no Palestinian partner while Yasir Arafat remained alive, expressed eagerness to work with his successor, Mahmoud Abbas, on returning Gaza to Palestinian control. Mr. Arafat died in November. </p> <p> Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld ratcheted up the war of words between the Bush administration and Venezuela's government on Wednesday, suggesting that the country's plans to buy 100,000 assault rifles from Russia could further destabilize an already tumultuous region. </p> <p> ''I can't imagine what's going to happen to 100,000 AK-47's,'' he said at a news conference in Brasília, the Brazilian capital, where he met with Brazil's vice president and defense minister, José Alencar. ''I can't imagine why Venezuela needs 100,000 AK-47's.'' </p> <p> The road is an aged dirt track running in a line across the Central Asian steppe, past grazing cattle and horses, arriving at a hillock overlooking a parched basin. </p> <p> There are no warning signs. There is no gate beside the abandoned guard shack at the remains of the fence. Only the climbing numbers on the radiation detector suggest that perhaps it would be best to turn around. </p> <p> Saudi Arabia told Syria on Thursday to withdraw its troops from Lebanon, adding substantially to Syria's international isolation just a day after Russia joined Western nations in making a similar call. </p> <p> Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, went Thursday to Riyadh, the Saudi capital, hoping to secure Saudi support before a coming Arab summit meeting. But Saudi officials told Reuters and The Associated Press that Crown Prince Abdullah had delivered an unusually blunt rebuff. Egypt, the other key Arab player, has also called for the withdrawal of Syria from Lebanon. </p> <p> Yuri Baluyevsky, Russia's top general, outlined plans with Chinese officials this week for the first joint military exercises between the countries and played down concerns that they could further aggravate rising regional tensions. </p> <p> General Baluyevsky, speaking Thursday during the first day of his four-day China visit, said the war games reflected the countries' shared desire to develop closer strategic military ties and were ''not targeted at any third country,'' according to Chinese state news media. </p> <p> After two senior-level meetings between North Korean and Chinese leaders over the last two weeks to discuss the North's nuclear-weapons program, the Chinese have failed so far to persuade North Korea to rejoin nuclear disarmament talks, senior administration officials and diplomats said Friday. </p> <p> As a result of the continuing deadlock, informal discussions have begun among the five parties to the talks on new, more aggressive strategies that could be used if and when it is decided that the talks have reached a dead end. </p> <p> The man carrying the hidden radioactive material passed among airline passengers at Sheremetyevo Airport here on an afternoon this year. His briefcase, holding the contraband, was indistinguishable from anyone else's carry-on bag. </p> <p> Then, as he approached the check-in counter, lights flashed and an alarm sounded. A mounted video camera captured the man's image. Uniformed guards seized the briefcase and took it to a lead-lined booth where it could be inspected without harming other passengers. </p> <p> The Bush administration said Wednesday that it would send 55,000 tons of food to North Korea this year, even as other American officials press ahead with plans to deprive the North of hard currency if there is no progress in efforts to end its nuclear weapons program. </p> <p> The food aid, the same amount as last year, was announced just as China, South Korea, Japan, Russia and the United States are trying to lure North Korea back to talks that have been stalled for a year. But a State Department spokesman, Adam Ereli, said in announcing the decision that there was no linkage to the nuclear issue. ''Our decisions are made on humanitarian considerations solely,'' he told reporters. </p> <p> THE hospital's diagnoses, many years old, are Fyodor Sozontov's backup plan. They can, he hopes, prove that something is wrong with him. </p> <p> He reads them out slowly, the medical conditions too difficult to pronounce easily: osteochondrosis, arachnoiditis and cerebral angiodystonia. Still, the draft board was skeptical. During his first visit, obligatory for all boys in secondary school, the officers declared him fit for military service. </p> <p> President Bush criticized Senate Democrats on Tuesday for ''stalling'' a vote on John R. Bolton's nomination as ambassador to the United Nations, and indicated that he would not grant them access to intelligence documents they have demanded to see before allowing the confirmation to go ahead. </p> <p> Mr. Bush's statements, at a news conference in the Rose Garden, suggested that he was intent on winning the battle over Mr. Bolton on his own terms when the Senate reconvenes next week, rather than negotiating a deal with Democrats and some Republicans who have been advocating a compromise. </p> <p> Russia, China and four Central Asian states called Tuesday for the United States to set a deadline for withdrawing from military bases in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. </p> <p> The wording in their declaration, made by members of a regional alliance known as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, was veiled but clear, and it marked anew the shifting diplomatic ground in Central Asia since mid-May, when Uzbekistan used gunfire to put down an uprising and antigovernment demonstration in Andijon. </p> <p> The Bush administration appeared to show signs of new flexibility in talks with North Korea on Tuesday, with American and North Korean diplomats meeting here at length to discuss the delicate question of how aid or energy assistance may be provided to the North as it begins the process of dismantling its nuclear weapons program. </p> <p> Delegations from the two countries met alone here for the second straight day to discuss a proposal the administration put forward in June 2004 before North Korea walked away from talks. Christopher R. Hill, who is leading the American delegation, told reporters that the ''businesslike'' meeting again raised the prospect of a three-month ''freeze'' period on North Korea's nuclear activity, followed by a rapid dismantlement of their nuclear plants. In return, the aid spigot from South Korea and other neighbors would begin to open wider. </p> <p> Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld arrived in this Central Asian nation on Monday to shore up an unsettled military basing arrangement that has been critical to operations in Afghanistan. </p> <p> The refueling and cargo mission operated by the American military from Manas Air Base, just outside Bishkek, the capital, has been an essential link in the supply chain for moving aid to civilians, troops and equipment into and out of Afghanistan. About 1,000 American troops operate from the airfield, which is the base for nine KC-135 refueling jets and C-130 cargo planes. </p> <p> Negotiators from the United States and North Korea held a rare, private meeting on Monday, underscoring the heightened stakes and grave concerns surrounding the six-nation talks on the North Korean nuclear crisis that opened here on Tuesday. </p> <p> The United States envoy, Christopher R. Hill, played down his 75-minute afternoon meeting with the North Koreans, and American officials in Beijing provided few details of the meeting. But in Washington, the State Department spokesman, Sean McCormack, described the meeting as ''businesslike'' and said that ''they were able to compare notes about how the talks might move forward.'' </p> <p> North Korea on Wednesday criticized an American plan to defuse the nuclear crisis, saying the proposal demands too many steps toward dismantling the country's nuclear program before providing any corresponding aid or energy assistance, a senior United States official said in a background meeting with reporters. </p> <p> North Korea's criticism of the American plan, first proposed in June 2004 before the talks broke off, was not unexpected, noted the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the private nature of the discussions. But it underscored the ''fundamental differences'' between the countries as participants in the six-nation nuclear talks took on the difficult task of finding common ground to resolve the crisis, now in its third year. </p> <p> Iran on Tuesday rejected calls by European leaders to halt its renewed nuclear activities, but indicated a willingness to continue negotiations over its program, perhaps by offering a proposal of its own. </p> <p> ''There is no reason to suspend this activity,'' Sirus Naser, Iran's chief delegate to the International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters after an emergency meeting here of the agency's governing board on the matter. </p> <p> An American Congressional delegation was delayed at a provincial airport in Russia on Sunday as its members tried to leave the country, in an unexplained breach of protocol. </p> <p> The delegation's aircraft departed only after entreaties from the State Department resolved a dispute over the group's travels, said Courtney Austrian, a spokeswoman for the American Embassy. </p> <p> The value of military weapons sales worldwide jumped in 2004 to the highest level since 2000, driven by arms deals with developing nations, especially India, Saudi Arabia and China, according to a new Congressional study. </p> <p> The total of arms sales and weapons transfer agreements to both industrialized and developing nations was nearly $37 billion in 2004, according to the study. </p> <p> Negotiators meeting Monday for the seventh consecutive day about the North Korean nuclear program reported no progress as the six participating nations struggled to draft a joint statement of principles that would push the disarmament process forward. </p> <p> Christopher R. Hill, the lead American negotiator, arrived at his hotel late Monday after a day in which his delegation held private talks with the North Koreans and representatives of the other four nations. </p> <p> China and Russia will hold their most ambitious joint military exercises beginning Thursday, with naval ships, bombers, fighter planes and 10,000 troops massing on China's northeast coast for maneuvers that the two countries say will show their deepening cooperation. </p> <p> They say the exercise is not intended to threaten other countries, but to improve the ability of China and Russia to thwart terrorism and separatist uprisings on their borders. But the focus of those concerns is in Central Asia, while the exercises will be on the Pacific coast, 3,000 miles away. Energy and regional tensions exist in northeast Asia, however, and the display of mutual political trust between China and Russia may be more important than the military training involved, specialists in Russian and Chinese relations said. </p> <p> The special police unit arrived in the darkness, carrying submachine guns and taking positions around an unmarked cargo truck parked beside a nuclear reactor. The doors to the reactor swung open and a forklift hurried three large steel casks onto the truck. </p> <p> Each container held several fuel rods of highly enriched uranium, potent enough for use in a nuclear bomb. </p> <p> Iran has resumed converting uranium despite European requests that it abstain from such work pending a new round of negotiations on its nuclear activities, a diplomat close to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna said Thursday. </p> <p> The reported resumption of activity, at a nuclear plant in Isfahan, comes days after Iran appeared to rebuff a European proposal that would allow Iran do some converting of uranium into a natural gas at the plant provided the product made there would be sent outside the country, presumably to Russia, for the final processing that would allow it to be used to generate power. </p> <p> The United States and Europe will not seek a referral this week of their case against Iran to the United Nations Security Council, American and European diplomats said Tuesday. Instead, the diplomats said, they will allow more time for China, Russia, India and other countries to persuade Iran to stop its nuclear activities. </p> <p> The diplomats said they were convinced that Iran was becoming more isolated from other countries as a result of recent statements and actions, including threats to kick out inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency and to resume enrichment of uranium. </p> <p> The Bush administration and three European allies have approved a new offer to be made to Iran in a last-ditch effort to head off a confrontation over its suspected nuclear weapons program. </p> <p> The proposal would permit Iran to conduct very limited nuclear activities on its own soil, but would move the process of enriching all of its uranium to Russia, American and European officials said. </p> <p> TODAY the Supreme Court justices are expected to debate whether they will hear a case involving a Yemeni named Salim Ahmed Hamdan, who is accused of being Osama bin Laden's driver. A federal appeals court found that Mr. Hamdan, who was captured in Afghanistan in 2001 and is being held at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba, was not entitled to the protections of the Geneva Conventions; he has appealed to the high court. </p> <p> If the court does not choose to review the appellate court's decision, and then overturn it, America's national security will be endangered. I say that based on my experience as the senior American intelligence officer during the final three years of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan (1986 to 1989). And I also feel that our intelligence agencies and military commanders should make clear to the Bush administration that our country's most fundamental commitments of humanitarian treatment have long been extended to the Afghan battlefield. </p> <p> Russia has agreed to sell antiaircraft missiles to Iran as part of a $1 billion arms deal that would significantly increase Moscow's military cooperation with Tehran, Russian news media reported Friday. </p> <p> The announcement of the sale coincided with a visit to Moscow by R. Nicholas Burns, the American under secretary of state for political affairs, who said in a radio interview that the United States had asked the Russian Foreign Ministry to explain the deal, reported by the newspaper Vedomosti and the Interfax news agency. </p> <p> It has all the makings of a James Bond movie: an isolated authoritarian regime running a secret counterfeiting network with tentacles reaching into foreign banks, the Irish Republican Army and Chinese underworld gangs dealing in narcotics and antiaircraft missiles. </p> <p> This is the picture of North Korea that former American officials and analysts say Washington has pieced together in recent years as it has investigated the appearance around the world of bogus $100 bills so perfect that they have been called ''supernotes.'' </p> <p> Iran announced Monday that it had postponed talks on letting Russia enrich its uranium, a proposal that Russia had offered as a way to resolve the dispute over Iran's nuclear ambitions. </p> <p> Iran also signaled that it was resuming the enrichment of uranium at one of its main nuclear sites, according to diplomats close to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. </p> <p> A Russian effort to forge a compromise over Iran's nuclear program stalled Monday after five hours of talks in the Kremlin ended inconclusively. Negotiators for both countries agreed to hold new talks but did not announce when or where. </p> <p> The discussions, already delayed several days, focused on the details of Russia's offer to set up a joint venture to enrich uranium in Russia for Iran's nuclear fuel. </p> <p> The Bush administration will propose in its budget on Monday the creation of an atomic energy partnership with Russia, offering countries a supply of fuel for their reactors under restrictions intended to prevent them from developing nuclear weapons, according to administration officials. </p> <p> Under the proposal, the United States and Russia would provide reactor fuel to other countries and take back the spent fuel afterward to prevent its use in weaponry. President Bush called for a similar plan two years ago, and the International Atomic Energy Agency has recommended an international fuel system in which it would control custody of nuclear fuel. </p> <p> A second day of negotiations between Iran and Russia ended Tuesday without evident progress, amid signs of increasing frustration here over the unsuccessful efforts to break a diplomatic impasse over Iran's nuclear programs. </p> <p> After a brief resumption of talks in the morning at the Foreign Ministry, Iran's side left Moscow, having refused to consider a new moratorium on nuclear research, which Russia has demanded in an exchange for a joint venture to enrich Iran's uranium on Russian soil, according to diplomats and news accounts. </p> <p> Ivan's War  Life and Death in the Red Army, 1939-1945  By Catherine Merridale  Illustrated. 462 pages. Metropolitan Books. $30. </p> <p> Like the United States, the Soviet Union has its greatest generation. Between 1941 and 1945, 30 million men and women served in the Soviet military, facing almost certain defeat at the outset but eventually rolling on to victory in Berlin. The toll was catastrophic, the numbers almost impossible to fathom: two and a half million soldiers captured in the first five months of the war, more than eight million killed by war's end. ''They called us, they trained us, they killed us,'' one veteran put it succinctly. </p> <p> The 35-nation board of the United Nations atomic energy agency voted here on Saturday to report Iran to the Security Council, a move that reflects increasing suspicion around the world that Iran is determined to develop nuclear weapons. </p> <p> The resolution, which passed by a vote of 27 to 3, could change the course of diplomacy toward Iran and open the door to international punishment of the country. </p> <p> The Bush administration and Russia, struggling to forge a joint strategy on Iran, remain at odds over whether the United Nations Security Council should take a step toward imposing penalties on Iran by labeling its nuclear activities a threat to world peace, American and European officials say. </p> <p> The officials say that the Russian-American impasse, in which leading European countries are siding with the Bush administration, has held up what the West had hoped would be a unanimous move by the Security Council on Iran this month. The impasse also has echoes of the Iraq war, they say, in that Russia is concerned about a possible replay of the United States' using resolutions by the Council to confront Iran in the same way it acted against Iraq. </p> <p> Captured Iraqi documents describe a Russian spy operation that was aimed at the United States Central Command in the early days of the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, according to a new American military report. The report says information on war plans and troop movements was passed through the Russian ambassador in Baghdad. </p> <p> Revelation of the operation, contained in the public version of a Joint Forces Command classified study, the Iraqi Perspectives Project, may have more political than military significance because American forces overwhelmed the underequipped and poorly led Iraqi Army to oust Saddam Hussein. </p> <p> Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Sunday that the United States would seek clarification from Russia of an American military report that it had helped pass information to Iraq before the 2003 invasion, but she declined to make any specific allegations about Russian involvement. </p> <p> ''I don't have any reason to doubt or confirm the report at this point,'' Ms. Rice said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' ''I do think we have to look at the documents and look very carefully.'' </p> <p> German prosecutors are investigating whether six German companies sold electronic equipment to a clandestine procurement network established to supply Iran with equipment for its nuclear development program. </p> <p> A prosecutor in the state of Brandenberg, Benedikt Welfens, told German television on Monday that several million dollars' worth of equipment that could be used for a nuclear program had been shipped from Germany to Iran, via a Russian company that operated in Berlin in 2003 and 2004. </p> <p> European and American diplomats circulated a new draft statement to the Security Council on Tuesday evening that weakens language condemning Iran's nuclear program but still calls on Tehran to abandon uranium enrichment activities, which the West believes are intended to make weapons. </p> <p> The new draft, written by Britain and France and supported by the United States, eliminates or softens elements in earlier drafts that had raised objections from China and Russia. </p> <p> Vice President Dick Cheney declared Tuesday that the United Nations Security Council would ''impose meaningful consequences'' on Iran if it proceeded with uranium enrichment activities, and the Bush administration put an end to talk of compromise with Iran as floated by Russia. </p> <p> But the administration's tough language pressing the Tehran government to return to a suspension of its enrichment program left unclear what the Security Council would do when it takes up Iran's case next week. The administration's goal is to win consent for a statement by the Security Council president calling on Iran to cooperate with the demand for a freeze on its nuclear activities. </p> <p> There are times when even a little bit of research can be a bad thing, especially if it centers on Iran and the bomb. </p> <p> On Tuesday, a wide range of nuclear scientists and analysts faulted as dangerous Moscow's tentative proposal to let Tehran do small amounts of research on uranium enrichment, with some comparing it to being a little bit pregnant. </p> <p> The top envoys in the six-nation talks over North Korea's nuclear arms program gathered here on Monday for an academic conference on international security, but prospects that the long-stalled negotiations would resume appeared low. </p> <p> Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said upon his arrival here that he had no plans to meet his North Korean counterpart, Kim Kye Gwan. ''I am not planning to request a bilateral meeting,'' Mr. Hill told reporters, ''and to my knowledge they have not requested it either.'' </p> <p> President Bush said Monday that he remained committed to using diplomacy to block Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, his first public comments addressing recent speculation that the United States was weighing military action to do so. </p> <p> The president, taking questions from an audience at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University, dismissed reports published over the weekend that described military planning for attacks against Iran, saying they contained ''wild speculation.'' Reports in The Washington Post and The New Yorker magazine, outlining military plans, said the United States had not ruled out using nuclear weapons against underground nuclear sites in Iran. </p> <p> The United States National Nuclear Security Administration said Wednesday that it had completed the removal of about 139 pounds of weapons-grade nuclear fuel from a small reactor in Uzbekistan and transferred the material to a secure storage site in Russia. </p> <p> The transfer, completed in secrecy late Wednesday in Chelyabinsk, Russia, was the first return of spent fuel from a reactor in a former Soviet republic to Russia, where the fuel originated during the Soviet era. Previous transfers have involved fresh reactor fuel, which is easier to handle. </p> <p> A one-day trip to Iran by the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, ended Thursday night with no agreement by the Iranians to halt their production of enriched uranium. And European diplomats said Iran had shown inspectors evidence that they were preparing to double the size of their small-scale production facilities within weeks. </p> <p> Before Dr. ElBaradei's arrival, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran issued a taunt meant to erase any doubts about whether Iran was determined to plunge ahead with its fuel-making facilities in defiance of a warning from the United Nations. </p> <p> The Bush administration, seeking to enlist Russian support for a United Nations Security Council resolution on Iran, has agreed to language ruling out the immediate threat of military force, American and European officials said Tuesday. </p> <p> The American agreement has improved the chances that the Russians will go along with the resolution, European diplomats said. </p> <p> The United States, Britain and France have drafted a binding United Nations Security Council resolution requiring Iran to stop critical nuclear activities, but Russia and China are resisting, officials involved in the negotiations said Tuesday. </p> <p> The emerging standoff signals the beginning of a new confrontation that is expected to take weeks to negotiate, and even then might not result in a clear outcome. </p> <p> IN recent months, Iran has pursued defiance as if it were a virtue, declaring itself a member of the nuclear club, curtailing cooperation with international nuclear inspectors and rejecting calls by the United Nations to drop its nuclear enrichment program. </p> <p> Should the rest of the international community give up on negotiations and take another path, either sanctions or the military options that have been bandied around in Washington? Maybe -- but maybe there is also an opportunity to get Iran back to the negotiating table. </p> <p> It did not take long for the European Union's border experts to spot evidence of the shadowy trade on Ukraine's notoriously porous border with Moldova. It came in an unexpected form, though: Tyson frozen chicken. </p> <p> ''Every time, leg quarters,'' Torsten Spehr, a German border officer, said at this border crossing with Moldova's self-declared separatist region, Transnistria. </p> <p> The Bush administration is moving to establish a new antimissile site in Europe that would be designed to stop attacks by Iran against the United States and its European allies. </p> <p> The administration's proposal, which comes amid rising concerns about Iran's suspected program to develop nuclear weapons, calls for installing 10 antimissile interceptors at a European site by 2011. Poland and the Czech Republic are among the nations under consideration. </p> <p> The Bush administration on Wednesday rejected calls for a direct dialogue with Iran over its nuclear program and declared that the United States had taken steps toward closing differences with Europe, China and Russia on a package of incentives and threats of punishment for the Iranian government. </p> <p> After a day of talks in London on a package intended to persuade Iran to give up its uranium enrichment program, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said more work needed to be done in coming days or weeks. </p> <p> Mansour is Baghdad's Upper East Side. It has fancy pastry shops, jewelry stores, a designer furniture boutique and an elite social club. </p> <p> But it is no longer the address everyone wants. </p> <p> Bush administration officials said on Wednesday that the package of incentives offered to Iran could theoretically allow it to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes someday, but expressed severe doubts that Iran could satisfy the conditions that would allow it to do so. </p> <p> The decision to leave that possibility open amounts to a significant shift in United States policy, because President Bush has repeatedly said that he would not allow Iran to produce nuclear fuel or to gain the knowledge necessary to build a weapon. He has insisted that all nuclear fuel for Iranian power production come from outside Iran. </p> <p> Iran's foreign minister said Saturday that the government would issue a counteroffer to an incentive proposal by Europe, China and the United States to persuade Iran to give up enriching uranium in the short term. </p> <p> The foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, confirmed that Iran had received the proposal and would offer its own. ''We hope that through shuttle diplomacy we can give our proposal in the form of amendment or package after it is finalized to the other side for examination,'' he said, according to the ISNA news agency. </p> <p> YOU know you're a frequent flier when you wake up and don't remember where you are. You have to look at the hotel phone to figure it out. I've had to do that a time or two. </p> <p> But as a war correspondent, my first question in the morning isn't, ''where am I?'' It is: ''safe or not safe?'' </p> <p> The Bush administration said Wednesday that the United States would join Europeans in talks with Iran over its nuclear program, but only if Tehran first suspended its uranium activities, which are thought to be a cover for developing nuclear arms. </p> <p> The declaration, by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, was a shift away from decades of refusal to hold broad, direct talks with Iran. But Iran has long said it would not agree to preconditions, and the administration's offer appeared to be aimed as much at placating American allies as at wooing Iran. </p> <p> AS the world watches the political maneuvering over restarting nuclear talks with Iran -- this time with American participation -- few are paying attention to a broader strategic competition that has started between the United States, Russia and China. Ultimately, this competition will decide not only the direction of Iran's nuclear activities but also its economic, political and military role in the Middle East and beyond. The outcome hinges on which countries will assume dominance in developing Iran's enormous oil and natural gas reserves. </p> <p> Unfortunately, by refusing to consider a ''grand bargain'' with Iran -- that is, resolution of Washington's concerns about Tehran's weapons of mass destruction and support for terrorism in return for American security guarantees, an end to sanctions and normalization of diplomatic relations -- the Bush administration is courting failure in its nuclear diplomacy and paving the way for Russia and China to win the larger strategic contest. </p> <p> The success or failure of the international initiative to curb Iran's nuclear program hinges largely on an ostensibly clear-cut request: before talks can begin, Tehran must freeze all activities related to the enrichment of uranium. </p> <p> But while that demand seems surgically precise, what it actually means is unclear. It has become the subject of anxious diplomacy around the world -- a sort of prenegotiation negotiation -- centered on finding a definition that the Iranians and the six countries behind the initiative can accept. The results will determine if the talks move ahead or fail before they formally start. </p> <p> President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on Friday defied pressure from foreign leaders to accept a package of incentives in return for ending all nuclear activities, saying Iran will pursue its legal right to develop a peaceful nuclear program. </p> <p> ''Any pressure to deprive our people from their right will not bear any fruit,'' he was quoted as saying on state-run television. </p> <p> Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld told a gathering of defense experts here on Saturday that Iran was ''one of the leading terrorist nations in the world.'' </p> <p> Mr. Rumsfeld also questioned why Russia and China would allow Iran to participate in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a regional organization that includes Russia, China and Central Asian nations. </p> <p> The Bush administration said Saturday that it would open formal negotiations with Russia on a long-discussed civilian nuclear agreement that would pave the way for Russia to become one of the world's largest repositories of spent nuclear fuel. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin has been looking to expand the country's role in the multibillion nuclear power business. The United States has traditionally opposed any such arrangement, in part because of concerns about the safety of Russian nuclear facilities, and because the country has helped Iran build its first major nuclear reactor. </p> <p> The American military is investigating accusations that soldiers raped an Iraqi woman in her home and killed her and three family members, including a child, American officials said Friday. </p> <p> The investigation is the fourth into suspected killings of unarmed Iraqis by American soldiers announced by the military in June. In May, it was disclosed that the military was conducting an inquiry into the deaths of 24 civilians in Haditha last November. </p> <p> The Bush administration has tried to ignore North Korea, then, reluctantly, to engage it, and then to squeeze its bankers in a manner intended to make the country's leader, Kim Jong Il, personally feel the pinch. </p> <p> Yet none of these steps in the past six years has worked. So now, after a barrage of missile launchings by North Korea, President Bush and his national security advisers found themselves on Wednesday facing what one close aide described as an array of ''familiar bad choices.'' </p> <p> The Bush administration tried Wednesday to build international support for stronger measures, including sanctions, to persuade North Korea to abandon its weapons program after it fired a seventh missile into the Sea of Japan. But China and Russia resisted, saying they favored less punitive actions. </p> <p> ''I strongly believe that it is much more effective to have more than one nation dealing with North Korea,'' President Bush said a few hours after the North followed its six-missile barrage of the previous day with a seventh missile launching. </p> <p> Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld said here Sunday that while the fledgling United States ballistic missile defense system was becoming more capable, he wanted to see a successful full-scale test before declaring it able to shoot down a ballistic missile. </p> <p> ''I have a lot of confidence in these folks, and I have a lot of confidence in the work that's been done,'' Mr. Rumsfeld said after touring one of the system's two interceptor sites. But he added that he wanted to see a test ''where we actually put all the pieces together; that just hasn't happened.'' </p> <p> It is becoming clear now what happened New Year's Day in the barracks of the Chelyabinsk Tank Academy, when the Russian military's singular means of enforcing discipline claimed its most famous victim. </p> <p> The details are trickling out in a windowless courtroom here in a trial that has illustrated the darkest aspects of Russian military service and exposed the commanders' refusal to address them, despite public pledges to the contrary. </p> <p> Despite suspicions that Iran is intimately involved in the current conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the Bush administration has carefully stopped short of accusing Iran of inciting the crisis. </p> <p> President Bush has said on several occasions that he believes Iran has armed and encouraged Hezbollah, a Shiite militia operating from southern Lebanon, and is fomenting terrorism in the Middle East and elsewhere through proxies like Hezbollah. But he has shied away from words or actions that could spark an open confrontation with Iran. </p> <p> In about two weeks, the final trainload of radioactive waste is to leave the Fernald nuclear site. </p> <p> The train will carry 5,800 tons of contaminated soil in 60 railcars, just like the 196 trains before it, which have run for seven years to a Utah dump from this scarred, cratered patch of land in the hills of southern Ohio. </p> <p> Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief, said Thursday that ''some important progress'' had been made in two days of talks over resolving Iran's nuclear ambitions and that more talks would be held next week. </p> <p> ''We have had the opportunity of being together for several hours and of working with great intensity,'' Mr. Solana said after the talks with Ali Larijani, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator. ''We have made some important progress on the elements related to how the potential negotiations can take place.'' </p> <p> When Vice President Dick Cheney came to this oil-rich Central Asian nation this spring he expressed admiration for what he called its ''political development.'' Yet just a day before his visit began, the authoritarian government effectively shut down the two most prominent American democracy organizations working here. </p> <p> While American officials are negotiating to reverse the government's decision, they have yet to complain about it publicly. </p> <p> Five nations in Central Asia signed a nuclear-free-zone treaty on Friday that commits the region's rich uranium deposits to peaceful uses but leaves open loopholes that could allow Russia to transport nuclear weapons into Central Asia. </p> <p> It is the first mutual security pact among all five Central Asian nations, a group that has often quarreled about security issues. </p> <p> As eras go, the post-cold war has been a pretty good one. The collapse of communism, the spread of free-market democracies and the general reign of stability bought and paid for by U.S. power all combined to create a world in which China and India have been able to rise peacefully, America has prospered, and Europe has become whole and free. Yes, there's been 9/11, Bosnia, the rise of the petro-dictators and African wars -- which are hardly trivial. But all in all, compared with the vast repression and nuclear standoff that characterized the cold war, the post-cold-war era has been much better for a lot of humanity. </p> <p> Too bad it's probably over. </p> <p> Russia surpassed the United States in 2005 as the leader in weapons deals with the developing world, and its new agreements included selling $700 million in surface-to-air missiles to Iran and eight new aerial refueling tankers to China, according to a new Congressional study. </p> <p> Those weapons deals were part of the highly competitive global arms bazaar in the developing world that grew to $30.2 billion in 2005, up from $26.4 billion in 2004. It is a market that the United States has regularly dominated. </p> <p> Until just over two months ago, the Kodori Gorge was a far-flung outpost where local militiamen ruled and its 2,500 residents lived simple but isolated lives, growing grapes and tending pigs far from the government's concerns. </p> <p> But with Georgia locked in a bitter struggle to control the mountainous regions south of Russia, the gorge is rapidly being transformed. The militia has been run off by government soldiers. New schools, homes and government buildings have been built, courtesy of the Georgian government. The area has even been given a new name: Upper Abkhazia. </p> <p> The commander of United States military activities in Latin America said Monday that Venezuela under President Hugo Chávez had become a destabilizing force, and that other countries in the Western hemisphere shared that concern. </p> <p> The commander, Gen. Bantz J. Craddock of the Army, said, ''What I have heard in the last few months is more concern by more countries'' about an increase in Venezuela's purchase of weapons, especially small arms. </p> <p> Russia deported 153 citizens of Georgia on Friday as a wave of punitive measures against Georgian migrants and businesses grew, prompting criticism that the government is carrying out an ethnically motivated campaign of harassment. </p> <p> The deportations came at the end of a week of political and diplomatic conflict between Russia and Georgia that began with the arrests of four Russian military officers for espionage, and has shown little sign of easing despite the officers' release. </p> <p> The United States and China spoke in a unified voice on Friday to call for the resumption of six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program, but they did not announce concrete steps to increase pressure on the North Korean government. </p> <p> Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said she had been told by the Chinese government that a special envoy sent by Beijing to North Korea had delivered ''a strong message.'' And the Chinese foreign minister, standing beside Ms. Rice, pledged his nation's commitment to breaking the stalemate over the North's nuclear weapons program. </p> <p> The former Russian spy who fell gravely ill early this month, apparently after being poisoned, died Thursday night after suffering a heart attack, the authorities said. </p> <p> But the circumstances leading to the death of the former spy, 43-year-old Alexander V. Litvinenko, remained murky and confused. Although the police initially said the case was one of ''deliberate poisoning,'' on Thursday they said only that they were investigating the matter as ''an unexplained death.'' Doctors at University College Hospital, where Mr. Litvinenko was being treated and which announced the death, said they still did not know why he had fallen so ill. </p> <p> The case of the poisoned former K.G.B. agent took a bizarre twist when British Airways said that traces of radiation had been detected Wednesday on jets that flew between London and Moscow, establishing a possible Russian link and indicating that more than 30,000 people might have been exposed to the radiation. </p> <p> The airline said tests had found ''very low traces'' of radioactivity so far on two of three Boeing 767s, which were singled out because the police suspected that passengers included people linked to the investigation. At least one of the planes flew between London and Moscow days before the former agent, Alexander V. Litvinenko, fell ill from the radioactive poison, polonium 210, that doctors say killed him. </p> <p> The British police said Sunday that they were investigating the suspected poisoning of Alexander V. Litvinenko, a Russian former K.G.B. operative living in exile in Britain who had been inquiring into the killing of a journalist in Moscow last month. </p> <p> The Russian authorities had no immediate comment on suggestions in news reports that the Russian secret service had poisoned Mr. Litvinenko, who is hospitalized and seriously ill, because he had criticized former colleagues and President Vladimir V. Putin. </p> <p> Three people complaining of symptoms consistent with the radiation poisoning that killed a former Russian spy last week have been sent to a special clinic here for further tests, the authorities said on Monday. </p> <p> They would not elaborate on the symptoms and said it would take a week before they knew whether the three had been exposed to polonium 210, the radioactive isotope found in the urine of the former spy, Alexander Litvinenko. But they said the danger to the public was minimal. </p> <p> In a series of closed-door meetings on the edges of the economic summit meeting of Asian nations here, President Bush and his aides have signaled that they will dangle a new set of incentives for North Korea to give up nuclear weapons and technology, American officials said. But the offers would hinge on the North's coming to talks next month agreeing to begin immediately dismantling some of the equipment it is using to build an arsenal. </p> <p> The stepped up diplomatic effort was made as Mr. Bush met leaders of the four countries that surround North Korea for the first time since the North conducted a nuclear test on Oct. 9. The meetings included a warm session with Japan's new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and a frosty one with the South Korean president, Roh Moo-hyun. </p> <p> Since 1993, when Robert M. Gates left Washington after completing 14 months as head of the Central Intelligence Agency saying it was ''time to get a life,'' he has recalled the capital's clashing egos and the news media's magnifying glass less than fondly. </p> <p> Mr. Gates has kept his distance, basking in the tranquillity of a lakefront house near Seattle and then in the homespun rituals of Texas A&M University, where he has served as president since 2002. He has recalled the public battering he took in two Senate confirmation hearings as ''unpredictable, frustrating, exhausting, insulting, humiliating'' -- in short, ''a lot like a root canal.'' </p> <p> The British authorities said Saturday that they did not expect a major threat to public health after the disclosure that a former K.G.B. officer and enemy of the Kremlin had been killed by radiation poisoning in London. </p> <p> The Health Protection Agency, however, urged people who had been in the same places as the victim, Alexander V. Litvinenko, 43, to contact the authorities for urine tests. </p> <p> Communism is gone and democracy is well implanted in the countries of the old Warsaw Pact, but the Soviet era's security services are still sending shudders through the region nearly two decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall. </p> <p> The case of Alexander V. Litvinenko, the former K.G.B. agent who was poisoned in London in November, would not seem out of place here, where a death threat in Romania, a suicide in Bulgaria and unbroken silence on several unsolved murders provide clues to the continued presence of the secret services today. </p> <p> Talks to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program ended Friday without tangible progress, and Pyongyang quickly renewed threats to ''improve its nuclear deterrent.'' </p> <p> American and Asian diplomats said that during five days of negotiations in Beijing, the North Korean delegation had declined to discuss disarmament in formal sessions, insisting it would do so only after the United States removed financial measures that have further isolated North Korea from the international economy. </p> <p> Islamic militants are using a recent peace deal with the government to consolidate their hold in northern Pakistan, vastly expanding their training of suicide bombers and other recruits and fortifying alliances with Al Qaeda and foreign fighters, diplomats and intelligence officials from several nations say. The result, they say, is virtually a Taliban mini-state. </p> <p> The militants, the officials say, are openly flouting the terms of the September accord in North Waziristan, under which they agreed to end cross-border help for the Taliban insurgency that revived in Afghanistan with new force this year. </p> <p> With gradations of unease rather than outrage inspired by the hanging of Saddam Hussein, Western politicians sought a cautious balance on Saturday between revulsion at his record, support for his executioners and concern at the use of a capital penalty they largely shun in their own countries. </p> <p> But religious leaders -- Christian and Muslim -- used stronger and more critical language in response to the news of Mr. Hussein's execution, which greeted most Western Europeans on their breakfast time news shows and in some newspaper headlines two days before the New Year. </p> <p> Mario Scaramella first claimed to have been hit with five times the lethal dose of polonium 210, the radioactive substance that killed the former Russian spy Alexander V. Litvinenko. ''I'm not in the best mood,'' he said in an interview with Italian television from his hospital bed in London last month. </p> <p> Then two days ago, he walked out of the hospital with minute traces of radioactive poisoning but was otherwise perfectly fine. </p> <p> Europeans produced a revised draft of a Security Council resolution on Iran on Friday, and said they would formally introduce it on Monday in the hope of obtaining a speedy vote on much-delayed action to curb Tehran's nuclear program. </p> <p> The text was drawn up after weeks of meetings in European capitals among the three nations drafting the measure, Britain, France and Germany, in consultation with the United States. It is aimed at meeting persistent objections from China and Russia. </p> <p> The chief American envoy to talks on North Korea's nuclear weapons program said Monday morning that he hoped a new round of six-nation negotiations would get under way shortly, and he expressed cautious optimism about prospects for reaching a settlement. </p> <p> The envoy, Christopher R. Hill, an assistant secretary of state, told reporters after consultations with the Chinese in Beijing that he felt there was a new ''basis for making progress.'' He said China, the host of the talks, may announce the start date for a new session shortly. </p> <p> THIS week the United States government will begin automatically declassifying hundreds of millions of documents from the cold war, under a law meant to streamline the cost and hassle of keeping secret files that are more than 25 years old. Among the dossiers bearing names like Alger Hiss, Theodore Hall and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg will be one labeled ''Frigyes Klein'': my father, Fred Klein. </p> <p> My father was never a spy, never a member of the Communist Party. He came by ship to the United States in 1956, fleeing Communism during the Hungarian revolution to pursue the American dream. He worked on a Ford automobile assembly line in Cincinnati by day and moonlighted sharpening lawnmowers at night, saving enough money in a few years to buy a small house. To him, treasonous behavior meant buying a car made outside of America. Nonetheless, as I discovered recently, the F.B.I. kept a file on him from the day he arrived in the United States. </p> <p> Russian intelligence officials placed the country on an unusual high alert on Tuesday night, appealing to citizens for vigilance and saying that the government had been informed by ''foreign partners'' of a possible terrorist act. </p> <p> The warning was at once detailed and vague. Issued at the end of a 9 p.m. national news broadcast, it said that the National Antiterrorist Committee was checking information about a possible attack on public ground transportation or subway systems, but it did not specify in what city an attack was feared, or when. </p> <p> Last January, a Russian man with sunken cheeks and a wispy mustache crossed into Georgia and traveled to Tbilisi by car along a high mountain road. In two plastic bags in his leather jacket, Georgian authorities say, he carried 100 grams of uranium so refined that it could help fuel an atom bomb. </p> <p> The Russian, Oleg Khinsagov, had come to meet a buyer who he believed would pay him $1 million and deliver the material to a Muslim man from ''a serious organization,'' the authorities say. </p> <p> Seeking to revive stalled negotiations to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program, the United States held ''substantive'' talks with North Korean diplomats here on Tuesday and Wednesday, said the chief American envoy, Christopher R. Hill. </p> <p> The unusual one-on-one sessions, the first to be held outside Beijing during the Bush administration, were signs of progress since negotiations broke off in December after North Korea demanded that Washington lift financial sanctions against it. </p> <p> The United States and four other nations reached a tentative agreement to provide North Korea with roughly $400 million in fuel oil and aid, in return for the North's starting to disable its nuclear facilities and allowing nuclear inspectors back into the country, according to American officials who have reviewed the proposed text. </p> <p> While the accord sets a 60-day deadline for North Korea to accomplish those first steps toward disarmament, it leaves until an undefined moment in the future -- and to another negotiation -- the actual removal of North Korea's nuclear weapons and the fuel that it has manufactured to produce them. </p> <p> Officials in the Czech Republic and Poland vowed Tuesday that they would not be intimidated by Russia, a day after a general in Moscow declared that nuclear weapons could be aimed at their countries if they allowed the Bush administration to build ballistic missile defenses within their borders. </p> <p> Russia has reacted with open hostility to the plan, which comes on the heels of further NATO expansion onto the territory of the former Soviet Union. </p> <p> On a Friday night in late December, the tortuous three-year diplomatic effort to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program finally seemed dead. Two months earlier, North Korea had conducted its first nuclear weapons test, and five days of talks in Beijing had just ended in failure and acrimony. </p> <p> But that evening, the American team sent a messenger to the gated North Korean Embassy. Would the North be interested in a private, bilateral meeting outside Beijing? A few days later, the North agreed and chose a location -- Berlin. </p> <p> It is hard to imagine that either George W. Bush or Kim Jong-il would have agreed even a year ago to the kind of deal they have now approved. The pact, announced Tuesday, would stop, seal and ultimately disable North Korea's nuclear facilities, as part of a grand bargain that the administration has previously shunned as overly generous to a repressive country -- especially one that has not yet said when or if it will give up its nuclear arsenal. </p> <p> But in the past few months, the world has changed for both Mr. Bush and Mr. Kim, two men who have made clear how deeply they detest each other. Both are beset by huge problems, and both needed some kind of breakthrough. </p> <p> The deal that could lead North Korea to shut its main nuclear reactor came under criticism from both ends of the political spectrum immediately after it was announced on Tuesday. </p> <p> From the right, hardliners argued that the United States should have held out until North Korea agreed to fully declare and dismantle its entire nuclear program. </p> <p> Russia's defense minister chose a NATO session here on Friday for a pre-emptive verbal assault on American plans to base elements of a missile defense system in Eastern Europe. </p> <p> The Russian, Sergei B. Ivanov, argued that there was no rationale for basing American antimissile radars and interceptors in former Soviet satellite states that have now joined the NATO alliance. Washington has entered talks with Poland and the Czech Republic to do just that. </p> <p> American officials said Tuesday that they had agreed to hold the highest-level contact with the Iranian authorities in more than two years as part of an international meeting on Iraq. </p> <p> The discussions, scheduled for the next two months, are expected to include Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and her Iranian and Syrian counterparts. </p> <p> Bush administration officials tried Wednesday to tamp down Russian concerns, voiced in strikingly harsh terms, over American plans to base missile defenses in Eastern Europe. </p> <p> Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the missile defense proposal, which calls for deploying 10 interceptors in Poland and radar in the Czech Republic, was solely intended to counter the possible development of long-range Iranian missiles. </p> <p> By now we can too readily imagine the horror of terrorists exploding a nuclear weapon in a major American city: the gutted skyscrapers, the melted cars, the charred bodies. For Sam Nunn, however, a new terror begins the day after. That's when the world asks whether another bomb is out there. ''If a nuclear bomb went off in Moscow or New York City or Jerusalem, any number of groups would claim they have another,'' Nunn told me recently. These groups would make steep demands as intelligence officials scrambled to determine which claims were real. Panic would prevail. Even after the detonation of a small, crude weapon that inflicted less damage than the bomb at Hiroshima, Nunn suggested, ''the psychological damage would be incalculable. It would be a slow, step-by-step process to regain confidence. And the question will be, Why didn't we take steps to prevent this? We will have a whole list of things we wish we'd done.'' </p> <p> Russia said Monday that it would slow work on Iran's nearly completed Bushehr nuclear power plant. </p> <p> Russia contended that Iran had not made the last two $25 million monthly payments, in a dispute about whether it could pay in euros instead of dollars. </p> <p> Britain and the United States said Friday that they were discussing the stationing of an American antiballistic missile defense system on British soil. </p> <p> The United States previously offered to locate the missile system in the Czech Republic and Poland, drawing furious objections from Russia, though Washington argues that the system is not built to defend against Russia but against Iran, principally, and other potential threats. </p> <p> Negotiators on Thursday will resume the long-stalled talks aimed at North Korean nuclear disarmament amid tentative signs of a possible breakthrough in a diplomatic process that seemed shattered four months ago when North Korea tested a nuclear device. </p> <p> Christopher R. Hill, the chief American envoy, arrived in Beijing on Wednesday and held separate meetings with Chinese and Russian diplomats. Mr. Hill has been shuttling around the world, meeting with envoys from North Korea and other countries, in an effort to restart and advance the talks that North Korea abandoned more than a year ago. </p> <p> Negotiations over North Korea's nuclear weapons program stalled on Saturday as disagreements arose about the size and timing of the aid package that would be provided to North Korea in exchange for shutting down the country's nuclear weapons facilities. </p> <p> ''The differences on the issue still remain large,'' said Qin Gang, spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry. </p> <p> IRAN has once again defied the United Nations by proceeding with enrichment activities, the International Atomic Energy Agency reported yesterday. And yet, simultaneously, Iranian officials have been sending a very different message -- one that has gone largely unremarked but merits close attention. </p> <p> After a meeting with the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the leader's chief foreign policy adviser, Ali Akbar Velayati, declared last week that suspending uranium enrichment is not a red line for the regime -- in other words, the mullahs might be ready to agree to some kind of a suspension. Another powerful insider, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, said much the same thing in a different setting, while a third high-ranking official acknowledged that the Islamic Republic is seriously considering a proposal by President Vladimir Putin of Russia to suspend enrichment at least long enough to start serious negotiations with the United Nations. </p> <p> THE six-party agreement signed with North Korea last month should certainly be applauded as a necessary first step in improving relations with the United States. While a good deal of the North Korean program is shrouded in mystery -- just this week the United States again urged the North Koreans to disclose any uranium-enrichment activities -- there are some things we do know, including the nature and status of the country's reactors. </p> <p> North Korea's one functioning reactor, at Yongbyon, uses natural uranium for fuel and graphite as its moderator (the substance that slows the neutrons and enhances the fission reaction). These are the same ingredients used in the first reactor ever designed, which was tested by Enrico Fermi at the University of Chicago in 1942. The best estimate is that Yongbyon has produced about 100 pounds of plutonium since it went into full operation in 1990. This is enough for six to eight nuclear bombs, depending on their design. (The North Koreans might have used about six kilograms in their Oct. 9 test.) The construction of the larger reactors North Korea was building was apparently already suspended, for various technical reasons, before the agreement. </p> <p> The Bush administration announced yesterday the winner of a competition to design the nation's first new nuclear weapon in nearly two decades and immediately set out to reassure Russia and China that the weapon, if built, would pose no new threat to either nation. </p> <p> If President Bush decides to authorize production and Congress agrees, the research could lead to a long, expensive process to replace all American nuclear warheads in the next few decades with new designs. </p> <p> To hear the Democrats vying for the 2008 presidential nomination tell it, their foreign-policy views represent a sharp, even radical break with the course the Bush administration has pursued since 9/11. Senator Hillary Clinton has contrasted President Bush's unilateralism with what she has called her own internationalism. Senator Barack Obama vowed to provide ''the kind of leadership we need to re-establish our standing in the world and renew our allies' respect.'' Former Senator John Edwards has emphasized his differences with the administration's domestic policy, but he has also promised to abandon a foreign policy ''based on ideology'' and to ''return America to its place of moral leadership.'' </p> <p> President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran wants to take part in a meeting of the United Nations Security Council to brief member states about Iran's nuclear program, a government spokesman said Sunday on state-run television. </p> <p> ''The president of Iran plans to speak in a possible meeting of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear program to defend the right of the Iranian nation to use peaceful nuclear technology,'' said the government spokesman, Gholamhossein Elham. </p> <p> When the United States first asked Poland and the Czech Republic to base missile defenses on their soil, the proposed interceptors and radar were cast as a prudent hedge against Iran and a guarantee that Europe's security was indivisible from that of America, which was moving ahead with defenses for its own territory. </p> <p> But with Russia's rejection of a new American invitation to cooperate on missile defense -- a rebuff delivered with an exclamation point when the Kremlin threatened Thursday to pull out of a treaty on conventional weapons in Europe -- the initiative risked driving Moscow further from Europe and dividing Europe's public over the future of its shared security. </p> <p> The Bush administration is offering Russia a new package of incentives to drop its strong opposition to American missile defense sites in Poland and the Czech Republic, including an invitation to begin linking some American and Russian antimissile systems, according to senior administration and military officials. </p> <p> The package includes American offers to cooperate on developing defense technology and to share intelligence about common threats, as well as to permit Russian officials to inspect the future missile bases. </p> <p> Much of Europe is arguing over a Washington proposal to plant in Poland fewer than a dozen antimissile missiles that might not work, to guard against an Iranian threat that may not exist. </p> <p> The main party in Poland's governing coalition is inclined to accept the deal, and the country's president, Lech Kaczynski, known in Europe for his fierce conservatism and nationalist talk, has been invited to the White House in July to talk things over with President Bush. </p> <p> On Thursday there will be a regional conference in Egypt to discuss stabilizing Iraq, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will represent the U.S. President Bush should go instead and give this speech: </p> <p> I want to take this opportunity to speak to the Arab and Muslim nations gathered here today and to the world at large. I begin with a simple message: I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I rushed into the invasion of Iraq. I honestly believed that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. I was wrong, and I now realize that in unilaterally launching the war the way I did, you all feel that I breached a bond of trust between America and the world. Not only did that alienate you from us, it made us less effective in Iraq. We had too few allies and too little legitimacy. I apologize -- sincerely. </p> <p> ALMOST a year has passed since Israel's bombardment of Lebanon, time enough to draw lessons from the conflict and reflect on its consequences. </p> <p> Last week, Israel's Winograd Commission published an interim report scrutinizing Israel's conduct during what it called the country's most recent military ''campaign.'' But the report failed to draw the most essential lesson from the July war and the wars that preceded it: military action does not give the people of Israel security. On the contrary, it compromises it. The only way for the people of Israel and the Arab world to achieve stability and security is through a comprehensive peace settlement to the overarching Arab-Israeli conflict. </p> <p> Russia and the United States on Wednesday appeared to step back from their confrontation over American plans for installations in Europe relating to a missile shield, as President Bush said Russia was not a threat to Europe and the Russian foreign minister withdrew a threat to pull out of a conventional arms treaty. </p> <p> The conciliatory remarks came as leaders of the Group of 8 industrialized nations gathered for a meeting that was at risk of being overshadowed by the threat by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to aim Russian missiles at nuclear sites in Europe if the United States places the installations in Poland and the Czech Republic. </p> <p> The United States appears to be close to reaching a deal to transfer $25 million in frozen funds to North Korea, with Russia and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York acting as intermediaries, in hopes of getting North Korea to begin to dismantle its nuclear arms program, American officials said Monday. </p> <p> The funds have been frozen for nearly two years at a bank that the Bush administration has labeled a violator of American money laundering laws. Because of that label, the bank is barred from doing business with any bank in the United States. </p> <p> The United States and Russia have agreed to accelerate a program that detects radioactive materials along Russia's borders and plan to have automated detection systems installed at all Russian border crossing points by 2011, American energy officials said Thursday. </p> <p> As part of the agreement, the program, administered jointly by Russia's federal custom service and the National Nuclear Security Administration in the United States, will be completed six years ahead of schedule. </p> <p> Russia's intelligence service said Friday that it had opened a criminal investigation into British espionage here in Russia, based on statements and undisclosed evidence provided by a businessman who is accused of poisoning Alexander V. Litvinenko, a former K.G.B. officer and a Kremlin critic. </p> <p> The announcement by the Federal Security Service, the domestic successor of the Soviet K.G.B., further confused a murder investigation that has soured relations between Russia and Britain. The countries have staked out starkly different positions regarding the killing of Mr. Litvinenko and the motives behind it. </p> <p> A year after President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice announced a new strategy toward Iran, a behind-the-scenes debate has broken out within the administration over whether the approach has any hope of reining in Iran's nuclear program, according to senior administration officials. </p> <p> The debate has pitted Ms. Rice and her deputies, who appear to be winning so far, against the few remaining hawks inside the administration, especially those in Vice President Dick Cheney's office who, according to some people familiar with the discussions, are pressing for greater consideration of military strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities. </p> <p> As historical discoveries go, the Rasputin diary that surfaced here this year is hardly a bombshell. Written in an ordinary notebook in a crude, barely legible scrawl and a style described as half-literate, the musings of the Siberian monk who wielded such a sinister influence over the court of the last Czar of Russia are disappointingly dull. </p> <p> "As in old times, our mother the Czarina is busy only with her daughters and the education of her son, the great heir Aleksei Nikolayevich," reads one of the passages from the 12-page text, written sometime from 1911 to 1913. "Here is the proof of this education. He is like a sun shining with love for his people, and he is loved reciprocally." </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin ordered an inquiry today into spectacular charges leveled earlier this week -- so far without evidence -- that Russia's equivalent of the F.B.I. plotted to kill one of the country's most influential tycoons. </p> <p> The tycoon is Boris A. Berezovsky, an oil magnate and director of Russia's biggest television network, who was a leading supporter of Mr. Yeltsin during the last presidential campaign in 1996. </p> <p> If in watching President Boris N. Yeltsin's latest game of political shuffleboard, you feel you have seen this movie  before, you are almost right. It's ''Groundhog Day,'' the 1993 film in which Bill Murray plays a man who is condemned to reliving the same events over and over again. </p> <p> So it is here in Moscow, where ordinary citizens and political commentators are wearily picking their way through the debris of what some were still calling a Government crisis, despite the fact that Mr. Yeltsin has changed his Government so many times in the last 17 months -- four to be exact -- that the word ''crisis'' has lost all meaning. </p> <p> As fighting continued in southern Russia, the new Prime Minister today threatened to launch air strikes against Islamic militants in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, risking a widening of the seven-day-old conflict in a neighboring region, Dagestan. </p> <p> Soon after Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin made his threat, a spokesman for the Chechen government in Moscow was quoted on radio as saying that if Russia attacks Chechnya, Chechen forces are ready to make ''Russian helicopters drop from the sky like rain.'' </p> <p> As the race to succeed him next year threatens to slip out of his control, President Boris N. Yeltsin tipped his hand, and Russia's political apple cart, by firing his Prime Minister today and replacing him with a former K.G.B.  officer and loyal aide who he said was his favorite to become the next president. </p> <p> From a politician who regularly uses surprise as a weapon, Mr. Yeltsin's latest move, nominating Vladimir V. Putin (pronounced POO-teen) to replace Sergei V. Stepashin -- in his fourth Government shake-up in 17 months -- was met with more dismay than shock. Even former allies accused him of playing politics at the expense of the increasingly fragile authority of Russia's central Government. </p> <p> Vladimir V. Putin is not a household name. </p> <p> This much the Kremlin was ready to acknowledge today after the 46-year-old chief of Russia's domestic intelligence service and newly nominated Prime Minister was introduced to a stunned Russian public as the man President Boris N. Yeltsin wants as his successor in a year. </p> <p> There was little debate and no drama in Parliament today as a majority of deputies voted swiftly, if grudgingly, to approve President Boris N. Yeltsin's latest nominee for Prime Minister, by a margin of 233 to 84. </p> <p> With their attention fixed on their own coming re-election campaigns, parliamentary leaders openly treated the confirmation of Vladimir V. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer selected by Mr. Yeltsin last week as his heir apparent, as a perfunctory duty that had to be performed before getting down to the real business of arranging campaign strategies. </p> <p> As Russian forces continued to battle Islamic militants in the mountains of the North Caucasus, Vladimir V. Putin, the newly designated Prime Minister, said today that he had proposed  a ''package of measures'' to bring the volatile situation under control. </p> <p> Emerging from a meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin, who yesterday anointed him as the Kremlin candidate in presidential elections next year, Mr. Putin, the former head of Russia's domestic intelligence service, said he hoped that the measures would quell the Islamic fundamentalist insurrection within weeks. He did not say what the measures were. </p> <p> As Russian and international agencies struggled to keep up with the tide of Chechen refugees fleeing air strikes by Russian warplanes, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin refused today to rule out a possible ground war against the rebellious southern province. </p> <p> Mr. Putin also said that talks with the Chechen President, Aslan Maskhadov, were still possible but only if  Chechnya's elected leaders take a stand against the Islamic militants who have used Chechnya as a base for attacks against neighboring provinces, and are suspected of waging a terrorist campaign in Russia. </p> <p> Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said tonight that Russian law enforcement authorities are cooperating in an investigation into a suspected money laundering scheme involving Russian money at the Bank of New York, and asserted that the sums involved were far less than the billions of dollars reported. </p> <p> ''The scope described in the press -- huge billions -- obviously doesn't correspond to reality but I repeat, the problem exists and we will work on it, without dramatizing it but without ignoring it,'' he said in a television interview. </p> <p> In a heavy setback for the Russian military, Islamic militants have mounted a ferocious assault in Dagestan, and a powerful bomb demolished an apartment building housing Russian officers and their families in that Russian republic. </p> <p> Russian officials, who had all but declared victory against the rebels nearly two weeks ago, said at least 30 people had been killed and about 110 wounded in the blast, which occurred late Saturday night when a car bomb exploded in Buinaksk, Dagestan's second-largest city. They said women and children were among the casualties. </p> <p> Russia has no plans to wage another war in its secession-minded Chechnya region to suppress Islamic militants who are mounting attacks from bases there, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said tonight. </p> <p> But at the same time, Mr. Putin said the Government has no intention of ceding anything to the Chechen militants, who have twice invaded the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan and are widely blamed for terrorist bombings that have killed hundreds in Moscow and the southern region of Rostov. </p> <p> With his popularity ratings soaring, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin today hopped a 10-minute ride aboard a Sukhoi-25 fighter plane on a one-day tour of the war zone along the border of rebellious Chechnya. </p> <p> Two months after having been picked to head President Boris N. Yeltsin's latest Government, Mr. Putin has shot up in the rankings of potential presidential contenders, buoyed by broad public support for a military campaign aimed at crushing Islamic guerrillas who have made Chechnya their base. </p> <p> Russia said today that its troops had seized the northern third of Chechnya in a bold attempt to hem in Islamic militants who have taken refuge there. </p> <p> Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin said Russian troops had already reached the Terek River, which divides the secessionist republic. ''The final goal is the full destruction of the terrorists,'' he said. </p> <p> In the dead of night, without lights, cars drove along a narrow track, over the Terek River and into a small village. Voices called a low greeting from the roadside. ''Allah-u-Akbar,'' the rallying cry of the Chechen forces. The men, quiet and serious, returned the greeting. </p> <p> Reinforcements of Chechen fighters were heading in Saturday night to strengthen the resistance to the Russian advance in northern Chechnya. After indicating last week that they were ceding the northern bank of the Terek River to the superior might of the Russians, the Chechens say they have retaken a number of villages like this one north of the river. </p> <p> In a move that could intensify the conflict in the northern Caucasus, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin today cut Moscow's last links with the elected government of the breakaway republic of Chechnya. </p> <p> For eight days, Russian planes have been bombing what it says are strongholds held by Islamic militants in Chechnya who have launched armed attacks against Russian territory. Moscow also says the militants have set off bombs that have killed almost 300 people in Moscow and other Russian cities. </p> <p> As Russia continued its heavy bombing of the Chechen capital, Grozny, today, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin told top security officials that the war in the secessionist region had reached a turning point. </p> <p> Russia's security council, meeting in the Kremlin this evening, was set to produce a plan on the next phase of Russia's war in Chechnya, in time for next week's international summit meeting in Istanbul, where Western leaders are expected again to urge Moscow to curb its campaign. </p> <p> When President Clinton and I met in Oslo earlier this month, we discussed the situation in Chechnya. Accounts of that conversation in the American media, understandably, emphasized the president's warnings about the impact of Russia's military operations. Because we value our relations with the United States and care about Americans' perception of us, I want to explain our actions in clear terms. </p> <p> To do so, I ask you to put aside for a moment the dramatic news reports from the Caucasus and imagine something more placid: ordinary New Yorkers or Washingtonians, asleep in their homes. Then, in a flash, hundreds perish in explosions at the Watergate, or at an apartment complex on Manhattan's West Side. Thousands are injured, some horribly disfigured. Panic engulfs a neighborhood, then a nation. </p> <p> Russia sought today to cut off Chechnya from the outside world by banning foreign trade with the breakaway republic and suspending international flights to the region. </p> <p> Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin said the measures are needed to stop arms smuggling and to prevent Islamic terrorists from flocking to the northern Caucasus region. </p> <p> At a meeting here today with Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, President Clinton expressed strong concern over the Russian air and artillery bombing of Chechnya and the suffering of civilians in the breakaway region, a senior administration official said. </p> <p> Mr. Clinton urged the Russian to move toward a ''political dialogue'' or risk serious damage to his country's international reputation, the official said. Mr. Putin was in Oslo, along with Mr. Clinton, to attend ceremonies for the fourth anniversary of the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel. </p> <p> Boris N. Yeltsin returned today from an official visit to Beijing sounding more like a recidivist Soviet premier than a president, having rattled Russia's nuclear saber at President Clinton on Wednesday and having denounced American culture, values and military dominance before leaving Beijing this afternoon. </p> <p> But more intriguing, perhaps, is what Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin was doing in Moscow while he was gone. </p> <p> After enduring two months of thunderous bombardments, a trickle of dispirited refugees straggled out of the besieged Chechen capital today and made their way to the Russian military checkpoint in the Tersky hills three miles away. </p> <p> The checkpoint marks the end of an escape corridor that the Russians hope will lead to the evacuation of the thousands of civilians trapped in Grozny. Russia says it has stopped bombing the city, and has pledged not to attack the escape route. </p> <p> An unexpectedly strong showing by pro-government parties in Russian parliamentary elections on Sunday appeared likely to give President Boris N. Yeltsin a more compliant legislature as he heads into his last six months in office. It also gives his designated heir, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, a firm launching pad for the presidency. </p> <p> Surveys of voters leaving the polls indicated that the Communist Party, the bulwark of the anti-Yeltsin opposition, could still emerge as Russia's largest single party, with about 25 percent of the vote, cast on the basis of party lists that will fill half of the 450 seats in the Duma, the lower house of Parliament. The Communists are expected to pick up more seats in the 225 single districts, where final results will be known only later this week. </p> <p> His domestic base cemented by Sunday's parliamentary elections, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin signaled today that he wants to mend relations with the West by calling for ratification of the six-year-old Start II nuclear arms treaty. </p> <p> Mr. Putin pressed for approval of the accord in a meeting with leaders of the newly elected Parliament, as  Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott arrived here for talks on arms control and other issues. </p> <p> Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, standing in for President Boris N. Yeltsin at a Kremlin ceremony, said tonight that Russia's ''national pride'' was at stake in the war to retake rebellious Chechnya. </p> <p> Mr. Putin, the Kremlin's favored candidate in the presidential race next summer, said Russia was duty bound to crush the rebels after their ''brazen and impudent'' invasion of a neighboring region in August. </p> <p> Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, newly confirmed in the parliamentary elections as Russia's current political hero for his tough conduct of the war in Chechnya, signaled today that he was now prepared to put his stamp on domestic issues -- to meet voters' demands, as he said, for ''new results, new ideas and new solutions.'' </p> <p> In effect, Mr. Putin, 47, opened up the second stage of a Kremlin campaign that has already made him a clear favorite -- at least for now -- to succeed President Boris N. Yeltsin in elections set for June. </p> <p> If the West believes that Russia's parliamentary elections were a strong vote for democracy and market reform, it is deluding itself. </p> <p> The elections on Sunday were indeed a remarkable victory for Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who revealed he has long political coattails. His endorsement late last month of the Unity bloc, a diverse coalition concocted by the Kremlin in the last three months of the campaign, propelled it from single-digit poll ratings to a second-place finish, behind the Communists, with nearly a quarter of the vote. </p> <p> The West has long seen the development of democracy in Russia as a check against the Kremlin's military ambitions and a way to bridge the political divide between East and West. </p> <p> But consider the results of Russia's parliamentary elections: millions went to the polls and demonstrated their support for the war in Chechnya, despite its apparent brutality, by voting for candidates backed by Vladimir V. Putin, the hawkish prime minister closely associated with the war. </p> <p> The race for Russia's third Parliament since the end of the Soviet Union, to be chosen Sunday in a marathon 23 hours of voting, was less a campaign than a barroom brawl, a chairs-over-the-head affair suffused with slander, manipulation and unvarnished peculiarity on all sides. </p> <p> Yet it was also a race that the public took seriously, despite its disgust at the tactics. Between the opening of the first polling booths at 8 a.m. local time Sunday in Russia's Far East and the closing of the last, 11 time zones to the west, in Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea, as many as 80 percent of the 107 million eligible voters are expected to cast ballots for the Duma, as the lower house of Parliament is called. </p> <p> The refugees were nowhere to be found. But that did not fluster Sergei Shoigu, Russia's minister for emergency situations and the leader of a Kremlin-backed party in parliamentary elections next weekend. </p> <p> Zipped up in a natty red jacket, Mr. Shoigu led a caravan of journalists from this checkpoint on the Chechnya-Ingushetia border to a small town near the outskirts of Grozny, the Chechen capital. </p> <p> The political party most closely associated with Acting President Vladimir V. Putin unexpectedly joined forces with the Communists today to re-elect the Communist speaker of the Russian Parliament's lower house. </p> <p> The unexpected maneuver blocked two former prime ministers, Yevgeny M. Primakov and Sergei V. Stepashin, from a chance to lead the Duma, the lower house of Parliament, and prompted a furious walkout by more than 100 deputies in protest against what one described as a ''a cynical backroom deal,'' and another as a ''political farce.'' </p> <p> Acting President Vladimir Putin's campaign to wipe out all Chechen resistance to Moscow's authority is no longer a triumphal parade. Russian casualties have begun to mount. </p> <p> This is not good for a political campaign whose candidate's sudden popularity depends solely on a cost-free victory over the despised Chechens. The election was moved closer in a Yeltsin-Putin deal so it could be conducted during the war fever, but body bags dampen jingoistic spirits. </p> <p> In contrast to his predecessors as leader of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin appears to be a modern decision maker who knows how to make things happen, Clinton Administration officials say. What remains unclear is whether his political instincts match that style of action. </p> <p> ''He can get the trains running on time, but the question is where the trains are going,'' said one senior policy maker. ''We may be looking at a modern decision maker but the question is whether he has progressive values.'' </p> <p> Leaders of three Russian political parties agreed today to end their boycott of the Russian Parliament on Feb. 9, thereby avoiding an open-ended confrontation with the acting president, Vladimir V. Putin, and his parliamentary allies. </p> <p> Mr. Putin had interceded in the parliamentary dispute earlier this week by meeting separately with two former prime ministers, Yevgeny M. Primakov and Sergei V. Kiriyenko. The men, together with Grigory A. Yavlinksy, leader of the liberal Yabloko party, led a parliamentary walkout last week to protest what they called strong-arm tactics by the Kremlin. </p> <p> The suspension of Russia's barrage of Grozny was not, in a sense, much of a surprise, since it made a virtue out of a military necessity. </p> <p> Acting President Vladimir V. Putin, attending a Christmas service  for the Orthodox in Moscow late Friday, said that the decision to suspend the bombardment of Grozny, the Chechen capital, was taken to spare civilians and to honor both the Orthodox feast and a Muslim holiday this weekend. </p> <p> A Russian doctor told the ambulance driver to take his patient directly to the morgue. ''Why?'' cried the patient. ''I'm not dead yet.'' ''Shut up,'' said the doctor. ''We're not there yet.'' </p> <p> That lugubrious joke is being told about Vladimir Putin, chosen by the Kremlin clique to succeed Boris Yeltsin. In eight weeks, riding a wave of war hysteria, this K.G.B. apparatchik is likely to be elected president -- to take his patient, Russia, to the cooler of repression and autocratic rule. </p> <p> Boris N. Yeltsin shocked his nation and the world today, announcing his resignation as president six months before the end of his term and handing over power to his favored successor, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin. </p> <p> Mr. Yeltsin, 68, concluded his political career on the same note of surprise and high drama that accompanied his entire path from early convert to perestroika to erratic master of a free but floundering Russia. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin's resignation today drove Russian stocks to their highest levels since the 1998 economic collapse, reflecting hope among investors that the acting president, Vladimir V. Putin, would revive stalled economic reforms. </p> <p> The Russian Trading System stock index, the main stock market barometer in the country, rose 18 percent to 177.71. The increase was the greatest one-day jump since July 14, 1998, when the International Monetary Fund agreed to lend Russia $22.8 billion. </p> <p> If Boris N. Yeltsin really meant it about being forgiven for his mistakes when he made the stunning announcement of his resignation today, as far as many people on the streets of Moscow were concerned, he needn't have bothered. </p> <p> After decades of secretive and brutal Communist rule, eight years of topsy-turvy economics under Mr. Yeltsin and countless maneuvers that made little difference to their daily grind, many Muscovites seemed simply glad to see an aging, obviously unwell leader leave the scene -- or just did not care. </p> <p> After the Kremlin's newborn political party registered a thumping victory in parliamentary elections last week, reporters asked Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin whether his strengthened hand might lead to changes in the government. Mr. Putin was characteristically forthcoming. ''We'll see,'' he said. </p> <p> That much Russia now sees, in spades. But in its new president's fashion, much about the man who now runs Russia, and who seems likely to win the suddenly scheduled election for the presidency in March, remains behind a veil. </p> <p> By demonstrating a readiness to cut a deal with the Communists in the legislature, Vladimir V. Putin, Russia's current and perhaps future president, is evidently willing to forsake ideological allies and embrace ideological enemies to achieve his ends. The question remains: what ends? </p> <p> Mr. Putin, who has clogged newspapers, airwaves and even the Internet with paeans to democratic ideals since taking power from Boris N. Yeltsin last month, stunned outsiders on Tuesday by making a power-sharing arrangement in the newly elected lower house of Parliament with the Communist Party, which would seem, ideologically, to be his sworn enemy. The Communists got a sheaf of committees and the all-powerful speaker's chair. In return, direct supporters of Mr. Putin, the acting president, got a lock on key legislative committees. </p> <p> Underscoring its darkening view of the West, the Kremlin issued a national security strategy today that inveighs against an expansionist Europe and United States and contemplates the use of nuclear weapons in war ''if all other means of resolving the crisis have been exhausted.'' </p> <p> The revised language governing nuclear weapons is a subtle but unmistakable stiffening of the previous strategy, issued in 1997, which allowed the use of nuclear arms only ''in case of a threat to the existence of the Russian Federation.'' </p> <p> Only Vladimir V. Putin knows for certain where he wants to take Russia as the nation's acting president. But if his visit last week to the federal Railways Ministry is any indication, Russia may be in for an interesting trip indeed. </p> <p> As the Moscow daily Kommersant reported, Mr. Putin performed the rote ceremonial duties at a packed meeting of ministry employees eight days ago, doling out awards and praising the railroads' contribution to the economy. </p> <p> On his first full day as Russia's acting president, Vladimir V. Putin left before dawn today to visit with Russian troops fighting in Chechnya. </p> <p> While his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin, spent his first day of retirement at a government country house outside Moscow, Mr. Putin and his wife, Lyudmila -- he in a turtleneck sweater, she in pants and a sheepskin coat -- spent what was left of the momentous New Year's holiday greeting Russian soldiers and handing out hunting knives as presidential souvenirs. </p> <p> When he is asked about the fighting in Grozny, Konstantin Kukhlovets shows the red splotch on his index finger. The 24-year-old lieutenant said he was firing his machine gun so furiously that he was scalded by the heat of the gun barrel. </p> <p> Three of his men were wounded in a 10-minute firefight, and Lieutenant Kukhlovets says his entire unit might have been annihilated if they had tried to fight their way into the center of the city against entrenched Chechen rebels. </p> <p> As always, Boris N. Yeltsin picked his moment. </p> <p> By choosing to resign on the last day of the old year, Mr. Yeltsin guaranteed that almost all Russians would be deeply engaged in celebrating the arrival of the new one, traditionally the day of the biggest family feast here. Better than that, he acted at a time of enormous political flux: the start of a protracted break in the political year, and just 12 days after the election of a new Parliament, where rival blocs have yet to solidify. </p> <p> Boris Yeltsin's unexpected resignation was a brilliant political ploy, and one with worrisome implications for the West. </p> <p> The move was clever because it enhanced the presidential prospects of Mr. Yeltsin's chosen successor, Vladimir Putin; it will improve the chances of Mr. Yeltsin's being remembered as a patriot rather than a leader who put ambition ahead of the nation's interests; and it allowed Mr. Putin to give Mr. Yeltsin immunity against corruption charges. </p> <p> Russia's Acting President, Vladimir V. Putin, today selected an experienced debt negotiator as his top deputy prime minister and shunted aside two high- ranking government officials closely linked with former President Boris N. Yeltsin, further putting his own stamp on the Kremlin. </p> <p> By choosing Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, 42, for the Russian government's No. 2 position, Mr. Putin also signaled the importance of Russia's relations with its Western creditors -- and dropped a hint about a possible successor as prime minister, if he wins the March 26 presidential elections. Until the elections, Mr. Putin will stay on as Russia's prime minister. </p> <p> After I expressed my intent to explore an area that strikes terror of embarrassment into so many hearts, a colleague warned, ''I wouldn't go there if I were you.'' </p> <p> Linguistic exploration rejects such faintheartedness. We will now deal forthrightly with the cliche that has been embraced by the squirming squeamish: Don't go there. </p> <p> The Clinton administration's top policy maker on Russia, in his annual assessment of where that country is headed, has presented a more wary review this time, even hinting at the possible return of some Soviet habits. </p> <p> The policy official, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, said in a speech at Oxford University in England on Friday that the war in Chechnya and the transfer of power to Acting President Vladimir V. Putin raised the question of how the resurgence of Russian nationalism would assert itself. </p> <p> In the nearly two months since Vladimir V. Putin became acting president of Russia, the world has barely begun getting to know him. But already, he is building a clear record in one area of policy: little noticed by the West, Mr. Putin, a former lieutenant colonel in the K.G.B., is rapidly remilitarizing Russian society. </p> <p> Visitors to the old Soviet Union used to be surprised at the sheer number of people in uniform in the streets. At 18, men were conscripted for two years of mandatory military service. Virtually everyone who had graduated from a technical, medical or foreign-languages college was considered an officer of the reserves and required to report for regular training exercises. </p> <p> In a surprise appearance at a Middle East conference here, the acting president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin, sat down two chairs away from the secretary of state, Madeleine K. Albright, and delivered his first foreign policy statement, which within 15 minutes delineated the differences between the two countries. </p> <p> Yet in his brisk, businesslike summary of fairly standard points, Mr. Putin did not mention the war in Chechnya. Russia considers the war an internal affair, but Washington continues to press Moscow to negotiate a settlement to end it. </p> <p> Former Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov today took himself out of the running in the March 26 presidential election, deserting a field that is already dominated by Acting President Vladimir V. Putin. </p> <p> Mr. Primakov, 70, leader of the  foundering centrist opposition, said  today that his decision was based on his conclusion that Russia still had a long way to go before becoming a civil society and a true democracy. </p> <p> Boris A. Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich, financiers with close ties to the Kremlin, have acquired three important Russian aluminum smelters in eastern Siberia in deals that would give them nearly full control over the country's enormous aluminum industry. </p> <p> Mr. Abramovich is already the principal owner of Sibneft, a leading Russian oil conglomerate. Mr. Berezovsky is widely believed to have a stake in the company as well, though Sibneft has never confirmed it. </p> <p> Russian soldiers did not capture Grozny. They obliterated it. </p> <p> Apartment houses along Lenin Prospekt have been pulverized. Minutka Square, once a bustling plaza, has been blasted beyond recognition. </p> <p> Nine years ago a sea of Russians celebrating the collapse of a Communist-backed coup jammed the traffic circle outside K.G.B. headquarters in Moscow and stripped away icons of dictatorship, including a bust and plaque honoring the late spymaster and Soviet ruler, Yuri V. Andropov. </p> <p> On Dec. 20, in a little-noticed ceremony at entrance 1A of the old headquarters, workers put them back -- on the personal order of Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin. </p> <p> Soon after he became prime minister, Vladimir V. Putin summoned his predecessors to a September meeting to discuss Chechnya. </p> <p> A limited operation to seal the borders of the breakaway republic and to occupy the pro-Russian parts had been planned for months. But Russian generals, humiliated by the 1994-96 war in Chechnya, were pushing for a decisive fight. </p> <p> In a sign of his desire to cultivate closer ties with the West, Acting President Vladimir V. Putin agreed today to end an 11-month estrangement between Russia and NATO and rebuild what the Kremlin called an alliance aimed at ''a stable and indivisible Europe.'' </p> <p> The thaw was announced after a meeting between Mr. Putin and NATO's secretary general, George Robertson. Formally, at least, it closes a cavernous divide that opened last March after NATO started its air war against Yugoslavia. </p> <p> After a month of what she called ''psychobabble'' from people trying to decipher Russia's new leader, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright met Vladimir V. Putin today on his turf and said she was taken with his ''can-do approach'' and his lack of dogma. </p> <p> ''I found him a very well-informed person, a good interlocutor, obviously a Russian patriot who seeks a normal position with the West,'' she said of Mr. Putin, who also caught her attention by abandoning note cards that his aides had prepared for him. </p> <p> Nearly five months after he dispatched Russian forces to Chechnya, Acting President Vladimir V. Putin announced today that the Russian military had captured its capital, Grozny, and that the Russian tricolor was flying over it. </p> <p> ''A short time ago, the last stronghold of the terrorists' resistance was taken: the Zavodsky district of the city,'' Mr. Putin told the ORT television network. ''So we can say that the operation for the freeing of Grozny has ended.'' </p> <p> With the inevitability of a Greek tragedy, Russia's military intervention in Chechnya has followed the script rehearsed in the war in the mid-1990's. </p> <p> As in February 1995, Russian soldiers are picking over the ruins of Grozny, the Chechen capital, after a costly fight and are facing a vicious battle in the mountains of southern Chechnya. Russia must now decide if it wants to repeat the closing act of the previous war, when it rejected negotiations with the Chechens after taking Grozny. It only conceded to a peace agreement in 1997, after two years of guerrilla warfare and terrorist attacks by Chechen rebels. </p> <p> Russia has reached an agreement with foreign commercial creditors to restructure $31.8 billion of its external debt, handing Acting President Vladimir V. Putin an important political victory and helping to clear the way for the country to tap international money markets again. </p> <p> Russia was effectively barred from borrowing overseas after the August 1998 economic crisis, when it defaulted on domestic treasury bills and stopped making payments on its debts to foreign banks and governments. Over the last 18 months, Russia has met with representatives of the London Club of commercial creditors, a loose affiliation of banks and investors, to draw up a repayment schedule to ease Russia's debt burden and to restore its image. </p> <p> They don't make them much tougher than Siberian bulldozer operators, and so it follows that Roman Khasanov, a 30-year-old excavator from the flat, treeless permafrost of Yakutia, has little use for politicians who feel people's pain. By his way of thinking, it was Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his squishy notions of perestroika and glasnost -- restructuring and openness -- that brought Russia to ruination in the first place. </p> <p> ''When he took off the handcuffs, he should have done so slowly,'' Mr. Khasanov said as he sat, nursing a vodka hangover with ulcer medicine, on a train bound to a Mongolia construction job. ''Because now people don't know what to do with their freedom.'' </p> <p> If enough people bother to vote today in Russia, Vladimir Putin is expected to be elected president by a wide margin. What then? Is he the inscrutable ''black box'' some observers have described, or even a Russian Pinochet determined to establish order by whatever means required? Or will he turn out to be a democratic reformer, eager to get on with the changes Russia needs to become a just and prosperous society? </p> <p> Of course, neither Russians nor outsiders can be certain what Mr. Putin will do. But one guide we might consider is Boris Yeltsin's motives in setting him on the succession track. </p> <p> After a series of battlefield reversals, Russia has captured one of Chechnya's most notorious warlords and whisked him to Moscow to stand trial, Acting President Vladimir V. Putin said today. </p> <p> Russian agents seized the warlord, Salman Raduyev, on Sunday, Mr. Putin said. Mr. Raduyev, a Chechen commander best known for a daring 1996 hostage-taking raid in neighboring Dagestan, was brought to Lefortovo prison in Moscow, where he was shown tonight on Russian television. </p> <p> The movie theater was plastered with posters for coming films from Hollywood, but inside there was no attraction for Yuliya Lysova and Dasha Yegorova, both 18. A decade after the Soviet collapse, they were being forced, on a school day, to attend a ''Young People for Zyuganov'' rally featuring the Communist Party's candidate for president, Gennadi A. Zyuganov. </p> <p> ''Our teacher told us to come here instead of classes,'' said Ms. Lysova, glancing at her watch, then at the door of the auditorium, trying to determine whether the coast was clear for a fast exit. ''It was obligatory.'' </p> <p> 'You know,'' says Igor Shadkhan, as we sit in his office and discuss his longtime friend Vladimir Putin, ''Henry Kissinger came here to St. Petersburg when Putin was deputy mayor. Putin spoke to him in German.'' </p> <p> Vladimir Putin, Russia's acting president, has a few unlikely friends, and one of them is Igor Shadkhan -- a Jewish documentary film producer who says he was a quiet anti-Soviet dissident in his day. Any self-respecting K.G.B. officer should have had three different kinds of alarm bells ringing over these attributes, but not, it seems, the future president. Shadkhan made a film about Putin in the early 90's, when the latter was first deputy mayor of Petersburg and became his friend. </p> <p> With Russia's presidential elections just a week away, Acting President Vladimir V. Putin sought to reassure voters today that the war in Chechnya was drawing to a close and that some Russian troops would soon be on their way home. </p> <p> ''There will be no more organized resistance,'' Mr. Putin said. ''Large-scale military operations are coming to an end.'' </p> <p> When Boris N. Yeltsin was re-elected Russia's president in 1996, he owed his victory in large part to the so-called oligarchs, a group of Russian multimillionaires -- bankers, oilmen and media moguls -- who in turn owed their wealth and influence to Mr. Yeltsin. </p> <p> This closed and cozy circle worked very well for a very few in Russia until Dec. 31 when Mr. Yeltsin suddenly resigned, putting the Kremlin in the hands of Vladimir V. Putin, the man poised to win Russia's presidential election on March 26. </p> <p> As Russia's election campaign moved into the home stretch, Acting President Vladimir V. Putin recently hopped a commuter train out of Moscow to meet with factory workers on the city's outskirts. </p> <p> He was not the only politician who made the trip. Yuri M. Luzhkov, the Moscow mayor and formerly one of Mr. Putin's bitterest rivals, also showed up to demonstrate his loyalty. </p> <p> The air is so choked with dust deep in the October Revolution Mine that only the beams from the coal miners' headlamps are visible in the distance. </p> <p> That group of 12 miners is wrestling with a roaring grinding machine that works its way like an iron mole along the seam. It gouges chunks of sparkling coal from the wall and spews the shards onto a conveyor. </p> <p> Russia's state-owned television has broadcast reports that the nation's leading liberal challenger to Vladimir V. Putin is supported by Jews, homosexuals and foreigners. </p> <p> The three prime-time reports by the ORT television network were clearly intended to exploit the anti-Semitism, homophobia and suspicion of foreigners that still pervade Russian society, as well as its enthusiasm for conspiracy theories. </p> <p> The most autocratic governor on Russia's Pacific Rim received a particularly warm birthday greeting last month: heads of the regional press gathered to give him a cake in the shape of his fief and offered up a specially composed ditty. </p> <p> ''Dear Yevgeny, what a friend, your opposition is at the end,'' the editors congratulated the governor, Yevgeny Nazdratenko. </p> <p> On the day after his decisive victory in a field of 11 candidates in the presidential election on Sunday, Vladimir V. Putin told his cabinet today that it was time to put ''all our work'' on a new economic program into one ''weighty document'' by the time he is sworn in and appoints his new government in early May. </p> <p> Mr. Putin's reference to an economic blueprint that he steadfastly refused to discuss during the campaign was a pointed reminder that planning was well under way for his presidency. </p> <p> President Clinton congratulated President-elect Vladimir V. Putin today on his victory in the Russian election, but also reiterated in a brief telephone conversation White House concerns about Russia's continuing conflict in Chechnya. </p> <p> Mr. Clinton placed the call this morning after it became clear that Mr. Putin had received enough votes in the balloting on Sunday to avoid a runoff next month against Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the Communist leader, who finished a distant second. Mr. Clinton's remarks reflected the administration's optimism toward Mr. Putin but also its wait-and-see attitude toward the former intelligence officer who has spoken of being a reformer and of integrating Russia into the world community. </p> <p> After hearing Vladimir V. Putin's pre-election plans to create a sounder economy and friendlier investment climate, foreign investors and local business people say the new Russian president has to take decisive action in the next few months for the country to see marked increases in investment. </p> <p> The tasks Mr. Putin faces are daunting, partly because years of neglect under the government of Boris N. Yeltsin have deepened so many problems. Business people are counting on his carrying out long-delayed initiatives like tax and customs reform. Just as important, Mr. Putin has to nurture an environment where businesses feel they are treated fairly. That means reducing Russia's corruption and the profound influence powerful business people, domestic conglomerates and upstart regions have on the government. </p> <p> As Russia ambles toward a second presidential election almost surreal in its absence of sturm, drang or even garden-variety suspense, perhaps its most amazing aspect is that nobody yet has a clear notion of what the front-runner in the race -- if it can be called a race -- would actually do if elected. </p> <p> That front-runner, of course, is Vladimir V. Putin, Russia's acting president and the anointed successor to President Boris N. Yeltsin. With but five days to the vote, Mr. Putin's name recognition is no problem: his spare visage is plastered on every newspaper and television screen and extolled by local kingpins in regions many time zones away. </p> <p> The last time this city's white-walled fortress fell to Moscow was in 1552, when Ivan the Terrible defeated the powerful Tatar khanate of Kazan. Now Tatarstan -- one of the 89 regions in Russia's awkward and disjointed federation -- is under siege again, this time by Vladimir V. Putin. </p> <p> Mr. Putin, the acting president and the clear favorite in the March 26 presidential election, keeps hammering away at variations of a single theme: the urgent need to restore the authority of a strong central government in Russia and bring its far-flung, free-wheeling regions to heel. </p> <p> At his first meeting with a Western leader since he became the Russian head of state, Acting President Vladimir V. Putin today told Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain that he was willing to give human rights organizations more access to the war zone in Chechnya. </p> <p> But with Russian troops fighting some of the bloodiest battles of the five-month war, Mr. Putin, the certain favorite in Russia's March 26 presidential elections, gave no ground as Mr. Blair pressed for peace talks with Chechen rebels. </p> <p> PublicAffairs, a New York company that is fast becoming the publishing house for Kremlin politicians, is preparing to rush into print in May with an English translation of the memoirs describing the life, travails and cold war spying adventures of Russia's acting president, Vladimir V. Putin. </p> <p> The original Russian version of ''First Person,'' is still unavailable in Russia, where the country's Central Electoral Commission has temporarily barred publication until after the March 26 presidential election. </p> <p> When Acting President Vladimir V. Putin met behind closed doors last month with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, he made an unusual appeal that Russia be considered a member of the Western club. </p> <p> Mr. Putin said he liked to eat Chinese food, knew how to use chopsticks and regularly practiced judo. </p> <p> As a sudden blizzard added unexpected drama to Russia's presidential elections, voters strolling through the grounds of the Trinity Monastery of St. Sergius summed up the reasons why Vladimir V. Putin will be elected Russia's next leader, if not today, then in a second round on April 16. </p> <p> Many said they liked him for his decisiveness. Others applauded his discipline, his energy or his relative youth. </p> <p> Acting President Vladimir V. Putin  won a narrow majority of the vote today in Russia's presidential election, gaining the outright victory that the Kremlin had pursued with growing desperation to avoid a runoff next month. </p> <p> Although Mr. Putin's anticlimactic triumph was huge in absolute terms -- some 20 percentage points ahead of his closest rival, the Communist leader Gennadi A. Zyuganov -- it appeared likely to fall considerably short of expectations. And that further elevated doubts, which had begun to surface in the campaign's final days, about the depth of Mr. Putin's popular support. </p> <p> Vladimir V. Putin, Russia's acting president, in his first interview with a Western news organization, says Russia must be a ''strong, powerful state'' that sheds confrontational cold war politics, avoids isolation from the West and remains willing to seek ''more profound integration'' with NATO even by joining it so long as Russia ''is regarded as an equal partner.'' </p> <p> Seated in an armchair in the Kremlin, Mr. Putin recorded the interview last Tuesday with Sir David Frost of the British Broadcasting Corporation. It was broadcast today, and was also picked up by Russian television networks. </p> <p> With a hefty lead in the polls, Vladimir V. Putin has perfected his campaign strategy -- act presidential, shun televised debates and mock some of the other rituals of electoral politics. </p> <p> The tactics of the acting, and almost certainly future, president were on display today on a visit to Ivanovo, a down-at-the-heels textile factory town 180 miles northeast of here. </p> <p> With less than one month to go before Russians vote in an election that is almost certain to be won by Acting President Vladimir V. Putin, some of the liberals who hailed his rise are voicing fears that there may be authoritarian instincts lurking beneath Mr Putin's well-turned democratic phrases. </p> <p> With a war raging in Chechnya on Russia's southern border, tight restrictions imposed on information and a propaganda campaign glorifying the military and security services, members of Russia's small liberal elite say that Mr. Putin's pledges to observe human rights and to respect legal and democratic norms are still promises waiting to be fulfilled. </p> <p> Not Marx, not Lenin, but a hit movie of 1968 set a teenager named Vladimir V. Putin on the road to his career as a K.G.B. agent. </p> <p> Or at least that is how Mr. Putin, now Russia's acting president and the favorite in the election on March 26, described how, in ninth grade, he was smitten by the romance of working for the secret service. The movie, ''The Sword and the Shield,'' depicted the heroic deeds of a Soviet double agent in Nazi Germany. </p> <p> With President-elect Vladimir V. Putin moving to put his government in place, Moscow is rife with behind-the-scenes intrigue as he and his aides try to decide which politicians, economists and tycoons should be included in his inner circle. </p> <p> But Mr. Putin has made it clear that he will be in no hurry to decide everything. And in his first major personnel decision today, he caught the capital's attention with a change that he did not make: He decided not to replace Marshal Igor D. Sergeyev, the defense minister. </p> <p> If he is elected president on Sunday, as everyone expects he will be, Vladimir V. Putin says he will use a trusted group of former colleagues from the K.G.B. to tackle Russia's endemic corruption. </p> <p> ''I am bringing into my inner-circle people from law enforcement bodies who are in no way connected with the people and structures which may be associated with any form of corruption,'' the acting president said. </p> <p> As President-elect Vladimir V. Putin flew north beyond the Arctic Circle this week to ride a nuclear-powered submarine and burnish his image as commander in chief, the event that was making political waves was the scuttling of his hand-picked candidate for governor of his home region here. </p> <p> In a humbling concession to the political strength and popularity of the incumbent governor, Vladimir Yakovlev, Mr. Putin recalled Valentina Matviyenko, his first deputy prime minister, from her vacation on Tuesday and, according to Ms. Matviyenko, asked her to pull out of the race she had entered with the Kremlin's blessing less than a month ago. </p> <p> First came horror, then instant history: Russia's new president Vladimir Putin is taking an electronic page from Stephen King and is preparing to issue his translated memoirs in a digital book that will be available at the end of April. </p> <p> The New Age Russian president and former K.G.B. spy is also considering another technical innovation to drop the veil on the facts of his own life: chat room discussions with Internet users on the MSNBC Web site. </p> <p> The phrase most often used by friend and foe alike to describe British Prime Minister Tony Blair is ''control freak.'' </p> <p> He tightly controls the flow of all government information from 10 Downing Street, and put in a financial supporter to chair the BBC. He ''devolved'' power to Scotland and Wales so as to make most of that leadership loyal to him. He abolished hereditary peers so that power in Britain's conservative House of Lords would shift to his Labor appointees. </p> <p> In a sign that Russia is looking for a political solution to its war in Chechnya, President-elect Vladimir V. Putin acknowledged today for the first time that Moscow had exchanged peace plans with the Chechen president, Aslan Maskhadov. </p> <p> Mr. Putin, speaking to reporters, said he still regards Mr. Maskhadov as a ''criminal,'' but one who could be pardoned. And he indicated that his government is ready to talk with a man who seven months ago, at the start of the second Chechen war, was considered politically irrelevant. </p> <p> In an unusual display of political unity, the Russian Parliament today handed President-elect Vladimir V. Putin his third overwhelming vote in a week ratifying a major arms control accord. The vote set the stage for a diplomatic campaign to put the United States on the defensive in nuclear disarmament talks. </p> <p> By a vote of 298 to 74, the lower house of Parliament ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty that the United States Senate rejected last October. In the last seven days, Mr. Putin won ratification in both the upper and lower houses of a strategic arms reduction accord that calls for halving the American and Russian arsenals to no more than 3,500 warheads each. </p> <p> In his first official trip since being elected president, Vladimir V. Putin visited one of Russia's leading nuclear weapons design centers and vowed to preserve the nation's nuclear might. </p> <p> ''We must increase the efficiency of our nuclear potential,'' Mr. Putin said at a meeting at the Chelyabinsk-70 complex near here, where thousands of nuclear scientists live and work behind a barricade of barbed wire. </p> <p> In his first visit to the West since winning office, Russia's president-elect, Vladimir V. Putin, today courted foreign businessmen, met with the queen and offered some unsolicited advice on the stock market. </p> <p> Eager to burnish his economic credentials and overcome Western suspicion about his K.G.B. past, he dismissed Friday's rout on Wall Street as little more than a blip. </p> <p> The Russian political analyst Sergei Markov was trying to explain to me over tea the other day the state of the Russian state: ''If you look at it from far away,'' he said, ''the Russian state looks like a big [Charles] Atlas, full of muscles. But as you get closer you realize that this Atlas is actually dead. Inside, this huge body is full of worms, who are eating the body and feeding off it. Sometimes an arm or a leg moves a little, but that's not because Atlas is alive, it's because the worms have moved an arm or leg. It's a very depressing and ugly state.'' </p> <p> I'll say. Mr. Markov's imagery may be overdrawn, but it's not all that far from the truth. The most important story in Russia today is what has happened to the Russian state. It has been privatized, and, like everything else, in the worst possible way. </p> <p> Last week, President-elect Vladimir V. Putin pushed the long-awaited ratification of a major arms control treaty through a compliant lower house of Parliament. Today, he scored a victory with regional bosses in Parliament's upper chamber, easily winning a vote to get rid of a prosecutor who was the scourge of former President Boris N. Yeltsin's Kremlin. </p> <p> For good measure, the upper house also approved the nuclear arms reduction agreement known as Start II, which passed the lower house last Friday. </p> <p> The most vivid display of loyalty from the governors and local leaders in the Federation Council, as the upper house is called, was their 133-to-10 vote to dismiss Yuri I. Skuratov, the general prosecutor whom Mr. Yeltsin tried twice to fire last year after he began to investigate corruption in the Kremlin itself. </p> <p> In six weeks, the cock-of-the-walk president of Russia and the lame-duck president of the U.S. will hold what Churchill called ''a parley at the summit'' in Moscow. </p> <p> The central subject: Russia's need to cut the cost of maintaining thousands of missiles aimed at the U.S., and America's need for limited defense against rogue-nation missiles. </p> <p> For 50 years the old master drawings lay tucked away under a bed in a provincial Russian city, the guilty secret of an anonymous Soviet Army officer who scooped them up from the basement of a German castle at the end of World War II as the army made its way home from Berlin. </p> <p> And the 18th-century mosaic of semiprecious stones is one of four that graced the walls of the toffee-colored Amber Room in a palace outside St. Petersburg until 1941, when the entire room was dismantled and carted away by the occupying German Army. </p> <p> Gov. George W. Bush met with the Russian foreign minister today, airing differences over a missile defense system and Chechnya but still expressing hope that the two nuclear powers ''can work together to keep peace in the world.'' </p> <p> For Mr. Bush, who has faced sustained questions about his inexperience in foreign affairs, the hourlong session with the Russian, Igor S. Ivanov, was his second venture into the field this week. On Monday he dedicated a bridge over the Rio Grande and shared a stage with President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico. </p> <p> Vladimir V. Putin, in his first legislative initiative as Russia's elected president, today won approval of the long-delayed nuclear arms reduction treaty known as Start II from the lower house of Parliament. The landmark agreement, which was negotiated seven years ago, calls for cutting the American and Russian nuclear arsenals by half. </p> <p> The passage was seen as a sign that Mr. Putin seeks a constructive relationship with the West but also that he intends to resist the United States program to develop and deploy antimissile defenses. </p> <p> The Clinton administration today welcomed Russia's ratification of the nuclear arms reduction treaty known as Start II, saying it sets the stage for President Clinton and President-elect Vladimir V. Putin to meet to try to hammer out a grand bargain for the next stage of arms control. </p> <p> Senior administration officials said they were that pleased Mr. Putin, unlike his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin, demonstrated that he could deal with Parliament and that in the president-elect's appearance before the legislators he told them Russia could not afford an arms race. </p> <p> Russian security agents arrested an unidentified American citizen and a Russian described as his accomplice on spying charges today, and were holding both men in Lefortovo Prison in Moscow. </p> <p> In a statement, the Russian domestic security agency accused the American, described as the head of a private company, of having ''deliberately established contacts over a long period with Russian scientists'' in order to obtain state secrets. The Russian was described as a specialist in the Russian defense industry. </p> <p> The victory of Vladimir V. Putin in the presidential election last Sunday has focused attention on an opulent Moscow building known as Aleksandr House, where a team of liberal-minded economists and other experts has been quietly drafting Mr. Putin's blueprint for Russia. </p> <p> German O. Gref, head of the Center for Strategic Research and master of Aleksandr House, confidently predicted this week that by late May Mr. Putin will be ready to release ''a breakthrough scenario envisaging the most radical reforms,'' from an overhaul of Russia's cumbersome tax code to a streamlining of its infamous bureaucracies. </p> <p> The International Monetary Fund is ready to pursue a new relationship with Russia as soon as President-elect Vladimir V. Putin acts on his promise to build a better foundation for the country's still shaky market economy, a top official of the organization said today. </p> <p> Since last fall, the fund has held off providing new credits to Russia, insisting that its government and Central Bank first tackle long-promised changes that would restore international confidence in the way business is done here. </p> <p> In their first meeting as the new leaders of Russia and Japan, President-elect Vladimir V. Putin and Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori pledged today to meet often, to call each other by their nicknames and to try to conclude a long-sought peace treaty by the end of the year. </p> <p> Such a treaty would formally end decades of antagonism between the countries over a group of islands seized by Russia at the end of World War II. In making the pledge, both leaders were reaffirming the commitment of their predecessors to reach that goal. </p> <p> In the first major test of a new and more centrist parliamentary majority, President-elect Vladimir V. Putin reached agreement today with his legislative allies to bring a long-delayed nuclear arms reduction treaty to a ratification vote in Parliament as early as Friday. </p> <p> Proponents of ratifying the treaty, known as Start II, predicted that they had the votes to win. The decision to move forward immediately with the vote in the wake of Mr. Putin's victory in the presidential election last month was hailed as a significant advance for arms control,  an agenda that a Communist-led coalition that dominated the Parliament has blocked for five years. </p> <p> Federal agents wielding guns and wearing black masks staged a raid on the downtown headquarters of Russia's largest private media empire today, raising alarms among politicians and journalists about the prospects for an independent press under President Vladimir V. Putin. </p> <p> The corporate offices of Media-MOST, a holding company that has been in and out of political favor with the Kremlin for years, controls influential radio and television stations as well as a newspaper, a news magazine and other publications, were still being searched tonight as top law enforcement officials issued conflicting statements on the purpose of the criminal investigation. </p> <p> Moving swiftly to gather the reins of power in Kremlin hands, President Vladimir V. Putin proposed legislation tonight that would oust Russia's provincial governors from their seats in Parliament and, in some instances, permit him to fire them altogether. </p> <p> The plan to redraw Parliament's upper house, called the Federation Council, would replace its 178 governors and regional legislative leaders with lower-level appointees from each of the nation's 89 regions. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin named as prime minister today a chief foreign-debt negotiator and a liberal economics expert. The long predicted move, some experts said, bodes well for efforts to tame Russia's feral style of capitalism. </p> <p> That view was bolstered by a separate report today that Mr. Putin might abolish the Fuel and Energy Ministry as he reorganizes the cabinet. The immensely powerful agency has often been attacked as a seat of corruption and a brake on capitalist reforms. </p> <p> The Pentagon is assessing the risk to national security of cutting its nuclear arsenal to 2,000 warheads under an arms-reduction treaty with Russia, a step that could help President Clinton broker a missile-defense deal with Moscow before he leaves office, administration officials say. </p> <p> The highly classified review has been under way for months, but it has intensified in recent weeks in advance of Mr. Clinton's scheduled summit meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin early next month in Moscow. </p> <p> Beneath a gilded sunburst in a gilded palace, his hand on a red, leather-bound copy of the Constitution, Vladimir V. Putin swore an oath today to ''respect and guard the human and civil rights'' of Russia and became, officially at last, its second president. </p> <p> Much of Russia -- and the world -- now waits to see what he will do with the title. Many expect a quick push to overhaul Russia's inscrutable tax code and economy and to reassert Kremlin rule over its 89 provinces -- goals supposedly too risky to chase when he was but an acting leader. </p> <p> Days before Vladimir V. Putin's swearing-in as Russia's second president, a Moscow newspaper has published what purports to be a Kremlin proposal to use the K.G.B.'s successor agency as a weapon against political foes, journalists and others who stand in the way of ''real control'' of Russian politics and society. </p> <p> Among other things, the proposal speculates that the government's special services could smear opponents who have damaging information about the Kremlin leadership and gather ''special information'' about potential candidates for high office. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin moved today to assert sweeping control over Russia's far-flung and often headstrong provinces, decreeing that they be organized into seven vast administrative districts, each overseen by a powerful Kremlin representative. </p> <p> It is Mr. Putin's second attempt in a week to rein in the 89 provinces, and it seems quite likely to stir protest among their elected governors, some of whom rule like potentates. </p> <p> The first time Vladimir V. Putin deserted Moscow and staged a meeting with a visiting head of state here, Russians hardly noticed. </p> <p> That was in March, when Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain came to the city that Peter the Great built and that served as Russia's capital for two centuries. The Russian and British leaders strolled with their wives into the Mariinsky Theater and from the imperial vantage point of the czar's former box they watched the gala opening of the opera ''War and Peace.'' </p> <p> Vladimir Kalamanov may have the toughest job in Russia. As the Kremlin's special envoy for human rights, his task is to persuade a skeptical West that Russia is serious about ending human rights abuses in Chechnya. </p> <p> It is a hard sell. Despite numerous accounts of pillaging, beatings and killings by Russian troops in Chechnya, only a handful of cases have been investigated by military prosecutors. And while Mr. Kalamanov insists he is making progress, he is the first to acknowledge that the Russian military routinely withholds critical details of investigations. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin today offered a backhanded defense of a police raid at the corporate headquarters of Russia's largest private media empire, noting in a statement that ''all are equal before the law, no matter what business they are in.'' </p> <p> The raid Thursday by federal agents at several corporate offices owned by Media-MOST, a holding company controlled by Vladimir Gusinsky, continued to draw criticism today as even rival newspapers condemned the government for trying to intimidate its critics in the press. </p> <p> In Poland, long a trophy of East-West competition and now one of NATO's newest members, the installation of Vladimir Putin as Russia's president has raised new questions about Moscow's intentions. </p> <p> Mr. Putin has signaled a desire to improve relations between the former Warsaw Pact allies, making telephone calls to the Polish president and showing new openness about the killing of Polish officers during World War II by the Soviets at Katyn, Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek said. </p> <p> With Air Force One scheduled to land in Moscow later this week, President Clinton still has not faced the fact that his policy of ''engagement'' with Russia has become a colossal disappointment. But in his visit to Moscow, he will encounter that reality face to face, when he is greeted by President Vladimir Putin, a former colonel in the K.G.B., the son of a party apparatchik as well of the grandson of a trusted member of Lenin's and then Stalin's personal detail. </p> <p> Let it be said that in the area of relations with Russia, Mr. Clinton deserves some credit. The denuclearization of Ukraine and Belarus and the reductions of strategic forces by both the United States and Russia were negotiated with persistence and success. Ukraine's independence has been strongly supported. The United States expanded its relations with independent states in the southern Caucasus and Central Asia. Most important, under Mr. Clinton's leadership, NATO was enlarged eastward, and the administration has pledged to continue that expansion, including the Baltic states. </p> <p> 'Millionaire' Vs. 'Survivor' </p> <p> ABC is making one thing clear tonight: It may be in the business of making millionaires, but not at CBS. </p> <p> As CBS kicks off its island survival test, ''Survivor,'' at 8 tonight -- a show that CBS clearly hopes will become this summer's phenomenon, as ''Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' was for ABC last summer -- ABC has decided to make that goal as elusive as possible. </p> <p> It turns out that the most momentous act of Vladimir V. Putin's first days as Russia's elected president has not been his choice of a cabinet, or the internal debate over a sweeping economic restructuring plan, or even the approval of two nuclear arms treaties. </p> <p> Rather, it is Mr. Putin's mounting of a swift and stunning crusade last week to gut the power and political influence of Russia's 89 governors -- and not coincidentally, perhaps, to enhance his own. </p> <p> Barring a sudden change of heart, President Vladimir Putin of Russia will do the United States a great service when he sits down with President Clinton this weekend and refuses to modify the Antiballistic Missile Treaty to allow the United States to deploy a limited missile defense. </p> <p> Why does Russian opposition work in America's interest? We are still in the early stages of a serious debate over a national defense against missile attacks and, more broadly, over our nuclear strategy in the new century. Without a consensus on these important points, it is simply wrong to cut a deal with Moscow, either now or in the remaining months of the Clinton presidency. </p> <p> Russia's lower house of Parliament ignored misgivings by political analysts and democracy advocates today and resoundingly endorsed a first draft of President Vladimir V. Putin's plan to concentrate state power in the Kremlin. </p> <p> The wave of support strongly suggests that Russia's upper house of Parliament, the Federation Council -- which stands to lose much of its power to the Kremlin should the plan pass -- will be more or less helpless to do anything about it. </p> <p> For the ''last remaining superpower,'' it is time to ask the Ed Koch question, ''How am I doing?'' The answer is, ''O.K., but not great.'' Ten years after victory in the cold war, the United States is still No. 1 by any conceivable measure. But the lesser actors -- Russia, Europe, China -- are beginning to make true what history and political theory have predicted all along: Great power will generate ''ganging up.'' Nos. 2, 3 and 4 will seek to balance against Mr. Big. </p> <p> Just last week, President Vladimir Putin of Russia swept into Berlin, where he deftly executed a classic gambit of Muscovite diplomacy. This is the age-old attempt to forge privileged relations with Germany, the traditional holder of the European balance. He wooed, and he won. ''Germany,'' Mr. Putin intoned, ''is Russia's leading partner in Europe and the world.'' Chancellor Gerhard Schroder cooed back; he, too, was all for a ''strategic partnership'' with Russia. </p> <p> In what looks to many here like a twilight struggle over the future of free speech, the Kremlin has handed one journalist over to Chechen guerrillas, demanded that newspapers obtain federal licenses and, on Tuesday, slapped Russia's leading press baron in a notoriously lice-ridden prison. </p> <p> But the litmus test of the Kremlin's intentions may be whether it tries to crack down on a bunch of grotesque, legless latex dolls. </p> <p> Russia's most powerful businessmen today condemned the arrest of Vladimir A. Gusinsky, the owner of Russia's leading independent media conglomerate, and warned that it threatened the nation's hard-won freedoms. </p> <p> ''Until yesterday we believed that we lived in a democratic country and today we have serious doubts,'' 17 tycoons said in a letter to Russia's prosecutor-general. </p> <p> Vladimir V. Putin arrived here today, greeted by newspaper headlines like ''Putin the German'' that suggested the intense hopes vested by Germany in a Russian president who long resided in Dresden. </p> <p> That Mr. Putin speaks German --  learned during his K.G.B. days in East Germany -- has been impossible to ignore. ''The second German-speaking Russian leader after Lenin,'' enthused Die Zeit, noting that all of Mr. Putin's children have been sent to German schools. </p> <p> Leaving President Clinton behind in Moscow, Vladimir V. Putin came to Rome today to sell Europe -- and the Vatican -- on a Russian alternative to the United States missile defense proposal. </p> <p> The two-day trip was timed to follow his somewhat tense discussions with Mr. Clinton about altering the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. And it was choreographed to put Mr. Putin's heightened sense of Russian power on display. He left for Rome one hour before his American guest flew to Ukraine, kept John Paul II waiting 20 minutes and used his meeting with Italian officials as an opportunity to use Europe as a wedge in Russia's arms control negotiations with the United States. </p> <p> Westerners cap the salutations of their business letters with a colon, to wit: Dear Mr. Doe:. Not so Russians, who fire off important missives with gunpowder, as with ''Respected Rodion Romanovich!'' or ''Dear Mrs. Raskolnikov!'' </p> <p> The exclamation point is a flyspeck of formality, a nit of politesse. When Anya Provorova, a 17-year-old from a four-street village in Russia's north, dashed off a letter last month that began, ''Respected Vladimir Vladimirovich'' -- no exclamation point, no colon, no comma -- she thought nothing more of it. </p> <p> A battle over Unified Energy Systems, Russia's electricity monopoly, intensified today after a group of foreign investors who oppose a plan to overhaul the company took their case to the Kremlin. The government controls more than half the company. </p> <p> Investors representing about 15 percent of the company's stock met with Aleksandr Voloshin, the Kremlin chief of staff. Mr. Voloshin, an important figure in President Vladimir V. Putin's administration, is also chairman of Unified Energy's board. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin had barely said farewell to President Clinton this week before the Russian leader and top aides fanned out across Europe to campaign against American plans for a national missile defense. </p> <p> On whirlwind trips to Brussels and Rome, the Russians sought to persuade the Europeans that a blend of diplomacy, vigilance and Russian technology is a better way to cope with the emerging missile threat. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said today that prosecutors had gone ''too far'' in jailing the owner of Russia's largest independent media company two days ago. </p> <p> ''I personally believe that this is excessive,'' Mr. Putin said during his state visit to Berlin. ''I think it should have been possible to handle this without an arrest.'' </p> <p> Vladimir A. Gusinsky, the media tycoon whose arrest last week raised fears of a press crackdown, refused to answer prosecutors' questions today. </p> <p> The prosecutors say Mr. Gusinsky helped defraud the government. </p> <p> President Clinton and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia concluded two days of talks today with mutual praise, but without narrowing the differences over the national missile defense system the United States wants to build. </p> <p> The summit meeting did produce two other narrow but significant agreements. One was an undertaking by the United States and Russia each to destroy 34 metric tons (about 75,000 pounds) of weapons-grade plutonium, enough to make tens of thousands of nuclear weapons. The other called for a joint center in Moscow to share early warnings about missile launching, a center that would be the first permanent American-Russia military operation. </p> <p> Seeking to lower expectations, Clinton administration officials had insisted that two days of talks with President Vladimir V. Putin should not be viewed as an arms control summit meeting. But they were. </p> <p> The main purpose was to soften the Kremlin's resistance to American plans for a limited missile defense and to pave the way for a new arms control framework by the end of the Clinton presidency. </p> <p> Hours before he flew to Moscow on Friday, President Clinton pointedly observed in a speech in Berlin that Westerners ''do not yet know if Russia's hard-won democratic freedoms will endure.'' Today, with a few muted gestures, the White House illustrated what he meant. </p> <p> This morning, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright visited Radio Liberty, the United States-financed broadcaster whose blunt coverage of the war in Chechnya last winter led to the Russians' detention of a top reporter, Andrei Babitsky. </p> <p> Before meeting with business leaders in Milan, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia worked on some unfinished business concerning Rome today, explaining to Italians why he had not explicitly invited Pope John Paul II to Russia. </p> <p> ''We do not want in any way to harm the discussion in progress between the Orthodox Church and the Catholic one,'' Mr. Putin said in Milan. In Rome earlier, he said, on the same subject, ''We must proceed with caution and not do harm in attempting to do good.'' </p> <p> The Kremlin's chief prosecutor today arrested and jailed Vladimir A. Gusinsky, head of a media empire that has sharply criticized the government. </p> <p> The arrest roused fears of suppression of the press. But President Vladimir V. Putin, traveling abroad, insisted that the arrest was an unwelcome surprise to him. </p> <p> Russian officials have told the United States that they are developing a system that is capable of shooting down ballistic missiles soon after they are launched, a senior United States official said today. </p> <p> Moscow has yet to provide details about the new system, but after weeks of vague and confusing statements, the Russians have finally begun to flesh out their plan in meetings here with Defense Secretary William S. Cohen. </p> <p> Let us hear no more about the enigmatic Vladimir Putin. The president of Russia is as plain as a glass of tea. He is an autocrat in a tough spot, looking for order. </p> <p> Madeleine Albright called him ''one of Russia's leading reformers.'' So he is, but with a hyphen. His purpose is to re-form Russia, bringing it into the modern era as a nonideological descendant of its Soviet predecessor. </p> <p> A group of foreign investors in Russia's electricity monopoly, Unified Energy Systems, has asked President Vladimir V. Putin to stop a corporate restructuring the investors say is moving too fast and would destroy the value of their holdings. </p> <p> The group of 18 investors, representing more than 15 percent of Unified Energy's stock, sent a letter to Mr. Putin stating that the restructuring proposal would reduce future investment levels in the energy sector by robbing the company of its principal assets at extremely low prices. The identities of all the foreign investors that signed the letter were not immediately clear. But people who had seen a copy said it included some of the most prominent names in the asset management business -- Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Templeton and Baring Asset Management. </p> <p> The owner of Russia's largest independent media conglomerate appeared on his NTV network today in a live call-in show and charged that he was arrested and jailed last week at the behest of President Vladimir V. Putin. </p> <p> ''I am sure that Putin knew,'' said  the media owner, Vladimir Gusinsky. ''Moreover, the decision was made personally by Mr. President.'' </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin appointed a Muslim cleric today to govern Chechnya, a move intended to legitimize the Russian intervention in the breakaway republic and to help the Kremlin tighten its grip on the region. </p> <p> Mr. Putin said the new leader, Mufti Akhmed Kadyrov, a Chechen, would have the support of his people. But many Chechens distrust leaders who have sided with the Russians, and it will be difficult for him to establish authority. </p> <p> I had breakfast recently with the deputy chief of Media-Most, the last major Russian TV-and-newspaper company to dare criticize or satirize the men who have ''democratically'' seized power in the Kremlin. </p> <p> Igor Malashenko was at first unusually guarded, speaking as if being overheard by the new K.G.B. I asked: What's with the clamming up? He responded by asking if I carried a cell phone. Sure, I said, but it was turned off; I prefer to be out of touch. </p> <p> The Clinton administration is exploring with some of its NATO allies and Russia the possibility that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia be allowed to leave office with guarantees for his safety and his savings, senior American and NATO officials say. </p> <p> The discussions are delicate and informal, the officials stress, emphasizing that the administration is not preparing any offer to Mr. Milosevic -- who has been indicted by an international war crimes tribunal -- and will not make one. </p> <p> In his final visit to Moscow as president, Bill Clinton arrived here today and dined tonight with Russia's new president, Vladimir V. Putin, at the Kremlin palace, where the two leaders made a ''very serious and focused beginning'' on a full range of issues, including the search for a compromise on antimissile defense. </p> <p> During a nearly three-hour working dinner, the two men also discussed the American-Russian nuclear relationship, ongoing conflicts in the Balkans and the Caucasus, international trade and the state of the Russian economy, said a senior Administration official who sat in on the talks. </p> <p> The Russian media magnate Vladimir A. Gusinsky was released from a Moscow jail tonight, four days after an arrest that raised alarms about the prospects for press freedom in Russia and presented President Vladimir V. Putin with the first political challenge of his young presidency. </p> <p> Mr. Gusinsky, the 47-year-old owner of Media-Most, a group of influential newspaper, radio and television interests that has at times been harshly critical of the Kremlin, left the shabby Butyrka prison in Moscow about 10 p.m. after signing a letter promising not to leave the capital. </p> <p> ''What do you want us to say,'' President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia asked today after his fourth meeting in three days with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany, ''that we're in love?'' </p> <p> He was joking, of course. But there was no mistake that the summit meeting that ended today produced a vigorous rapprochement between Russia and Germany. Mr. Putin seemed entirely serious when he added, ''Germany is Russia's leading partner in Europe and the world.'' </p> <p> Gazprom, Russia's biggest company, began a campaign of pressure today against the owner of the nation's largest independent media conglomerate, demanding that his company repay a large debt. </p> <p> The move came a week after Vladimir A. Gusinsky, the media tycoon, was jailed on charges of embezzlement. He was released pending trial.  But he has expressed concern to associates that he will face more pressure, and President Vladimir V. Putin has called on Gazprom, a financial supporter, to take a tough stand toward Mr. Gusinsky's company. </p> <p> In a bid to recast a security debate just before his summit meeting with President Clinton, President Vladimir V. Putin has suggested an alternative to the proposed American defense against missile attack by nations like North Korea. </p> <p> Agreeing with the American assessment that so-called rogue states pose a nuclear threat, Mr. Putin hinted that the United States and Russia could collaborate on new ways to shoot down enemy missiles soon after they were launched, rather than in space. The Russian proposal is intended to replace the plan for a nationwide shield to protect the United States against incoming warheads that the Clinton administration has proposed. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin plans to visit North Korea next month, a move that underscores his active foreign policy and seems calculated to counter the Clinton administration's plan for a national missile defense. </p> <p> Russian officials said today that it would be the first trip by a Russian leader to the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin convened a meeting with Russian tycoons today to impress on them that he, ultimately, is the one who runs the country. </p> <p> At the end of the session at the Kremlin, some business leaders said they were prepared to forgo special treatment and abide by government rules -- if the Kremlin would create a fairer business climate. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin made a surprise trip to the Mozdok military base near Chechnya tonight to review the deteriorating security situation in the breakaway republic. </p> <p> He convened a meeting of top aides, a presidential spokesman said, to consider military and economic steps to secure Russia's hold on Chechnya, where Russian forces have waged a 10-month campaign against separatist rebels. </p> <p> After two months of maneuvering, President Vladimir V. Putin and 89 of Russia's most powerful leaders -- the nation's czar-like regional governors -- faced off today in a long-anticipated political showdown. </p> <p> It was not even a contest. </p> <p> No one outside the Kremlin is quite sure why, or what it portends, or even whether it will last very long. But after nine long years of fabulous high living and seeming immunity from the rules that govern mere mortals, Russia's infamous tycoons have suddenly found themselves marked men. </p> <p> At least, some have. Whether they continue to be targets will say much about whether President Vladimir V. Putin's much-vaunted ''dictatorship of the law'' is in fact that or is more in the mold of the last Kremlin, where the rich played by their own laws. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia arrived in Beijing tonight on the first stop of an Asian tour intended to revive his country's faded diplomatic role in the region and build what could become a Chinese-Russian axis to counter American influence. </p> <p> Mr. Putin is expected to sign at least six accords with Chinese leaders on Tuesday, including a joint statement with President Jiang Zemin condemning American proposals for missile defense systems over North America and Asia. Opposition to the American plan has accelerated a relationship that Russia and China describe as a ''strategic partnership'' intended to counter American power. </p> <p> Boris A. Berezovsky, the archetypal Russian tycoon, politician and, until lately, a force within the Kremlin itself, said today that he would quit his seat in Parliament on Wednesday and try to form an alliance of big business and regional politicians aimed at curbing President Vladimir V. Putin's growing power. </p> <p> Mr. Berezovsky said flatly that he was resigning because ''I do not wish to take part in the dismantling of Russia and the imposition of authoritarian rule.'' </p> <p> In an announcement intended to remove the prime rationale for an American missile defense plan, Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, said today that North Korea had offered to abandon its missile program if other nations would provide it with rockets to launch satellites into space. </p> <p> Mr. Putin announced the offer after a meeting in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, with that country's leader, Kim Jong Il. The visit was a first for a Russian president and was part of an intensive round of Asian diplomacy aimed at mobilizing opposition to the American antimissile plan. On Tuesday, Mr. Putin signed a joint statement with the Chinese denouncing the United States' plans for a missile defense. </p> <p> Russia's government strengthened its influence over the natural gas giant Gazprom today, loosening the grip of an entrenched management that shareholders say has ignored their interests and obscured the company's operations. </p> <p> The government's increased control of the company, the nation's biggest, came in a shareholder vote for a new board., The move reflects a broader effort by President Vladimir V. Putin to exert more authority over the country's most important companies like Gazprom, Russia's biggest earner of cash and the supplier of a quarter of Western Europe's natural gas. </p> <p> The lower house of Parliament voted solidly today to give the Kremlin the right to fire any of Russia's 89 regional governors for cause, handing President Vladimir V. Putin another powerful weapon in his bid to centralize power in Moscow. </p> <p> The lower house, or Duma, voted 399 to 9 in favor of the proposal, which now goes to the upper house. The landslide vote means that the measure almost certainly will become law no matter how the upper house votes, because the Duma would need only 300 votes to override action by the upper house. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin assembled both houses of Parliament and a national television audience today to present his assessment of the state of the nation. In a word, it was forbidding. </p> <p> After 10 years of independence, he said, Russians have built only ''the carcass of a civic society'' and have yet to shoulder such basic obligations as obeying laws. A falling birthrate and aging population threaten to make Russia ''a senile nation.'' The economy, which lately has perked up, actually is a house of cards supported by high oil prices. </p> <p> At the summit meeting here of eight world leaders, where the focus was unremittingly on harmony, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia met with President Clinton on Friday night to argue against American deployment of a national missile shield. </p> <p> The two met during a break in the Group of 8 meeting under way here in Okinawa. National missile defense was the most attention-getting issue, because it exposed a rift in a well-scripted gathering. </p> <p> Russian prosecutors today abruptly dropped their high-profile criminal inquiry into Vladimir V. Gusinsky, the Russian press tycoon whose Media-Most empire has been among the Kremlin's sharpest critics. </p> <p> Prosecutors did not explain why they had abandoned the investigation, which began with a spectacular May raid by ski-masked policemen and caused an uproar in June with Mr. Gusinsky's brief imprisonment on embezzlement charges. As recently as three weeks ago, prosecutors insisted to Parliament that Mr. Gusinsky had defrauded the government of at least $10 million. </p> <p> Boris A. Berezovsky, the top Russian executive and onetime insider, who has denounced a Kremlin crackdown on rich businessmen, received a measure of vindication today when international auditors exonerated one of his companies in a long-running investigation into embezzlement and money laundering. </p> <p> But authorities here intend to press ahead with the investigation anyway, one of several that reflect an intensified scrutiny under President Vladimir V. Putin of the wealthy oligarchs that control much of the business in post-Soviet Russia. </p> <p> Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, warned today that inflation is rising an annual rate of nearly 35 percent, a trend economists say could severely strain incomes of ordinary Russians. </p> <p> Mr. Putin, who is making his first attempts at formulating economic policy, was quoted as suggesting at a Kremlin meeting that the government should take steps to slow the pace of inflation. </p> <p> The Russian authorities brought tax evasion charges against top executives at the country's biggest carmaker today as part of President Vladimir V. Putin's efforts to loosen the grip of Russia's richest men on the country's most profitable enterprises. </p> <p> The executives of the carmaker, AvtoVAZ, were charged a day after the authorities filed suit against managers at Russia's biggest oil company, also on charges of tax evasion. Since May, the authorities have swept through offices of media and oil companies and have brought charges against some of them. </p> <p> Stung by rising casualties, President Vladimir V. Putin promised today to reduce the use of Russian policemen in Chechnya and turn over more law enforcement responsibilities to pro-Moscow Chechens. </p> <p> Mr. Putin's pledge followed a recent string of bombings that killed at least 33 Russian troops and police officers, including members of a police unit from Chelyabinsk, a city in the Russian Urals. </p> <p> Earlier this summer, the newly elected Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, flew to Tatarstan to take part in the planting festival known as Sabantui. There he donned a Tatar hat, stuck his face in a vat of yogurt to bob for coins and then engaged a Tatar girl in arm wrestling. </p> <p> What happened next simply astounded Prof. Aleksandr B. Asmolov, a leading psychologist at Moscow State University, who watched on television as Mr. Putin, a black belt in judo, did not hesitate or politely feign a struggle, but simply slammed her arm to the table in a single overpowering motion. </p> <p> Russian naval forces failed again today to dock a rescue vehicle onto the sunken and disabled submarine Kursk as President Vladimir V. Putin ordered his military commanders to accept Western offers of assistance. </p> <p> No signal was heard during the day from the 118 crew members, and hopes were fading that any of them would be able to cling to life as high winds and stormy weather hindered rescue efforts in the Barents Sea. </p> <p> When Norwegian divers opened the emergency escape hatch on the sunken Russian submarine on Sunday, they had done in a day what Russian rescue workers had not managed in a week. The tragic story of the Kursk is only the latest evidence that Russia can no longer afford to maintain the technology created in the Soviet Union. </p> <p> The Kursk was a quintessential Soviet creation, huge as the superpower's ambition, equipped to destroy entire groups of vessels many times its own size -- and, of course, top-secret. But we now know that for years the sub has been going to sea without even the required emergency food and water supplies on board. </p> <p> Speaking in somber tones and at times struggling for words, Russia's defense minister, Marshal Igor D. Sergeyev, offered a defense tonight of the military's failure to rescue the crew of the stricken nuclear submarine Kursk. In a nationally televised interview, he told Russians that the armed forces of the once-powerful Soviet empire had been ''robbed and stripped'' in the last decade and were operating on half the budget they required. </p> <p> After divers finally gained entry to the wreck of the nuclear submarine Kursk today and declared it flooded and its 118-member crew dead, the 68-year-old Marshal Sergeyev said he did not rule out the possibility that the military might have made mistakes in the rescue attempts. </p> <p> The Russian-appointed leader of Chechnya gestured toward the crowd that had gathered to wish him a happy 49th birthday at his heavily guarded home in this Chechen town.  Some, he noted dryly, could well be rebel agents. </p> <p> ''They are everywhere and nowhere,'' Akhmad Kadyrov said with a shrug. ''Some of them might even be among these people.'' </p> <p> Russian law enforcement officials said today they had detained a number of suspects in their investigation into the terrorist bombing of an underground pedestrian walkway that killed 7 and wounded 97 on Tuesday evening. But they said that so far none could be directly linked to the bombing in the heart of the Russian capital. </p> <p> In an unusual rebuke to Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov of Moscow, who was quick to attribute the bombing to Chechens fighting for independence from Russia, President Vladimir V. Putin said today that ''it would be wrong'' to ''brand a whole people'' in the absence of proof of who was behind the bombing. The police and prosecutors also said they had no evidence of Chechen involvement. </p> <p> In the latest twist to years of artistic and administrative turmoil, Vladimir Vasilyev was dismissed as director of the Bolshoi Theater, Russia's premier opera and ballet company, in a decree signed on Monday by President Vladimir Putin. </p> <p> Mr. Vasilyev and a deputy, Vladimir Kokonin, were removed and their posts eliminated. The theater will now be run by a general director and an artistic director, who have not been officially named. Mr. Vasilyev was not informed in advance but heard about the decision on the radio. </p> <p> A bomb exploded in a pedestrian underpass at Pushkin Square in the center of Moscow at the height of rush hour this evening, killing 8 people, wounding 11 and sending dozens more fleeing smoke and flames that scorched the large underground plaza. </p> <p> Mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov tonight described the explosion, which took place a year after rebel leaders in Chechnya began their latest uprising, as a ''terrorist act'' with a ''Chechen trace.'' </p> <p> The government's recent campaign to intimidate some of this nation's most powerful business leaders is meant at least in part to show them that President Vladimir V. Putin is firmly in control. But beneath the surface, executives say, it is business as usual in Russia. </p> <p> The intimidation campaign has included spectacular raids by masked federal agents on offices, surprise lawsuits asserting fraud and tax evasion, and public reprimands of the so-called oligarchs who have amassed enormous amounts of property and political influence since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Such moves were all but unheard of under Mr. Putin's predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin. </p> <p> The Russian submarine disaster in the Barents Sea has been more than a human tragedy. It has also been a test of the true character of President Vladimir Putin and his senior military. Judging just by their arrogant public handling of the crisis in its first days, he and his commanders have again confirmed the worst. </p> <p> As the news first unfolded, the commanders issued conflicting accounts of the sinking of the Kursk submarine, and for days Mr. Putin issued no statement at all. Although we still don't know the details of what caused the disaster, we do know enough about the context to speculate about the larger implications. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin promised the grieving families of the 118-member crew of the destroyed nuclear submarine Kursk tonight that the government would pay each family the equivalent of an officer's salary for 10 years to compensate them for their loss, Russian state television reported. </p> <p> In what appeared to be a closely controlled video account of Mr. Putin's first journey to the northern submarine base from which the twin-reactor submarine made its final voyage two weeks ago, Mr. Putin also met with Irina Lyachin, the widow of the Kursk's skipper, Capt. Gennadi Lyachin, his daughter, Dasha, and unidentified relatives in the captain's apartment in Vidyayevo. No audio account of the conversations was broadcast, and Mrs. Lyachin sat upright and attentive on a couch with her daughter at her side as Mr. Putin was shown speaking to her. </p> <p> As Russia grieved for 118 seamen lost in the remains of the submarine Kursk, President Vladimir V. Putin moved decisively to contain the incident's political impact, going on national television tonight to take responsibility for what some Russians call a badly botched response. </p> <p> In an abruptly scheduled half-hour interview on the state-controlled television network RTR, Mr. Putin said a family member of a submarine crewman had told him that the sinking was his cross to bear as president, and that ''this person was right.'' </p> <p> As onlookers applauded from the gallery, the Supreme Court today rebuffed a final government plea to reopen a treason case against Aleksandr Nikitin, the former navy captain who gave nuclear opponents details of radioactive pollution by Russian submarines. </p> <p> The decision ended -- for good, apparently -- the government's five-year prosecution of Mr. Nikitin, a pursuit that had become an international human rights and environmental issue. </p> <p> These are excerpts from speeches of world leaders yesterday at the United Nations, drawn from official transcripts: </p> <p> 'There can be change. There can be hope for Africa.'  TONY BLAIR  Prime Minister, Britain </p> <p> There is a dismal record of failure in Africa on the part of the developed world that shocks and shames our civilization. Twenty-one of the 44 countries in sub-Saharan Africa are affected by conflict which undermines efforts at development. Even worse, 10 times as many people died of AIDS in Africa last year as were killed in all continent's wars combined. </p> <p> Protected by hundreds of policemen who all but sealed off a Moscow neighborhood, President Vladimir V. Putin visited the site of a bombed-out synagogue tonight to dedicate a $12 million Jewish community center -- a stone-and-glass demonstration, he said, of a new era of tolerance in Russia. </p> <p> It was a strong symbolic gesture of support by a Russian leader for a faith that suffered decades of persecution during Soviet times. But it also placed Mr. Putin once more in the middle of a bitter feud within Russia's reviving Jewish minority  -- and raised questions among critics about his motives. </p> <p> The United States has been pressing Russia not to proceed with plans to sell Iran laser technology that Washington says can be used to make fuel for nuclear weapons, according to Administration officials. </p> <p> Officials said that since July President Clinton has raised the prospective sale of laser technology at least two times in meetings with President Vladimir V. Putin. The most recent occurred this month at the United Nations summit meeting. </p> <p> With the loss of the nuclear submarine Kursk and its 118-member crew, President Vladimir V. Putin has begun consultations with other leaders on an international agreement in which nations that operate warships under the sea would come to one another's aid during disasters. </p> <p> The proposals, drafted by a commission investigating the causes of the Kursk's sinking in the Barents Sea on Aug. 12, were discussed by Mr. Putin during this week's meeting of world leaders at the United Nations. Mr. Putin confirmed in a meeting with news media executives on Wednesday that he had carried the proposals to New York for discussion with other leaders, but the Russian plan has not been elaborated on in public. </p> <p> Facing opposition from his military commanders, President Vladimir V. Putin postponed plans today to cut the armed forces by a third and said ''there will be no wholesale, massive reductions of the Russian armed forces.'' </p> <p> Mr. Putin sounded a note of frustration at a meeting of his National Security Council with top military commanders present, saying, ''We spend colossal resources on the military, and we allow the military budget to be wasted on peripheral issues that have nothing in common with either the army's combat readiness nor with its direct supplies.'' </p> <p> Late last month, President Vladimir V. Putin faced a room full of angry Russians, the relatives of the 118 men who perished on the nuclear submarine Kursk. He told them bluntly that Russia ''had to have a smaller army,'' one that was better equipped and ''technically perfect'' to protect soldiers and sailors from disaster and defend national interests. </p> <p> On Friday, Defense Minister Marshal Igor D. Sergeyev appeared to promise just such a force. While visiting a tank test range outside Moscow, he was asked by reporters to comment on a report that the armed forces would be reduced by 350,000 between 2001 and 2003, a cut of about one-third, from 1.2 million members to about 850,000. </p> <p> Vladimir V. Gusinsky, the Russian media tycoon whose brief arrest in June on corruption charges put a harsh spotlight on the Russian government's blunt use of its powers against media critics, came to New York last week and urged journalists and politicians not to let the spotlight go out. </p> <p> If his quick tour sometimes seemed at cross-purposes with itself -- Mr. Gusinsky wanted to raise the visibility of his cause but insisted that conversations be off the record -- he still made his case to everyone from President Clinton to Mike Wallace of CBS, from senators and congressmen to Lou Boccardi, the president of The Associated Press, and to editors of The Wall Street Journal. </p> <p> In a country  where there are but two sports  soccer, and everything else -- Russians were positively glowing with pride today over the athletic prowess of 20-year-old Marat Safin. </p> <p> This, even though he practices a third-tier sport, tennis, in which the only physical contact is between a racquet and a ball. And even though he is an ethnic Tatar, a people often derided here -- a millennium after the fact, to boot -- as Attila the Hun's henchmen. And even though he and his family left Russia four years ago to live and play tennis in the sunnier climes of Valencia, Spain. </p> <p> Vladimir Putin, playing the weakest of hands, stopped the U.S. from beginning to build a defense against missiles from rogue nations and terrorists. </p> <p> President Clinton and Al Gore, holding all the high cards, folded and let the Russian obstruct a vital element of American defense of our major cities. </p> <p> Russia's most flamboyant tycoon aggravated a standoff with President Vladimir V. Putin late today by announcing, as promised, that he is giving away his dominant stake in the nation's largest television network rather than surrender it to Kremlin control. </p> <p> Or almost, anyway. The tycoon, Boris Berezovsky, said at a news conference that he was putting his shares in the network, ORT, in trust for the next four years, splitting control among a host of national journalistic and cultural figures. If their stewardship is successful, he said, he will give them a 20 percent stake. </p> <p> With President Clinton and other government leaders filling seats usually occupied by their envoys, the Security Council moved today toward a new role for itself in a world where the rules have been rewritten by warlords, and the poor kill the poor over dwindling resources. </p> <p> The unusual meeting, with 14 heads of government and a foreign minister gathered around the Council table, was intended to concentrate on peacekeeping problems, with a special emphasis on Africa. </p> <p> One of the country's media moguls, Boris Berezovsky, said today that a senior Kremlin official had ordered him to transfer his holdings in Russia's primary state-owned television channel to the state or face the prospect of going to jail. </p> <p> Mr. Berezovsky made this assertion in a letter addressed to President Vladimir V. Putin that was made available to news organizations today. </p> <p> The sinking of the Russian submarine Kursk was a tragic but incredibly illuminating example of the transition the world, and Russia, are now going through from the cold-war system to the globalization system. Unfortunately, there's always some guy down the line who hasn't gotten the word yet. In this case it was Russia's president, Vladimir Putin. </p> <p> Yo, Putin, this ain't your father's Soviet Union anymore. </p> <p> President Clinton called Yasir Arafat today to urge him to bring rioting in the West Bank and Gaza under control quickly. But Mr. Clinton received no assurances and no response to an invitation for Mr. Arafat to travel to Washington soon to map a way back to peace talks, administration officials said tonight. </p> <p> Mr. Clinton planned to speak with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel promptly, the officials said, with a similar call for restraint and an invitation to a separate meeting with the president. But officials said the two leaders had not been able to speak. </p> <p> After a decade of stumbling through false starts and failures, Russia seems to be making progress in its hoped-for transition to a market economy. Now a 36-year-old colleague of President Vladimir V. Putin is getting his turn to steer. </p> <p> German O. Gref, Mr. Putin's economic development minister since the new administration was elected in March, is under orders to cut taxes, simplify the bureaucracy, and revamp courts and monopolies in hopes of sustaining growth and restoring the faith of skeptical investors. </p> <p> Vladimir Putin, president of Russia, looked down the gorgeous hall in the Kremlin of which he was now master. Seated before him, on a muggy summer day, were some 30 men who represented the better part of Russia's capitalist class. They were known as oligarchs, from the Greek-derived ''oligarchy,'' meaning rule of the few. In the Yeltsin era of the 1990's, so much power passed into their hands that the word had fit them like a glove. Putin -- a diminutive man who had made lieutenant colonel in the K.G.B. -- was here to tell them that their rule was over. </p> <p> ''You built this state yourselves, to a great degree,'' he began, ''through the political or semipolitical structures under your control, so there is no point in blaming the reflection in the mirror.'' The attack was the verbal equivalent of deashibari -- a judo move designed to throw the opponent instantly -- which Putin has said is his favorite gambit. They were, in truth, already off balance. The oligarchic period had made them all very rich. But for most of them, it was an unstable, robber-baron kind of wealth that could be snatched away at any time. Not far from the gilded hall, they knew, Putin was keeping kompromat on them, material gathered by the security agencies on their rise to wealth -- piles that were, a Putin adviser said, ''meters high.'' </p> <p> As Serbia's opposition vowed to shut the country down on Monday, several hundred policemen, apparently sent to try to keep electricity production going, tonight surrounded and entered an important coal mine that went on strike on Friday. </p> <p> The strike is part of the opposition's campaign to force President Slobodan Milosevic to concede defeat in the Sept. 24 elections to the challenger, Vojislav Kostunica. The coal mine supplies an electrical power station at Obrenovac, which produces up to half of Serbia's electricity in a system patched together after NATO bombing campaign last year. At least 4,500 coal workers are on strike, and the general manager of part of the mine, Slobodan Jankovic, resigned earlier today, throwing his support to the workers. </p> <p> Striking a cautious tone, President Vladimir V. Putin has refused to take a position on the leadership struggle in Yugoslavia. </p> <p> He took no step toward recognizing the Sept. 24 election victory of the opposition leader, Vojislav Kostunica, a step that the United States and European governments were hoping he would take. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia today took a high-profile tour of India's leading nuclear research center, where reactors and bombs are designed, and promised to work with India in developing peaceful uses for atomic energy while encouraging India to sign the nuclear nonproliferation and test ban treaties. </p> <p> Mr. Putin's hour-and-a-half visit to the Bhabha Atomic Research Center in Bombay was the last stop on his four-day trip to India. It suggested how far India has come in regaining international acceptance since it conducted nuclear tests in May 1998. </p> <p> It is probably unfair to read much into the fact that on the last day of the three-day visit here of Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, President Jacques Chirac changed his schedule to fly to Cherbourg and visit the spot where a chemical tanker had just sunk in the English Channel. </p> <p> But there is no question that the leaky tanker was making a lot more headlines than the president of Russia. That was in part owing to the relatively low-key nature of Mr. Putin's first visit to France, a country he had snubbed since taking office because it was so vocal in denouncing Russia's war in Chechnya. </p> <p> Unwilling to wait for a declared winner in the American presidential race, the Kremlin has mounted a diplomatic offensive to advertise its desire to make deep cuts in the nuclear arsenals of Russia and the United States as soon as possible after a new president takes office. </p> <p> With a statement directed at Washington by President Vladimir V. Putin on Monday, followed by presentations today by a senior military commander and a top foreign ministry official, the Russian leadership chose this week of electoral chaos in the United States to make its case. </p> <p> The Kremlin said tonight that it plans to shrink its three-million-strong armed forces by 600,000 people, led by deep cuts in the main Defense Ministry forces, to rein in what President Vladimir V. Putin called an unwieldy and extravagant military machine. </p> <p> The move may also presage a deeper reshuffling of the defense apparatus and more direct control of the military by Mr. Putin. But some were unsure that the cuts would produce the sweeping reform Mr. Putin and his aides said they were committed to achieving. </p> <p> For almost 15 years, it has seemed to Russians and the world that what went up might, happily, never come down. Alas, it appears not to be. Today the Kremlin gave its first blessing to a proposal to crash the Mir space station into the Pacific Ocean in February. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin's cabinet issued the go-ahead after a briefing by the general director of the Russian Space Agency, Yuri N. Koptev, who later said that the 130-ton ship was corroding and leaking and that major components could fail at any time. </p> <p> Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Yasir Arafat spoke by telephone today and agreed to maintain field-level security links that Israel had threatened to sever a day earlier. </p> <p> Mr. Arafat promised that he would ''do everything he could to put an end to violence,'' according to the official Israeli account of the unexpected conversation, which was engineered by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. </p> <p> The Russian media mogul Vladimir V. Gusinsky, a fierce critic of his government and deeply in debt, tentatively agreed today to give up control of his publishing and broadcasting empire to the country's natural gas monopoly, which is controlled by the Russian government. </p> <p> The agreement, which is subject to court review, raises questions about the level of independence Mr. Gusinsky's company will retain after the gas company becomes its largest single shareholder with a 46 percent stake. Mr. Gusinsky's company, Media-Most, owns the nation's leading independent television station -- NTV -- and his news programs and publications have been critical of Kremlin policies. </p> <p> Only a month ago, Fidel Castro was characterizing Russia as just another cash-strapped third world country, whose former president, Boris N. Yeltsin, had sold out the socialist vision by breaking up the Soviet Union in 1991, supposedly over a bottle of vodka, with the leaders of Ukraine and Belarus. </p> <p> But when President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia arrived this week on a state visit to revive the ties between Moscow and Havana -- and to try to clear the backlog of $20 billion Cuba owes to its former patron -- President Castro summoned brass bands to trumpet the ''reconfirmation of friendship,'' as the Communist Party newspaper put it Friday. The news about the debt was buried. </p> <p> Russia's Parliament voted 381 to 51 today to restore the Soviet national anthem as the state hymn -- its words to be rewritten -- and to bring back the Soviet red banner -- without the hammer and sickle -- as the official flag of the armed forces. </p> <p> The legislation, submitted earlier this week by President Vladimir V. Putin and intended to set state symbols into law as provided by the Russian Constitution, retains the 300-year-old Russian tricolor of white, blue and red as the state flag, and the czarist era double-headed eagle as the national seal. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said today that he would accept the recommendation of his presidential pardon commission to set free Edmond Pope, the former naval intelligence officer sentenced to 20 years for alleged espionage this week. </p> <p> His release is expected as early as Thursday. </p> <p> A Moscow judge today handed down the maximum sentence of 20 years at hard labor against a former American naval intelligence officer, Edmond Pope, after a seven-week espionage trial behind closed doors. </p> <p> The 54-year-old businessman was accused last April of obtaining secret plans and technical reports for Russia's rocket-propelled Shkval -- or Squall in English -- torpedo, which travels at 230 miles an hour. </p> <p> Fresh from a visit to Cuba, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia visited Canada today and lined up its support for strengthening a cold war treaty that the Russians see as blocking an American national missile defense system. </p> <p> ''Canada and the Russian Federation agree that the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty is a cornerstone of strategic stability,'' read the joint communique signed by Mr. Putin and by Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada. In a diplomatic offensive directed at American allies this year, the Russians have argued that the treaty rules out the kind of missile defense system advocated by President-elect George W. Bush. </p> <p> Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq was in town doing some lobbying on behalf of President Saddam Hussein last month, and while he was here, he took the opportunity to say on national television what several former Soviet client states may have been wanting to say for a long time. </p> <p> ''For the last 10 years, some people have held jobs in the Russian government without knowing the country's history of relations'' with its Soviet-era friends, Mr. Aziz said. ''Many of them viewed the West as the sole way to resolve Russia's problems.'' </p> <p> The low point came last summer when President Vladimir V. Putin witnessed Russia's Olympic gold medalists standing in awkward silence on the victory stands of Sydney as their national anthem rumbled out of the loudspeakers. </p> <p> If, to some, they appeared at a loss for words, it was for good reason. The Russian state hymn has no words. </p> <p> President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine is having one of the worst ordeals of his long political career. </p> <p> First, he is facing the monumental task on Dec. 15 of closing the last reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, site of the 1986 fire and radiation catastrophe. But the shutdown threatens further power cuts for millions of Ukrainians already shivering because of storms and equipment breakdowns. </p> <p> Edmond Pope, an American businessman and retired naval intelligence officer who had been convicted of espionage by a Russian court and sentenced to 20 years in prison, was pardoned today by President Vladimir V. Putin and was immediately flown out of Russia. </p> <p> Mr. Putin said in his decree that he had granted the pardon because of Mr. Pope's health problems and because he wanted to preserve good relations with the United States. </p> <p> Russia and Cuba, two battered allies who fell out a decade ago when the Soviet Union fell apart, officially got back together today when President Vladimir V. Putin and President Fidel Castro pledged to reinvent the relationship based on a modest agenda of trade and commerce and an equally modest smattering of ideological alignment. </p> <p> The Russian leader wore a business suit -- he is here mostly to talk business about the billions of dollars in Soviet-era investments in Cuba that have come to naught, and for which debts are owed. </p> <p> A prominent Russian government official, accused of taking millions of dollars in kickbacks from Swiss companies, appeared yesterday in federal court in Brooklyn on a Swiss arrest warrant. He had been picked up at Kennedy International Airport on Wednesday on his way to the inauguration of George W. Bush. </p> <p> The official, Pavel P. Borodin, is a close associate of both President Vladimir V. Putin and former President Boris Yeltsin. In Moscow, the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, summoned Ambassador James Collins of the United States to demand that Mr. Borodin be freed. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin today described as ''rubbish'' American intelligence reports that the Russian military had moved tactical nuclear weapons into a storage depot that serves the Baltic Fleet in Kaliningrad. </p> <p> Taking a walk around Red Square this evening with the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, Mr. Putin was asked about the reports, which were emanating this week from Washington, and, speaking in German, he responded, ''That's rubbish.'' </p> <p> How Europe reacts to George W. Bush's plans for a national missile defense shield and whether Russia defaults on its Soviet-era debt were the main questions taken up here today as President Vladimir V. Putin held his first summit meeting of the new year with the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder. </p> <p> The two leaders were also expected to touch on issues relating to NATO's eastward expansion, the instability in Kosovo and perhaps even German restitution for cultural treasures looted by the Nazis. But they are likely to dwell on Russia's debt and the security policies of the incoming Bush administration. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin sent a letter to President Bush this week proposing broader Russian-American cooperation and setting out the major issues on which he believes the two countries can cooperate, the Kremlin's news service said today. </p> <p> Mr. Putin sent the letter on Tuesday, along with a second note to former President Bill Clinton expressing gratitude for his ''constructive and well-meaning approach'' to Russian-American relations, a Kremlin spokesman said. </p> <p> Aside from his wife, Edmond D. Pope probably had no greater advocate proclaiming his innocence on charges of spying in Russia than Representative John E. Peterson. </p> <p> In a telephone conversation, Mr. Pope described the congressman as ''one of the two heroes'' in winning his release in December after he was convicted of espionage. The other was his wife, Cheri. </p> <p> A blizzard was blowing across Red Square one day last week, and the wet snow was turning hairdos into spaghetti curls while putting a white veneer on the mountains of dirty snow that line the streets of the capital this time of year. Nonetheless, Vladimir Barinov and his wife and son persevered against the weather, along with about 1,000 other people, and lined up to see the preserved body of Lenin. </p> <p> The family was visiting from Vladivostok, nine time zones to the east.  Because Mr. Barinov, a 50-year-old railway worker, had never looked upon the face that launched the Bolshevik revolution, he said, and because his 13-year-old son, Peter, soon to enter high school, had never encountered Lenin or Leninism in the new Russian school system, ''I thought we would just stop by and see him.'' </p> <p> Treading into national security policy after a week devoted to education, abortion and tax cuts, President Bush said today that he intended to keep his campaign pledge to reduce the nation's nuclear weapons as he moved ahead with construction of a defense against ballistic missiles. </p> <p> Mr. Bush repeated a proposal he made last spring and suggested he would proceed with reductions in nuclear warheads and the construction of a missile defense as a way to spur new arms-control negotiations with the Russians . </p> <p> His defenders insist otherwise, and they may yet be right. But there are growing signs that the battle to control Vladimir Gusinsky's Media-Most press empire -- and by extension, the last nationwide voice critical of President Vladimir V. Putin -- is near endgame, and that Mr. Putin's allies smell victory. </p> <p> Media-Most's largest creditor, the state-controlled Gazprom natural-gas monopoly, formally said today that it planned to appoint its own board of directors for the company after a Moscow court decision on Thursday that, Gazprom said, gives it control of Media-Most. </p> <p> Talks between Russia's largest independent television network and its main creditor deteriorated further today after the creditor pulled out of an agreement with an international investment bank to sell a stake in the network. </p> <p> The dispute, which for months has pitted the Russian media entrepreneur Vladimir Gusinsky against the government, flared up this week after each side accused the other of violating a crucial contract signed last year. Though negotiations have not broken down entirely, the problems have cast a shadow over talks with foreign investors, including Ted Turner, on the purchase of a stake in the television network, NTV. Mr. Gusinsky founded NTV, which is part owned by his company, Media-Most. Gazprom, the government-controlled gas company, is NTV's largest shareholder. </p> <p> It was on the last day of Passover 51 years ago that the K.G.B. seized Yitzakh Kogan's grandfather for the high crime of baking kosher matzo. </p> <p> ''It was impossible to bake matzo in Leningrad,'' the grandson said. ''It was the law of city. And he had made it for all the Jews. </p> <p> The German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, left Moscow tonight like a smiling creditor who got what he wanted from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who saw off his guest with an affirmative airport declaration: ''We intend to pay and will pay the debts of the former Soviet Union.'' About $20 billion of the $48 billion in Soviet-era debt is held by Germany. </p> <p> After a festive weekend of negotiation, religious services celebrating the Eastern Orthodox Christmas, motor touring and even sleigh riding through the snowy Russian countryside, the two leaders, and their wives, Doris and Lyudmila, parted company today in high spirits. But neither indicated that a solution had been found to Russia's imminent default on $1.5 billion in debt payments due in the first quarter of the year. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin effectively downgraded Russia's war in Chechnya today from a military to a counterterrorist operation, saying he planned to cut Russia's 80,000-member force in the rebellious province by nearly three-quarters in coming months. </p> <p> That plan, combined with an order turning over control of Chechen operations to his domestic intelligence agency, the Federal Security Service, suggests that the Kremlin considers its war against the separatist rebels largely won. </p> <p> Less than a week before he meets President Bush in Washington, the president of South Korea today publicly took Russia's side in the debate over Washington's plan for a national missile defense. </p> <p> A joint communiqué issued by President Kim Dae Jung with the visiting president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin, declared that the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which would be threatened by Washington's project, was a ''cornerstone of strategic stability.'' The treaty should be preserved and strengthened, the communiqué said. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin and Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, discussed the proposed American missile defense at a Kremlin meeting today, ending two days of talks that Mr. Fischer said pointed to new Russian flexibility on the notion of a shield against rogue missiles. </p> <p> Mr. Fischer and Russian officials denied that Germany was acting as an intermediary between Moscow and the new Bush administration, which has made clear its plan to develop the shield in the face of European qualms and fierce Russian opposition. </p> <p> The presidents of Russia and Ukraine signed agreements today to expand their cooperation in civilian space research and aviation, in a meeting that reaffirmed the political and industrial ties between the two former Soviet republics. </p> <p> Though the talks were long planned, the moment was meaningful for both men, Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Leonid D. Kuchma of Ukraine. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin won first-round passage today for a bill to finance and regulate political parties. </p> <p> As with almost everything Mr. Putin does, the debate in the Parliament today, where the measure passed by 280 votes to 109, centered on whether the president was really trying to expand democratic pluralism or restrict it. </p> <p> A bitter wind grasping at his pants legs, Nikolai A. Yudin raised one arm outside the boiler room at the O.A.O. Razdolnoye Building Materials Factory, a red-brick husk aged well beyond its 42 years, and pointed emphatically at -- nothing. </p> <p> ''There is supposed to be 6,000 tons of coal here,'' he said, staring contemptuously into a broad, shallow pit beside a rail spur, barren but for a thick coat of snow. ''We need 6,000. We got 123.'' </p> <p> In what appears to be the longest and most substantive of his conversations with foreign leaders, President Bush initiated a 15-minute telephone call to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia today. Mr. Putin raised the case of a former Kremlin aide now under arrest in New York on charges of money laundering, Russian officials said. </p> <p> White House officials said little about the telephone call -- less, in fact, than the Russians did -- and would not say whether the two men had talked about Mr. Bush's hopes of building a national missile defense. Mr. Putin has been leading an international campaign to persuade other nations to oppose the program. </p> <p> Two days after American officials told their European counterparts that the United States intended to go ahead and develop a national missile shield -- but only after extensive consultations -- Russia responded today with a sober warning that it is ready to resort to a new arms race to ensure that its strategic rocket forces will not be undermined. </p> <p> At the same time, President Vladimir V. Putin was said to be preparing a diplomatic offensive to meet the leaders of two of the so-called rogue nations whose ballistic missiles are of greatest concern to Washington. </p> <p> Reviving a practice hated, feared and ultimately banned in Soviet times, the domestic successor to the K.G.B. has served notice that it is again investigating anonymous accusations of crimes against Russian citizens. </p> <p> The K.G.B. heir, the Federal Security Service, published its decision nearly two weeks ago virtually as a footnote in the government's daily newspaper of record, Rossiyskaya Gazeta. Not until this week did it attract the attention of human rights advocates and liberal politicians, who argue not just that the practice is a step back toward a Soviet-style police state, but that it is also illegal. </p> <p> The offer last week from Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, to work with NATO on a mobile land-based missile defense system creates an important opportunity for the United States to engage Russia in a cooperative effort to develop a missile shield. In his meeting last weekend with Igor Ivanov, Russia's foreign minister, Secretary of State Colin Powell agreed to open a dialogue on this issue. </p> <p> A joint program of Russia and NATO to defend against possible missile attacks from countries like North Korea, Iran and Iraq would address Europe's two main worries about the Bush administration's commitment to building an antimissile system: that it could trigger a new cold war with Russia and that it would signify an American search for unilateral advantage. </p> <p> A group of 100 people arrived here from North Korea this afternoon for the third round of visits for long-lost relatives, and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia arrived for a two-day visit, with inter-Korean relations high on the agenda. </p> <p> For President Kim Dae Jung, preparing to receive Mr. Putin on Tuesday, the events dramatized his policy of ''sunshine'' vis-à-vis North Korea. </p> <p> Breaking openly with both the United States and his predecessor Boris N. Yeltsin, President Vladimir V. Putin formally agreed today to resume sales of conventional arms to Iran after a hiatus of more than five years. </p> <p> At a meeting in the Kremlin with President Muhammad Khatami of Iran, Mr. Putin also reiterated Russia's intention to help Iran complete a long-stalled nuclear power plant that some American experts contend could advance Iran's nuclear weapons program. </p> <p> Last year President Vladimir V. Putin flew in a jet fighter to Chechnya and sailed in a nuclear submarine in an Arctic sea. Tonight he entered cyberspace for the first time. </p> <p> Greeting a mostly young audience from around the world in a 40-minute live encounter on the Internet that was broadcast by the BBC, Mr. Putin defended Russia's policies in Chechnya, praised the achievements of the Soviet education system, and insisted that he was taking the country in the right direction toward greater democracy. </p> <p> After paying his respects to the embalmed body of Ho Chi Minh, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia left for home today showing some satisfaction that he had re-established Russia as a player in Asia. </p> <p> With his visits to South Korea and to this citadel of solidarity with Russia's Soviet past, Mr. Putin settled important economic issues of Soviet-era debt, advanced Russian energy and transport projects that could reap significant benefits for Moscow over the next decade, and showed that he is able to play a constructive -- perhaps crucial -- role in defusing the region's most urgent security threat, the North Korean ballistic missile program. </p> <p> Newspaper readers and television viewers over the past few days might have been forgiven for thinking they were caught in a time warp, a throwback to the bad old days of Dr. Strangelove and superpower  conflict. The expulsion of 50 Russian diplomats from the United States and Russia's quick retaliation in kind feel  like something out of the cold war. But despite all the rhetoric, these actions, at least for the intelligence agencies on both sides, do not signal a return to the cold war. For them, it never ended. </p> <p> Nothing on the grand scale of the current expulsions has been seen since 1986, when a round of retaliations began in August with the espionage arrest in New York of a Soviet intelligence agent employed at the United Nations. A week later, Nicholas Daniloff, an American correspondent for U.S. News & World Report, was arrested in Moscow. Over the next two months of tit for tat, 25 Soviet diplomats were expelled from the United States, Moscow ejected five Americans, and then Washington banished 55 more Soviets. </p> <p> Saudi Arabian police officers forced their way into a hijacked Russian jetliner today, freeing more than 100 passengers and shooting dead one hijacker after he fatally knifed a flight attendant, Saudi and Russian officials said. </p> <p> An unidentified Turkish passenger was also reported killed in the morning raid after a night of fruitless negotiations between Saudi officials and the hijackers. A Russian plane left Moscow tonight to pick up the Russians freed by Saudi security forces. </p> <p> As the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, flew off to Vietnam today, South Koreans were left wondering why their government, one of America's staunchest allies in the region, had tilted toward Russia on a crucial issue of international security during his visit here this week. The answer, officials here said, seems to be the fear of another crisis over North Korea's ballistic missile program and Russia's increasingly important role in trying to persuade North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, to give it up. </p> <p> Suddenly, the South Korean president, Kim Dae Jung, needs Mr. Putin. And time is running out as domestic frustration with the North-South peace initiative is rising in South Korea while, in Washington, the Bush administration is already showing signs of impatience and a hardening of tone over North Korea's lack of movement. </p> <p> When President Vladimir Putin of Russia announced his interest in joining the United States and Europe in a missile-defense program, it appeared that old adversaries might be coming together. But one significant adversary, China, would be left out. China is terrified of a missile-defense system that would make its own nuclear force impotent. The inclusion of Russia, at least from China's point of view, would only further endanger global security. </p> <p> Russia has not really been the problem since the Reagan administration. Indeed, President George H. W. Bush briefly pursued a joint Russian-American anti-ballistic missile system. It had been proposed by Boris Yeltsin in response to Mr. Bush's advocacy of missile defense -- a situation rather similar to that today. Then as now, none of the American missile defense systems being considered could reduce the deterrent of Russia's several thousand warheads. The only major power threatened by the new round of missile defense proposals is China. And the chief effect of Russia's offer of cooperation would be to radically destabilize global security dynamics by backing China into a corner. </p> <p> The Bush administration has not articulated a broad policy toward Russia, but in thoughts and deeds it has taken a sharp departure from the engagement policies of its predecessor, moving toward isolating Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin. </p> <p> In its first two months, despite a lack of crises before this week's tit-for-tat spy expulsions, the administration has shown apparent disdain for Russia by insisting that it will move ahead on missile defense regardless of Moscow's objections, by rebuffing the suggestion of a summit meeting and showing an inclination to downgrade the status of Russia as a world power. </p> <p> Russia said today that it was expelling four United States diplomats for ''activities incompatible with their status,'' the diplomatic phrase for espionage, and added that it would take ''other measures to halt the unlawful activities'' of official American representatives, but did not elaborate. </p> <p> In a formal statement read to John Ordway, the second-ranking American diplomat in Moscow, a Foreign Ministry official did not identify the diplomats to be expelled in the next few days and did not state that Russia would fully retaliate for the Bush administration's decision to expel a total of 50 Russian diplomats between now and July. </p> <p> The European Union said today that it had pressed Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, to find a ''political solution'' in Chechnya, but Mr. Putin defended his handling of the situation, saying he saw parallels with the problems developing in Macedonia. </p> <p> At lunch with European leaders who are here for a two-day meeting, Mr. Putin played down a tit-for-tat espionage dispute with Washington, saying he doubted that it marked a serious breakdown in relations. </p> <p> The Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, today made his first visit to the capital of this old Soviet ally, which is fitfully trying to open its economy and catch up with the development boom in Asia. </p> <p> From the Russian perspective, Mr. Putin had a good first day here on a tour that started in South Korea, though his motorcades through the bicycle-clogged streets attracted far less interest than did President Clinton's in November, which turned out large, enthusiastic crowds. </p> <p> The government made a swift retreat today from what had appeared to be a decision by President Kim Dae Jung to support President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in opposing the missile defense program backed by President George W. Bush. </p> <p> Pressed by United States officials for an explanation of Mr. Kim and Mr. Putin's joint statement on Tuesday, the Foreign Ministry drew a careful distinction between endorsement of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 and opposition to national missile defense. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin replaced his defense and interior ministers today and dismissed the country's atomic energy chief in the most extensive set of personnel changes in his year-old government. </p> <p> In a statement from the Kremlin, Mr. Putin said ''the time has come'' to put in place a team that will execute plans debated for nearly two years to reconcile Russia's drastically reduced defense resources with its ambitions to be a more effective military power -- and salesman of nuclear energy. </p> <p> Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and the Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, decided today to turn the page from last month's tit-for-tat spy expulsions and agreed during a session in Paris that their leaders would have their first meeting by the end of July. </p> <p> At a news conference in Paris before General Powell flew to Macedonia for Balkan talks, he and Mr. Ivanov outlined several fronts on which they hoped to work together. </p> <p> Spain today rejected Russia's request to extradite Vladimir A. Gusinsky, ending the media baron's 10-month legal battle with the Russian authorities just as the prize pieces of his Russian empire were being seized. </p> <p> Spain's high court decided, 2 to 1, against handing over Mr. Gusinsky, who is charged with fraud in Russia, saying in a 30-page document that the charges are not a crime in Spain. Mr. Gusinsky will be free to travel within three days if the decision is not appealed. He has been confined by house arrest to his home since December. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia today ordered his government to make the entrenched management of Gazprom, the world's largest natural gas company, more open and accountable to its shareholders. </p> <p> In a meeting of cabinet ministers, Mr. Putin told officials to take steps to ''increase transparency and efficiency'' in Gazprom, which is Russia's biggest company by far and is responsible for an estimated 7 percent of the country's economic output. Mr. Putin installed a close aide as chairman of the board last year, but since then has refrained from using that new influence to push for changes in Gazprom. </p> <p> Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany delivered a strong message to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia here today, saying that Europe is concerned about Russian press freedom. </p> <p> Mr. Putin, in response, pledged that he would do ''everything to guarantee freedom of speech.'' But he added that he would not interfere in the legal battle for control of the country's largest independent television network, NTV, though he would support the property rights of the station's creditors -- allies of the Kremlin -- to put the network under new management. </p> <p> A Russian official detained in New York since January on Swiss charges of laundering millions of dollars in kickbacks from Swiss companies that renovated the Kremlin agreed yesterday to abandon his fight against extradition, saying he wanted to go to trial in Geneva and clear his name. </p> <p> The official, Pavel P. Borodin, 54, a close associate of President Vladimir V. Putin and of former President Boris N. Yeltsin, was once director of the Kremlin's property department. He made his wishes known in a brief hearing before Magistrate Judge Viktor V. Pohorelsky in federal court in Brooklyn. </p> <p> After making major changes in his cabinet last week, President Vladimir V. Putin promised a governmentwide shake-up today aimed at making business work, reversing capital flight and sustaining economic growth. </p> <p> Officials have been hinting for weeks that Mr. Putin would use his state of the union address to lay the groundwork for a significant round of reform, most prominently to rebuild the Soviet-era court system, but also to overcome bureaucratic resistance to a system of open and profitable businesses. </p> <p> Foes of the Russian press baron Vladimir A. Gusinsky breached the walls of his media empire at last today, staging a renegade stockholders' meeting at which they appeared to seize control of the prize asset, the nationwide NTV television network. </p> <p> The day's events touched off an extraordinary scene this evening on NTV, the only network not under effective state control, as its journalists and supporters mounted a marathon broadcast to protest what they call an ill-disguised takeover by interests of the Kremlin. </p> <p> As the Bush administration continues to review its foreign policy and has turned its attention this week to a crisis with China, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is doing what he can to move into the areas where Washington appears to have disengaged, Russian officials say. </p> <p> The officials say that Mr. Putin is trying to strengthen Moscow's bonds with Europe, increase Russia's role as a mediator in regional conflicts and open new trade links with Asia. </p> <p> In the first weeks of the Bush administration, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell recommended to the president that the current United States ambassador to NATO, Alexander Vershbow, become the next ambassador to Russia, administration officials say. </p> <p> And though Mr. Bush has since sent to the Senate nominations for ambassadorial posts in Britain, France, Japan, Canada, India and the Bahamas -- and today nominated envoys to Malta and Jamaica -- Mr. Vershbow's nomination remains uncertain as he administration continues to debate whether to pursue a harder line with President Vladimir V. Putin. </p> <p> It was still not clear today who controls NTV, the controversial and debt-saddled independent television network that has deftly cast itself as a flickering candle of press freedom in a stiff Russian wind. </p> <p> What was abundantly clear, however, was who was not in control: not the government-dominated monopoly Gazprom, which sprang a hostile takeover on Tuesday. And definitely not the Kremlin, which more than a few people here say is intent on snuffing out NTV. </p> <p> President Bush and his new foreign policy team have announced that they plan to undertake a full review of all aspects of American policy toward Russia on matters like economic assistance, NATO expansion and missile defense. There must be a new agenda, we are told, because the old approach of cooperation and engagement pursued by the Clinton administration has been ineffective. In hinting at the tone of their new policy, Bush administration officials have promised a realist approach, which would presumably include greater attention to Russia's international conduct and less to reforms within Russia. </p> <p> Reviews are necessary and rethinking of policies prudent. But why, before the review is completed, has the administration already announced plans to cut cooperative nonproliferation programs between the United States and Russia? Perhaps, after a thorough reassessment, the Bush team could make the case that the cooperative programs that we now sponsor in Russia and other former Soviet republics do not serve American national security interests. Until such a case can be made, however, the proposal to cut these programs by $100 million, or more than 10 percent, from current financing levels is bad policy and worse as symbolism. True realism on the part of the Bush foreign policy team would mean increasing, not decreasing, the size of these efforts. </p> <p> Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany said here today that he and President Vladimir V. Putin had made little progress on plans to exchange part of Russia's Soviet-era debt for German investment in the Russian economy. </p> <p> But on the final day of a meeting intended to bind Russian interests more closely to Europe, Mr. Schröder said he is willing to play a leading role in arguing Russia's case to Western creditors concerning its foreign debt. Russia is seeking a restructuring by 2003, when annual payments will surge from $14 billion to about $19 billion. </p> <p> Russia said today that it would begin a sweeping overhaul of its electricity industry, one of President Vladimir V. Putin's first major reform efforts, despite critics who warn that the changes would hurt foreign investors. </p> <p> The program, which would gradually create a market for electric power, was given tentative approval in a government meeting today, and would be official within a month. The electricity sector, comprising dozens of companies, would be divided into generation, distribution and sales units. The government would sell stakes in them, but would retain full control over the grid itself, and thousands of miles of power lines. </p> <p> President Bush's pledge today that he will consult with allies as he moves forward with missile defense did not quiet many detractors. They said they feared that the president had already made up his mind to scrap the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, alter the global strategic balance and develop costly and unproven military technology. </p> <p> Backers of the missile system among Congressional Republicans were, as expected, buoyed today by Mr. Bush's words. And judging from the Kremlin's upbeat reaction to Mr. Bush's telephone call today with  President Vladimir V. Putin, he found a number of positive points in Mr. Bush's presentation -- especially the American pledge to engage Moscow in a new strategic dialogue that might lead to Russia rebuilding  its own missile systems. Mr. Putin has been assiduously promoting that idea in Europe. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin is scheduled to decide this week whether to allow Gazprom, the immense natural gas monopoly and Russia's most valuable company, to sink further into decay or to shake it up with new management in hope of a fresh start. </p> <p> The government owns the largest stake in the company, and is to decide in a crucial meeting on Wednesday whether to renew the contract of Gazprom's chief executive, Rem Vyakhirev, who has run the company since 1992, several years after it arose from the rubble of the old Soviet gas ministry. </p> <p> To win Russia's cooperation in scrapping the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, the Bush administration is preparing a broad offer of arms purchases, military aid and joint antimissile exercises, according to senior Administration strategists. </p> <p> Officials said the proposals are likely to include an offer to buy Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missiles that could be integrated into a defensive shield over Russia and Europe. </p> <p> In a move to rid Russia of a major obstacle to his economic overhaul program, President Vladimir V. Putin has engineered the replacement of the head of Gazprom, the huge natural gas monopoly, with a close Putin ally. </p> <p> Gazprom's board voted unanimously today to remove Rem Vyakhirev, 66 the company's chief executive since 1992, and named as his successor Aleksei Miller, a 39-year-old economist, who had worked for five years as a deputy to Mr. Putin. </p> <p> American officials said today that President Bush would probably meet Russia's president, Vladimir N. Putin, during a trip to Europe in June. The session will present their first opportunity to discuss several points of friction between Washington and Moscow, including the administration's missile defense plans, the future of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty and Mr. Bush's oft-stated reluctance to provide additional financial aid to Russia. </p> <p> The encounter is expected to come toward the end of a trip during which Mr. Bush will meet with the leaders of NATO nations and visit Spain, Poland, Sweden and Belgium. A month later, Mr. Bush will meet Mr. Putin again, at the annual meeting of the leaders of the world's major industrial nations in Genoa, Italy. </p> <p> It is not an easy thing to quantify, much less to prove. But among intellectuals and  advocates of a democratic Russia in the Western mode, a gnawing concern is arising that the relative freedom from state surveillance and restriction that citizens have relished in the last decade may be drawing to a close. </p> <p> Supplanting it is a resurgent government obsession with internal security and threats from abroad -- a phenomenon that they say has set off a limited but growing crackdown on supposed challenges to the state. </p> <p> At his press conference in Moscow after he met with President Bush in Slovenia, President Vladimir Putin of Russia indicated his interest in a compromise on amending the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to allow an American missile defense. But he also indicated, forcefully, that this must be a genuine compromise, taking Russian concerns into account, or Russia would retaliate with a major expansion of its nuclear arsenal. This tough stance was inevitable. From the Russian point of view, it is an effort at balance. </p> <p> The American plans carry an obvious long-term threat to Russia's own nuclear deterrent; from the viewpoint of Russian security, adding warheads to counter an American missile shield would be a logical course. More immediately, the plans put Russia in a complex situation -- especially, as President Putin hinted, with regard to China. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin said today that if the United States proceeded on its own to construct a missile defense shield over its territory and that of its allies, Russia would eventually upgrade its strategic nuclear arsenal with multiple warheads -- reversing an achievement of arms control in recent decades -- to ensure that it would be able to overwhelm such a shield. </p> <p> Mr. Putin made his comments in a meeting with American correspondents that lasted nearly three hours tonight and was organized last week to give him an opportunity to explain his views after his summit meeting with President Bush in Slovenia on Saturday. </p> <p> Whatever happens now, for good or for ill, a new era in America's relations with Russia began today. </p> <p> Seldom have two leaders so strikingly overcome the limited expectations about their first meeting as George W. Bush and Vladimir V. Putin did today, putting their new friendship on a high plane of newfound trust and instructing their defense chiefs, both hard-liners, and their foreign secretaries, to find a common approach for a new framework for international security. </p> <p> Following are excerpts from the statements and answers yesterday by President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia after their meeting, as transcribed by the Federal News Service Inc. Mr. Putin's statements were made through an interpreter. </p> <p> President Bush </p> <p> President Putin and I have just concluded two hours of straightforward and productive meetings. We had a good discussion of our views of Russian-American relations and of the changing world at the beginnings of this new century. Our countries have common interests and we share great responsibilities. </p> <p> Russian President Vladimir V. Putin cautioned President Bush today about developing a missile defense shield without Moscow's consent, telling Mr. Bush that such an action could seriously strain relations between the two countries. </p> <p> But that warning was a surprisingly gentle one, tucked into a news conference here at which the two leaders' manners and words were striking for their warmth and relative ease. </p> <p> The Russian defense minister said today that although his government agreed with Washington that the United States and Russia faced new military threats, it continued to view the Antiballistic Missile Treaty as the foundation for modern arms control and sees no reason to amend it, as American officials have urged. </p> <p> ''Russia's position on the ABM treaty is unchanged,'' Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov told reporters after meetings with his NATO counterparts, including Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. ''So we would like to understand exactly what is intended to replace this existing system, for better or worse, to ensure strategic stability for the future.'' </p> <p> Russia and Yugoslavia said today that Kosovo was the main cause of instability in the Balkans and urged world leaders to ensure that Albanian ''terrorists'' in Kosovo and the region were completely disarmed. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin, the first Russian president to visit Yugoslavia in over a decade, later warned that Macedonia could be a repeat of Kosovo, if Western pressure pushed the Macedonian leadership to give in to the demands of the rebels. </p> <p> ''I like Old Joe,'' said F.D.R. about Joseph Stalin. Carrying on that self-deluding tradition of snap judgments, George W. Bush looked into the eyes of Vladimir Putin, announced, ''I was able to get a sense of his soul,'' and after two heady hours concluded he was ''straightforward'' and ''trustworthy.'' </p> <p> Ever since the K.G.B. man emerged as the Russian oligarchs' choice, President Putin has shown himself to be duplicitous (ask the Chechens), anti-democratic (ask the remains of Russia's free press) and untrustworthy (ask the exiled oligarchs). We can hope that the Bush gush was flattery intended to show the U.S. president to be nonthreatening as his administration presses ahead with a missile defense. </p> <p> The warm rapport shown between President Bush and the Russian president, just one day after Mr. Bush declared that he wanted NATO to expand up to Russia's border, represented a significant achievement for the Americans, a senior official who helped plan the Bush trip said today. </p> <p> But critics on Capitol Hill said Mr. Bush was too willing to pronounce the Russian, Vladimir V. Putin, to be trustworthy after the two met on Saturday in Slovenia for the first time. </p> <p> During his trip to Europe, President Bush is sure to face questions from Europeans about where Russian-American relations are going. Strategic issues presently dominate the way the American and Russian governments deal with each other. But over time this focus needs to, and is likely to, broaden. </p> <p> Certainly, President Bush has been criticized by some for seeming to ignore Russia during the first few months of the administration, and President Putin has made some American politicians edgy by warming up to countries whose interests are not entirely in line with our own. But relationships have a way of sorting themselves out, and United States-Russian relations are no exception. </p> <p> George W. Bush and Vladimir Putin have this in common: They got where they are by promising to be unlike their larger-than-life predecessors. Both say Russian-American relations will also be different, based on hard-boiled scrutiny of national interests, not on personal ties dressed up as grand strategy. So, when the un-Clinton meets the un-Yeltsin tomorrow, post-cold-war diplomacy officially enters its post-heroic phase. Visionary, big-guy bonhomie is out; small-bore practicality is in. </p> <p> This is more than just a change of style. Ever since the first President Bush embraced Russian-American ''partnership'' 10 years ago, American policy has been animated by one large goal: integration of Russia into the Western political and economic mainstream. This integration is still the right goal, and still very much in our national interest, but for both sides the concept has lost much of its practical, as well as its inspirational, meaning. </p> <p> Ten years ago last January, Soviet tanks and machine gunners stormed the central television studios and broadcasting tower of this Baltic capital, killing 15 people and wounding hundreds, as the Red Army tried to put down the wave of independence movements that was tearing the Soviet Union apart. </p> <p> It was one of the darkest hours of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's rule as he lurched between conservatives and liberals in the final days of empire before he himself was swept aside, first by a conservative coup, and then by the man who rescued him from it, Boris N. Yeltsin. </p> <p> Can you imagine what the right-wing Wall Street Journal editorial page would have written had Bill Clinton, in his first meeting with President Vladimir Putin of Russia, declared afterward, as President Bush did, that he had looked Mr. Putin in the eye, got a sense of his ''soul'' and found the former K.G.B. boss a ''remarkable leader,'' an ''honest, straightforward man . . . who loves his family''? Let's see, the lead editorial in The Journal would have been titled ''Soul Brother.'' There would have been one of those little drawings of Mr. Clinton over the caption ''The Manchurian Candidate,'' and the first line of the editorial would have read: ''For a guy who says he never inhaled, we can't help but wonder what exactly President Clinton was smoking when he met Vladimir Putin the other day. . . .'' </p> <p> Ahhh, but that was then and this is now. Other than some searing criticism by Jesse Helms, Mr. Bush's loopy comments about the Russian leader were given a pass by the Republican right -- just George's boy getting a little carried away. In fact, Mr. Bush's words need to be taken seriously -- not for what they tell us about Mr. Putin and his soul, but for what they tell us about Mr. Bush and his foreign policy. </p> <p> Not only because of the recent summit in Ljubljana, but from my own discussions with both Vladimir Putin and George W. Bush, I have a new optimism about the future of relations between the United States and Russia. Unlike the hawks in Washington and Moscow who would like to put Russian-American relations on the foreign policy back burner, these two presidents understand the importance of the relationship. </p> <p> Now, for the first time in years the word ''trust'' has been heard in our dialogue. The predecessors of Mr. Putin and Mr. Bush shied away from  that word out of excessive concern for their domestic political foes. But it was not just the word that fell into disuse; trust itself had begun to erode. </p> <p> Following are excerpts from the Treaty on Good Neighborly Friendship and Cooperation Between the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China, as translated from the official Russian text by The New York Times: </p> <p> [II] </p> <p> The agreeing sides shall not use force or the threat of force in their relations, shall not use economic or other means of pressure against each other and shall resolve disputes between themselves exclusively by peaceful means according to provisions of the United Nations Charter, other generally recognized principles and the norms of international law. </p> <p> Russia and China signed a treaty of ''friendship and cooperation'' today, binding the two giants closer in the next 20 years and also committing them to oppose jointly much of the framework for international security that the United States is seeking to erect after the cold war. </p> <p> Composed of 25 articles, the treaty joins Russia and China formally in opposing the United States' missile plans and places Russia more firmly behind China's claim of sovereignty over the island of Taiwan. It also strengthens military cooperation between Beijing and Moscow while rejecting the intervention that NATO undertook in 1999 in the Balkans to stop the killing of civilians. </p> <p> President George W. Bush has been bold in his design for a Europe whole and free. Now he needs to be bolder still. On his first trip to Europe, last month, he made an impressive speech in Warsaw in which he argued that the European Union and NATO, those key institutions of Europe and the West, should grow decisively eastward. How far eastward, of course, remains the question. </p> <p> When Mr. Bush meets Vladimir Putin today, he should express clearly that his vision includes a future in which a democratic Russia is eventually embraced as part of NATO. </p> <p> In Warsaw, Mr. Bush stepped in that direction. He said the question of membership in NATO for eligible and willing democracies should no longer be ''whether'' but only ''when.'' </p> <p> Eighteen holes of golf at a breakneck pace. A game of horseshoes on the lawn. A sunny spell of fishing. A 10-minute phone conversation with  President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. </p> <p> President Bush celebrated his 55th birthday here today with a combination of old habits and new obligations, mingling a heavy dose of sport and relaxation with just a little bit of work. Judging from his buoyant mood, he liked that mix rather well. </p> <p> Vladimir Putin yanked the rug out from under Democrats opposed to missile defense. </p> <p> It happened ''unexpectedly,'' as the Russian described it, when Presidents Putin and Bush agreed to work on a new strategic framework to alter or replace the old Antiballistic Missile Treaty, in tandem with lowering each nation's stockpile of nuclear weapons. </p> <p> Beijing officials took no chances on being blindsided by potentially embarrassing questions today as they met with the 1,500 members of the news media gathered for Friday's vote for the host city of the 2008 Summer Olympics. </p> <p> In an obviously rehearsed portion of the news conference, Chinese journalists from state-controlled print and broadcast outlets were chosen to ask questions about human rights, pollution and sclerotic traffic so that officials could give their carefully planned answers. </p> <p> As President Bush prepares for meetings this weekend with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and other world leaders, the White House has stressed its desire to work out a new understanding with Moscow to replace the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972. </p> <p> But the Bush administration has already decided that it will not accept a new agreement that limits the development of antimissile defenses. </p> <p> Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and the Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, played a guessing game today over what each side intended on the sensitive issue of missile defense. Mr. Ivanov said that Russia would keep talking to the United States but conceded little else. Secretary Powell, who said the time had come to be more specific with the Russians, appeared at least in public to have few details to offer. </p> <p> In Moscow, the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, told reporters he was open to the idea of negotiating an accord over a limited missile defense without discarding decades of arms control agreements with the United States. </p> <p> I understand how a position can be taken for the purpose of giving it up as a concession. </p> <p> That is why my friend George, whose mental reasoning is very deep, very profound (I must keep saying that), last year said he would unilaterally reduce the American nuclear stockpile. </p> <p> When the Bush administration took office it was skeptical of the Russians and openly dismissive of President Clinton's brand of personal diplomacy with Kremlin leaders. </p> <p> President Bush delayed meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin. Russian diplomats were expelled for spying. Top Pentagon officials charged that Russia was selling dangerous military technology to the Middle East. </p> <p> President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia agreed today to link  discussions of American plans to deploy a missile defense system with the prospect of large cuts in both nuclear arsenals. If an accord was reached quickly, it might take the place of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. </p> <p> Mr. Putin's willingness to enter into simultaneous talks on both offensive and defensive weapons, which American officials said was a surprise, was greeted enthusiastically by Mr. Bush. He had proposed both the offensive and defensive changes during his presidential campaign. </p> <p> Buoyed by a successful antimissile test on Saturday, the Pentagon warned Senate Democrats today that a protracted fight over the administration's ambitious missile defense plans would undermine President Bush's effort to overhaul the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty in coming talks with Russia. </p> <p> In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz said threats by the Democrats to cut Mr. Bush's proposed $8.3 billion missile defense budget would give Russian leaders ''the mistaken impression that they can somehow exercise a veto over our development of missile defenses.'' </p> <p> The commander of Russian military forces in Chechnya said today that his troops had committed ''widespread crimes'' in two days of terror they inflicted on civilians in Chechnya. Fifteen hundred residents of two villages were arrested, subjected to beatings and electric shocks and saw their homes looted after mine blasts killed Russian soldiers nearby. </p> <p> Lt. Gen. Vladimir Moltenskoi, acting commander of Russian forces in the Northern Caucasus, assembled his subordinate officers at Russia's main military base in Khankala, near the Chechen capital of Grozny, and in front of Russian reporters engaged in a rare self-criticism of the army's performance. </p> <p> In recent statements, Bush administration officials have called for the United States to cast aside so-called relics of the cold war. On Thursday, for example, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz told a Senate committee that the administration's missile-defense program will ''inevitably bump up against'' the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty ''in months.'' Even the concept of nuclear deterrence is not immune to this desire to clean house. In mid-June President Bush stated his intention to move away from the logic of mutually assured destruction -- ''the capacity of each of us, each country, to blow each other up,'' as he said -- in favor of a new framework based on some combination of strategic offensive and defensive systems. </p> <p> But deterrence, and the agreements that frame it, must continue to be a factor in American-Russian relations for the foreseeable future. Neither the United States nor Russia has committed to the near elimination of strategic nuclear arsenals, which would be required to move away from mutual deterrence. Indeed, both sides seem intent on maintaining large nuclear arsenals in perpetuity. So far, in calling for consultations among the five nuclear powers aimed at cutting American and Russian arsenals to 1,500 warheads each, Moscow has proposed the steepest cuts. </p> <p> Now that Beijing has been awarded the 2008 Summer Games, delegates of the International Olympic Committee have turned their attention to a vote they consider more important, electing a replacement for the president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, on Monday. </p> <p> Samaranch has held the position so long -- since 1980 -- that only 13 of the 122 current delegates have voted in a presidential election that did not include him. Conventional wisdom holds that Jacques Rogge, an orthopedic surgeon from Belgium, is the favorite among five candidates in a European-dominated organization. </p> <p> President Bush said flatly today that the United States will withdraw from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty ''at a time convenient to America.''  But he insisted that he had ''no specific timetable in mind'' about when he would scrap the agreement so that his administration can begin testing a missile defense system, which the treaty forbids. </p> <p> The North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, today repeated a promise to suspend ballistic missile launchings until 2003, saying in a declaration with President Vladimir V. Putin here that his nation's missile program ''does not present a threat to nations respecting North Korea's sovereignty.'' </p> <p> The declaration, aimed squarely at the United States' proposal to build a defense against ballistic missile attacks by so-called rogue states, came at a Kremlin meeting of the two leaders that capped Mr. Kim's 10-day journey to Moscow by rail. </p> <p> Kim Jong Il, the leader of North Korea, wound up a two-day visit to this dusty Siberian metropolis today, enlivening a historic state visit to Russia with an eclectic and energetic sampling of musical theater, tank manufacture, pig farming and library science. </p> <p> That's the rumor, anyway. Not many people here actually saw him do these things. Fewer still want to talk about it. </p> <p> President Bush's statement on Thursday that the United States will withdraw from the outdated 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty ''at a time convenient to America'' should put to rest any lingering doubts as to his seriousness about building a national missile defense system. </p> <p> We should of course hope that the United States and Russia can agree to replace the treaty with a new framework. But if President Vladimir Putin of Russia insists on clinging to the cold war accord, the administration should not hesitate to exercise its rights under the treaty and give notice of our official withdrawal from it. </p> <p> A senior Bush administration official said today that the United States had given Russia an unofficial deadline of November to agree to changes in the Antiballistic Missile Treaty or face a unilateral American withdrawal from the arms control accord. </p> <p> Speaking in an interview on Russian radio that will be aired on Wednesday evening, the official, John R. Bolton, undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, said after two days of talks with Russian officials that the United States plans to resolve its strategy for withdrawing from the treaty before Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, visits Mr. Bush this fall. </p> <p> Those who wonder where Russia's affections turned after its American infatuation soured should come to this enclave of farms and Baltic beachfront, a prize patch of German heartland until the Red Army seized it in 1945, and talk to Irina Korobova. They'll get an earful. </p> <p> In a three-story factory where Soviet laborers once outfitted fishing trawlers, Ms. Korobova, 27, is the deputy director of Grammer AG Kaliningrad, a spotless German plant whose 380 workers produce upholstery for 5,000 BMW's, Volkswagens and Audis daily. </p> <p> While his colleagues in Russia were preparing for another traditional diplomatic clash over missile defenses next week in Washington, Oleg D. Chernov was trying a different tack -- ''P.R.'' </p> <p> From Harvard to Stanford, and from Senate hideaways to West Coast mansions, the 49-year-old Russian official was busy telling anyone who would listen that the Bush administration was misleading Americans about Russia's determination not to abandon the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. </p> <p> Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld met President Vladimir V. Putin and his defense minister today for talks that threw into sharp relief the disagreements over whether to deploy missile defenses, how to slash nuclear arsenals and whether arms control talks can even be the tool to bridge their differences. </p> <p> It was a day when Mr. Putin spoke of negotiations and Mr. Rumsfeld spoke of consultations to create a new relationship in which treaties are unnecessary. </p> <p> The day after the World Trade Center bombings an Egyptian TV show called and asked me to explain the impact on Americans. I scanned my brain for an analogy and finally said: Imagine how Egyptians would feel if three suicide bombers rammed airplanes into the Pyramids, with thousands of people inside. The World Trade towers were our Pyramids, built with glass and steel rather than stones, but Pyramids to American enterprise and free markets, and someone has destroyed them. </p> <p> I'm still not sure the world fully appreciates what this has meant to Americans. We are not fighting for Kosovo, and we are not fighting for Bosnia, Somalia or Kuwait. We are fighting for our country. And Americans will fight for their country and they will die for their country. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin said this weekend that he believes that George W. Bush has a strong reliance on a powerful circle of aides, but that this circle is still struggling over its priorities, especially in regard to the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. </p> <p> In an interview with a Finnish newspaper held Saturday before Mr. Putin's departure for Finland today, the Russian leader was asked to evaluate the first seven months of the Bush administration. He said he found his American counterpart ''a comfortable and substantive partner,'' but at the same time added that he had come to believe in the ''correctness of the expression that it is the retinue'' of aides ''that makes the king.'' </p> <p> For nearly 400 days since two mysterious torpedo room explosions ripped open the nuclear submarine Kursk, causing the deaths of all 118 Russian crewmen, the 505-foot vessel has been nestling into the sediments on the bottom of the Barents Sea. </p> <p> Periodically, Russian warships on guard above the wreck have thrown live hand grenades into the water, to ward off any prying foreign submarines that may be interested in scavenging the Kursk's weapons, codes or electronics. </p> <p> Following is an excerpt from a televised address yesterday by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, as translated by The Associated Press: </p> <p> We, of course, are ready to contribute to the fight against terror. We believe that, first of all, attention must be paid to strengthening the role of those international institutions that were created to strengthen international security. These are the United Nations and the U.N. Security Council. It is also necessary to energetically work on perfecting the international legal base to allow timely and efficient reaction to terrorist attacks. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin tonight offered the United States broad support for antiterrorist operations in Afghanistan, including opening Russian airspace to relief missions, taking part in some search-and-rescue operations, and arming anti-Taliban forces inside Afghanistan. </p> <p> Combined with a Russian effort over the weekend to rally Central Asian countries to the American side, the announcement provided crucial support to the international coalition that the White House seeks to build in the wake of this month's terrorist attacks. </p> <p> After a week of unconditional support from abroad, the Bush administration confronted its first significant difficulties today in building a broad international coalition to support using military power and other means against a still-faceless terror network rooted in Afghanistan and elsewhere. </p> <p> A procession of world leaders was either on the way or on the phone to Washington seeking to convince the White House that only a multilateral approach based on consultation, hard evidence and United Nations support would justify the use of military power in response to the devastating attacks last week. </p> <p> Ten years ago this week, when the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Russia returned the historic name of St. Petersburg to Leningrad, the city's citizens did not feel universal delight. A referendum had found only 54 percent of voters in favor of the change. The still-powerful Communist Party had asked that ''there be no mockery of the name of glorious Leningrad, hero-city, warrior- and laborer-city.'' The newspaper Sovest (Conscience) demanded hysterically: ''Why rename our city? So that dead tsarism can breathe on us again?'' In reply, liberals organized a noisy demonstration under the slogan ''Lenin's name shames a great city!'' </p> <p> Everyone understood that at issue was not simply the city's name but an important ideological symbol. But there might have been no impetus to restore the name at all if the memory of the old, artistically and intellectually rich St. Petersburg had not been kept alive in the United States. </p> <p> Russia unveiled a preliminary plan today that would give foreign investors easier access to shares of Gazprom, the world's largest gas company. But crucial details were not provided, which will delay the plan, investors and analysts said. </p> <p> Foreigners are prohibited from directly owning Gazprom shares, a restriction imposed on no other major Russian company. Non-Russian investors are limited to buying American depository receipts, each of which represents 10 Gazprom shares. The government has kept a tight lid on their number, granting permission for only 11.5 percent of Gazprom's equity to trade that way. </p> <p> Western nations today gave a first indication of the price they may be ready to pay for Russian support in the fight against terrorism as Gerhard Schröder, the German chancellor, said the world should moderate its view of Moscow's actions in Chechnya. </p> <p> Speaking during a visit to Berlin by the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, Mr. Schröder said: ''Regarding Chechnya, there will be and must be a more differentiated evaluation in world opinion.'' </p> <p> By air and sea, American forces moved into position today for the campaign against terrorism as the Pentagon called up more reservists and President Bush consulted with Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president. </p> <p> The Pentagon, continuing a policy of secrecy about its operations, said little about where its forces were heading, but the signs of a major mobilization were everywhere. B-52 bombers departed Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, and aircraft carrier battle groups were shifting positions as part of a naval buildup that will eventually put hundreds of planes into the Persian Gulf region. </p> <p> Ronald Reagan liked to say, ''Trust, but verify,'' in a world that bristled -- and still does -- with nuclear weapons. </p> <p> But the Russian defense minister, Sergei B. Ivanov, suggested today that Al Capone said it better: ''It is much better to persuade someone with a pistol and a pleasant smile than without a pistol.'' </p> <p> Prime Minister Ariel Sharon returns to Israel today after two days of meetings in Moscow with Russia's president, Vladimir Putin. </p> <p> That struck me as odd; what was Sharon doing there during what some Israelis call ''the Rosh Hashana war,'' the violence that began as they celebrated the Jewish New Year one year ago? Are the Russians, who are also meeting with Palestinian leaders, trying to insinuate themselves into Middle East negotiations? </p> <p> North and South Korean negotiators today broke through a six-month hiatus in negotiations with a sweeping agreement approving a new round of family reunions between the two countries scheduled to start next month. </p> <p> Members of families divided by the Korean War will exchange visits from Oct. 16 to Oct. 18, said Rhee Bong Jo, South Korea's assistant unification minister. </p> <p> The world's governments expressed solidarity tonight with the United States as a democracy under attack, and European Union foreign ministers and NATO ambassadors planned separate meetings on Wednesday to discuss what can be done in a common battle against terrorism. </p> <p> There was quiet discussion among European officials tonight about how, in the event that the United States struck back at whomever was responsible, European governments and even militaries could assist. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia also expressed support for retaliation. </p> <p> After months of delays and weeks of bad weather, salvage teams today began their effort to raise the submarine Kursk, nearly 14 months after its 118 crewmen perished when unexplained explosions sent it plummeting to the floor of the Barents Sea. </p> <p> The operation to lift the 505-foot, 17,000-ton Kursk, which has twin nuclear reactors and a payload of torpedoes and 22 cruise missiles, is one of the most complex salvage operations ever attempted. </p> <p> A tape recording on the ground registered a scream from a crew member aboard a Russian passenger plane that exploded over the Black Sea last week at the moment the explosion occurred, a Russian official said today. </p> <p> The cry was recorded at 1:45 p.m. Moscow time last Thursday, one minute after the passenger jet carrying 78 people, most of them Russian-born Israelis heading from Tel Aviv to Siberia, vanished from air controllers' radar screens, officials said. </p> <p> Throughout the 1990's, any use of force by the United States sent President Boris Yeltsin of Russia into a red-faced fury. No matter the target, he would fulminate about Washington's arrogance, invoke Russia's nuclear might, even warn of World War III. Mr. Yeltsin's outbursts were brief but ferocious, and they reflected a widespread conviction among Russians that deep down, America's interests were different from theirs. </p> <p> Now comes Vladimir Putin -- by instinct and training a less likely friend of the United States than was Mr. Yeltsin -- to offer support in our struggle against terrorism. His presence on President Bush's bandwagon is more than just a reversal of Russian policy on America's use of force. Mr. Putin, unlike his predecessor, seems to believe that there is a domestic consensus, or that he can create one, in favor of a broad rapprochement between Russia and the West. </p> <p> War changes everything. The war against terrorism, now a hot war in Afghanistan, has this in common with the cold war: It affects all parts of the world and reshapes their politics. How will it reshape Europe? </p> <p> I have been in eight European countries over the last three weeks, talking to political leaders, intellectuals, guerrilla chiefs in the mountains of Macedonia and ordinary people in the streets of Madrid, Paris, Warsaw and other capitals. No area of European politics is untouched. </p> <p> Scrapping an outdated symbol of its superpower days, the Kremlin said today that it would abandon its largest electronic eavesdropping post in the West, at Lourdes, Cuba, and spend much of the savings on modern weapons for its armed forces. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin also said Russia would begin a long-planned withdrawal from a major Pacific eavesdropping post, at Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam, on Jan 1. </p> <p> A top aide to the political leader of Chechnya's separatist guerrillas proposed opening talks with the Kremlin on disarming the rebels and ending their two-year-old war, President Vladimir V. Putin's envoy to southwestern Russia said today. </p> <p> The envoy, Viktor G. Kazantsev, said he received the offer by telephone this morning from an aide to President Aslan Maskhadov, who is in hiding. Mr. Kazantsev said in a television interview that the proposal had arrived without conditions and that he expected discussions to be held in Moscow in 10 days. </p> <p> For President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Bush, the road to Crawford, Tex. -- and the tantalizing goal of rewriting the rules of arms control -- may have rounded its last corner here in Shanghai. </p> <p> The two leaders said tonight that they had made progress on narrowing their differences on the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972. Even before the meeting, Mr. Putin had told senior aides and members of his traveling party that he was ready to accede to an American request to modify the ABM treaty so long as Mr. Bush did not decide to withdraw altogether from the accord. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia emerged from more than an hour of talks with President Bush today saying they could reach agreements that would alter the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. If so, that would free the United States to test a proposed antimissile system while meeting Moscow's demand not to abandon the treaty altogether. </p> <p> Both men were elusive in their comments, but Mr. Putin's remarks made clear that the two nations were racing to try to reach the outlines of an accord before Mr. Putin travels to Washington and to Mr. Bush's ranch in Crawford, Tex., from Nov. 12 to 14. </p> <p> Russian officials appeared to confirm today that Ukraine's military accidentally shot down a Russian passenger jet over the Black Sea last week, after investigators at the crash site found fragments of an antiaircraft missile in the wreckage. </p> <p> ''The metal parts found in the plane and a few of the bodies closely resemble -- in shape and weight -- the shrapnel that stuff the S-200 missile,'' said Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, a member of the investigation team. ''Ukraine's evidence that all missiles fired during the training either hit their targets or self-destructed is not convincing.'' </p> <p> Until this month, critics here dismissed President Vladimir V. Putin's foreign policy as little more than tactics -- a trip to Cuba to appease nationalists, one to Germany to mollify liberals -- trying to placate everyone, but offering no strategy for Russia's future. </p> <p> Now Mr. Putin has been forced into offering an almost breathtaking vision of the country's future. And suddenly, the question is whether he has the tactical skills to achieve it. </p> <p> NATO said today that the United States had provided ''clear and compelling proof'' that Osama bin Laden's terrorist organization was behind the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. In response, the alliance said it was ready to fight at the side of the United States should it ask for such help from its 18 NATO allies. </p> <p> The alliance decision amounted to a final stamp of approval for an attack on Mr. bin Laden, his Al Qaeda network and the Taliban government that harbors him in Afghanistan and was one of several signals that some sort of military strike is imminent. </p> <p> As investigators here today began poring  over the wreckage of a Siberian Airlines jet that crashed into the Black Sea, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was said to have called Ukraine's insistence that it had not accidentally shot the jet down ''incomplete,'' and ordered his defense minister to seek more details from Ukraine's military. </p> <p> Almost simultaneously, the chairman of Russia's security council said at a news conference here that a large number of ''foreign'' objects had been found in the wreckage. </p> <p> The Bush administration, moving to strike a deal on offensive and defensive strategic arms with Russia, has postponed three antimissile tracking tests that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said today might be interpreted as violating the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. </p> <p> The announcement came only four days after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, speaking alongside President Bush in Shanghai, said the two nations had an ''understanding that we can reach agreements,'' a comment widely interpreted to mean that they were headed toward a major amendment of the treaty. </p> <p> Ahead of the meeting in Shanghai on Sunday between Presidents Vladimir V. Putin and George W. Bush, it may appear that the shock of last month's terror attacks has wiped away eight decades of rivalry and left a clean slate for a rewrite of East-West history. </p> <p> The two leaders may well rewrite history -- eventually. But the seemingly whirlwind rapprochement they are conducting is neither so sudden nor so straightforward. </p> <p> In the past month, the world has witnessed something previously unknown: a common stand taken by America, Russia, Europe, India, China, Cuba, most of the Islamic world and numerous other regions and countries. Despite many serious differences between them, they united to save civilization. </p> <p> It is now the responsibility of the world community to transform the coalition against terrorism into a coalition for a peaceful world order. Let us not, as we did in the 1990's, miss the chance to build such an order. </p> <p> Russia and the United States signaled tonight that they were near a breakthrough on the key strategic issues that had  divided the two countries since President Bush came into office, in particular Washington's plans to build missile defenses and Russia's troubled relations with an expanding NATO alliance. </p> <p> The progress was reported tonight after a meeting here between Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and  Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov. </p> <p> George Bush told Vladimir Putin last month that the 1972 ABM treaty was ''outdated, antiquated and useless.'' Putin countered by telling Barbara Walters, in an interview ABC broadcast last night, that the treaty, which keeps the U.S. and Russia defenseless against nuclear attack, was ''essential, effective and useful.'' </p> <p> Then the Russian president added the crucial but: ''But we have a negotiating platform from which we could reach agreements.'' </p> <p> I really enjoyed those pictures of President Bush and President Vladimir Putin of Russia back-slapping and barbecuing down at the Bush ranch in Crawford the other day. It was heart-warming. You don't see that very often. But you know what else you don't see very often? Such a personal, important summit meeting that doesn't reach any agreement. Now that's unusual. But because the Taliban were falling at the time, no one paid attention. We should. </p> <p> Houston, we have a problem here.  And the problem can best be framed as: How much of President Bush's pre-Sept.-11 foreign policy agenda is he ready to abandon in order to advance his post-Sept.-11 agenda? </p> <p> Days before a much-anticipated meeting with President Bush, President Vladimir V. Putin called tonight for Russia and the United States to bury the vestiges of their cold war suspicions and form an alliance with ''a qualitatively new level'' of trust. </p> <p> Underscoring that, he said emphatically that Russia did not regard the mushrooming role of the United States in Central Asia, the heartland of the former Soviet Union, as either a strategic or an economic threat. </p> <p> The NATO secretary general, Lord Robertson, proposed today to give Russia equal status with the alliance's 19 permanent members in devising and executing some policies, a change that probably would bring Moscow into the center of NATO deliberations on terrorism and other issues. </p> <p> The proposal, which Lord Robertson said has the support of President Bush, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and other NATO leaders, implies that Russia would have veto power over certain alliance decisions, he said. </p> <p> At last, Russia may be turning the corner. </p> <p> Ask Yevgeny G. Peskin, vice president of IBS Group, an information technology company based in Moscow. He says Russian demand for computer hardware is growing at a 17 percent-a-year clip. Even better, demand for computer services is up nearly 30 percent. </p> <p> President Bush will hold a summit meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia this week and will try to close a number of agreements that could profoundly change the post-cold-war trajectory of relations between Washington and Moscow. </p> <p> Meeting against a backdrop of war in Afghanistan and the national mobilization against terror at home, the two leaders are expected to announce deep reductions in the offensive nuclear arsenals that have stood -- needlessly in the view of much of the world -- like overhanging threats from the era of superpower competition. </p> <p> Twelve Russian military cargo planes carried equipment and troops to Afghanistan today in what President Vladimir V. Putin called a new stage in Russia's cooperation with the American-led anti-Taliban coalition. </p> <p> The Russian Ilyushin-76 transports landed at the Bagram air base, 37 miles from Kabul, carrying what Russian officials said was relief aid and the beginnings of a Russian diplomatic mission to Kabul. </p> <p> Vladimir V. Putin may have looked relaxed out here on the Texas prairie this afternoon, riding shotgun as he bounced along in President Bush's gleaming pickup. </p> <p> But he still hasn't agreed to amend or walk away from an arms control treaty that prohibits the kind of antimissile system that Mr. Bush wants to test. Even Mr. Bush's pledge on Tuesday to cut America's nuclear arsenal by two-thirds did not succeed at that. So tonight, at the rambling stone house that the Bushes have just completed on the prairies and in the canyons that cut through central Texas, the president shifted to Plan B. </p> <p> Now that the rush of praise for President Vladimir V. Putin's recent bold turn toward the West has begun to subside, it may be useful to examine the case of the Kremlin and Nikolai Yemelyanovich Aksyonenko. </p> <p> Mr. Aksyonenko, who runs Russia's hugely powerful Railways Ministry, is under federal investigation for corruption. That is not new: the ministry is famously corrupt. Mr. Putin made Mr. Aksyonenko squirm almost two years ago, in his first weeks as president, when he publicly denounced the ministry's suspicious juggling of railroad freight rates. </p> <p> Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, beginning a whirlwind trip through Russia and Central Asia, met President Vladimir V. Putin in the Kremlin today for what both sides indicated was a productive discussion of arms control and the war against terrorism. </p> <p> But they declined to describe specifics of the session, which the Russian defense minister, Sergei B. Ivanov, said centered partly on the use of Russian intelligence to support the American military campaign in Afghanistan. </p> <p> Compared with the loss of life, the loss of a book publishing event is an infinitesimally minor thing, but for the president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin, the collapse of the World Trade Center towers had a direct impact on his first state visit to America, which begins next week. </p> <p> Under plans laid last summer, Abbeville Press, a trade publisher on the 32nd floor of 22 Cortlandt Street, undertook a crash project to put out the English edition of ''Judo, History, Theory and Practice,'' which lists Mr. Putin as one of its authors. </p> <p> Russia's foreign minister appeared to rule out today the prospect that President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin would sign a major arms-control agreement when they meet this month at Mr. Bush's ranch in Texas. </p> <p> In remarks to reporters here, the foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, said ''difficult consultations'' continued to block a restructuring of the arms-control framework that has governed the two nations' nuclear policies since the 1960's. </p> <p> As scores of world leaders converge on New York this week for the United Nations General Assembly, Osama bin Laden's latest message to the world has provoked profound new security concerns for the United Nations and its global work force. </p> <p> How to respond to Mr. bin Laden's perceived threats is far from clear. In his message, he singled out not only the United Nations, but various world leaders -- either implicitly or by name, as was the case with  President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Analysts say that his oratory is further proof of his shrewdness in assessing the mood of both the West and the Muslim world, as well as his ability to take advantage of both. </p> <p> Summoned by a familiar, plaintive call, young men dazed from studying stumble from their dorm rooms with slippers on their feet and prayer on their minds. </p> <p> From 20 regions of Russia and bordering nations, they have made their way to an institution whose very name was unthinkable a decade ago: the Russian Islamic University. </p> <p> After a recent meeting with Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, Secretary of State Colin Powell proclaimed a new era: ''Not only is the cold war over, the post-cold war period is also over.'' When President Vladimir Putin visits President Bush at his ranch in Crawford, Tex., next week, they will have an extraordinary opportunity to turn Secretary Powell's encouraging words into reality. Unfortunately, they will have their work cut out for them -- the nuclear arsenals of the two nations are still stuck in the cold war. </p> <p> The United States and Russia continue to maintain a combined total of over 13,000 long-range, or strategic, nuclear weapons, with the only plausible targets of such destructive power being each other. The two nations also have an estimated 6,000 tactical nuclear weapons -- currently operational warheads intended for use on short-range battlefield sytems -- most of them on the Russian side. Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, among others, has pointed out how preposterous this is. Nonetheless the United States and Russia still have prompt retaliatory war plans, with over 4,000 warheads ready to be launched in a matter of minutes. These missiles cannot be stopped once fired. Russia's deteriorating command and control system further increases the risk of an inadvertent or mistaken launch. </p> <p> Following are excerpts from a news conference by President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia today at the White House, as transcribed by the Federal News Service Inc. Mr. Putin's remarks were interpreted by a translator. </p> <p> OPENING STATEMENT  By President Bush </p> <p> Thank you. It's a great honor for me to welcome President Vladimir Putin to the White House, and to welcome his wife as well. </p> <p> They call this region south of Moscow the Red Belt, because of its fealty to Communist leadership. But these days when talk turns to Russia's newly warm relations with America, dollar signs seem to glow in people's eyes and words like ''credits, investment, joint ventures'' spill off their tongues. </p> <p> ''We need the money,'' said a woman who gave only her first name, Tamara, and her age, 53, as she sold hats and gloves at an outdoor bazaar just off Leninsky Prospekt, hoping to supplement the $100 a month her husband earns at a factory making hunting guns. ''Putin promised that soon we'll live a happy life here. We've been waiting a long time.'' </p> <p> The events of Sept. 11 shattered any illusion that America is secure from foreign attack. As horrible as that day was, future attacks could be far more deadly. If terrorists had used a nuclear weapon in lower Manhattan, hundreds of thousands might have died. </p> <p> President Bush has noted the potential threat we face if Al Qaeda or other terrorist groups obtain weapons of mass destruction. These groups are seeking chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, he told European leaders last week. If they obtain them, they will be a threat ''to every nation and eventually to civilization itself.'' </p> <p> Within 48 hours of September's terrorist strikes, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell telephoned Gen. Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan and said, ''General, you have got to make a choice.'' </p> <p> The choice was whether to cast Pakistan's lot with the United States in the war that was coming, or remain an isolated and economically beleaguered state, crushed by foreign debt and sliding toward the same Islamic extremism that had brought the Taliban to power in neighboring Afghanistan. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia arrived on his first official visit to the United States tonight hours after predicting that a deal was within reach that would allow President Bush to speed ahead with tests of an antiballistic missile system. </p> <p> That deal would be the centerpiece of a meeting that begins Tuesday morning here, and moves on Wednesday and Thursday to the Bush ranch in Crawford, Tex. </p> <p> Russia and the United States said today that they had agreed to complete negotiations on a new strategic arms control accord that could codify a significant reduction in offensive weapons -- to about 2,000 weapons each -- even if they do not reach agreement on missile defenses. </p> <p> After meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said for the first time that the accord might take the form of a treaty, something the Bush administration has resisted in its quest to act unilaterally in structuring the American nuclear arsenal for the future. </p> <p> Prime Minister Tony Blair ended two days of talks with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia promising new intelligence exchanges and saying relations between Moscow and the West were the closest they had been in decades. </p> <p> Mr. Blair praised Russia for its cooperation with the antiterror coalition since the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11 and said that other nations backed Mr. Putin's efforts to extend trust to Moscow. </p> <p> Because of Moscow's exploding middle class, you quickly notice two things driving around this increasingly European city -- sushi bars are opening all over (yes, from borscht to Big Macs to California-Kremlin rolls in one decade!) and so many people have cars now that traffic is permanently snarled (imagine Jakarta with snow and ice and you've got today's Moscow). So sitting in gridlock the other day in Pushkin Square, I had plenty of time to ask my Russian friend Viktor a cosmic question: Is your life easier or harder now than it was under Communism? </p> <p> ''Both,'' he remarked. ''It's easier because I don't have to hunt for food every day and wait in lines for everything. Stores are full now. No lines. But it all costs a lot of money. The saying here now is that there is only one line left in Russia -- the line for money.'' </p> <p> A proposal by President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to fundamentally alter the structure of the Western alliance by expanding Russia's role in NATO decision-making ran afoul this week of a clash of views between Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, Western diplomats here say. </p> <p> The diplomats said Mr. Rumsfeld made an 11th-hour attempt on Wednesday to have ''NATO at 20'' references removed from the draft communiqué that Secretary Powell and the foreign ministers from NATO's 19 member nations were preparing to issue in Brussels. ''NATO at 20'' means the 19 members plus Russia. </p> <p> Russia's last independent television network, controlled by a rival of President Vladimir V. Putin, won a crucial court victory today, fending off what many outsiders see as a politically motivated effort to declare it bankrupt and shut it down. </p> <p> A federal court here overturned a three-month-old lower court ruling that the network, TV-6, was insolvent and should be liquidated. The judge returned the case to the lower court for reconsideration -- but the bankruptcy law underpinning the case will in any event be replaced when the new year rolls in Tuesday, a fact that elated the network's managers. </p> <p> In a lengthy interview published today, President Vladimir V. Putin cast the Bush administration's withdrawal from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty as a difference between friends that should not, if handled properly, crush ''the spirit of partnership and even alliance'' between the two nations. </p> <p> The remarks, published in the Financial Times of London today, were a remarkably measured response to an American decision that  has inflamed even many of Russia's pro-Western politicians. </p> <p> The Russian defense minister declared today that his nation's security was not threatened by President Bush's decision to withdraw from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty, but he warned of a dangerous new arms race -- not of countries building more weapons, but of more countries scrapping arms-control treaties. </p> <p> After their first meeting since Mr. Bush's announcement last week, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld emerged from talks with his counterpart, Sergei B. Ivanov, to say he welcomed greater Russian participation in the 19-member NATO alliance. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin did something today that might be deemed remarkable even in a robust democracy like the United States: he spent two and a half hours on national television, taking questions from ordinary Russians. </p> <p> He got an earful, too. </p> <p> Russia's navy was said to be reeling today after President Vladimir V. Putin moved over the weekend to fire or punish 14 of its high-ranking officers for ''serious shortcomings'' in training and daily duties. </p> <p> Although the navy's top officer, Adm. Vladimir Kuroyedov, denied any direct link, many concluded that Mr. Putin's actions on Saturday were a belated response to the disastrous sinking of the Kursk nuclear-powered submarine in August 2000, which killed the 118 crewmen and civilians on board. </p> <p> Last week, I induced the 19 NATO countries to count themselves as 20. That makes Russia officially part of the NATO military organization set up to defend Europe from Russia. We will soon have access to all the West's defense plans, and a strong say (in reality, a veto, though they cannot yet admit it) in every action it plans to take. </p> <p> That also transforms the West's military alliance into a boiled-cabbage political bureaucracy that I can ''consult'' into impotence. No more attacks on Serbs over our objections -- we'll consult nyet and disrupt the consensus. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin tonight voiced his acceptance, albeit through gritted teeth, of the White House's decision to quit the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, saying that the move did not threaten Russia but that a new arms control regime must quickly replace the discarded treaty. </p> <p> The Bush administration had long made clear that testing to develop a missile defense that would violate the ABM treaty was inevitable. </p> <p> President Bush today moved to defuse a potential arms race in Asia by offering Beijing talks to blunt the impact of America's withdrawal from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile treaty, while Russia signaled grudging acceptance of Washington's shift. </p> <p> In a five-minute appearance in the Rose Garden, Mr. Bush fulfilled a major campaign promise by formally announcing the withdrawal, which will free the Pentagon to test and deploy a missile defense system without restrictions. </p> <p> Six months of negotiations between the United States and Russia over the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty failed because the Bush administration was unwilling to discuss each missile test with Moscow in advance, senior administration officials said today, and because Russia refused any change that would allow unrestricted testing. </p> <p> The officials said that the critical moments in their talks came when President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia told Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld in Moscow on Nov. 3 that the American plans for extensive testing would gut the landmark accord. </p> <p> The Russian government was silent tonight about the White House's apparent decision, over its objections, to quit the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. But in academic and legislative circles outside the Kremlin, experts split over whether the snub was a bump on the road to a true Russian-Western alliance or a more serious roadblock. </p> <p> The debate had little to do with the merits of the case for or against the treaty, which the Bush administration calls a cold war relic and the Kremlin calls the cornerstone of nuclear arms control. It had everything to do with Russian domestic politics. </p> <p> ''Things fall apart,'' bemoaned the poet Yeats, ''the center cannot hold. . . .'' </p> <p> Not so today. In three critical areas, the center is holding up fine. </p> <p> Anyone in Washington planning to take the war on terrorism to Iraq after Osama bin Laden is eliminated should not count on Russia's help --  at least for now. The word here when you ask about marching on Baghdad is very simple: ''Nyet.'' </p> <p> In case you missed it, President Vladimir Putin of Russia told The Financial Times Monday that the next priority for the war on terrorism should be to ''block the financing of terrorist activities. And so far I have no confirmation, no evidence that Iraq is financing the terrorists that we are fighting against.'' </p> <p> Nearly two years after major hostilities ended here in Chechnya, the devastated republic in the Caucasus, Russian troops are killing civilians in a campaign of executions and looting that takes place alongside military operations aimed at destroying rebel forces, according to Chechen police officials. </p> <p> Chechen police authorities working under the republic's pro-Russian government said in interviews over the past week that Russian Interior Ministry units, known by their acronym, Obron, have been scouting neighborhoods during mine-sweeping operations for residents who appear to have money or property worth stealing. </p> <p> Russia told the United States in arms talks here this week that it wanted a binding agreement that both sides would make real and irreversible cuts in their nuclear arsenals, and that Washington would not simply store excess warheads, as it proposed, but destroy them. </p> <p> The Russians hope to have a treaty ready for signing when President Bush meets with President Vladimir V. Putin in Russia later this year that would reduce arsenals to about 2,000 warheads each during the next decade. </p> <p> A Moscow court abruptly ordered Russia's Press Ministry on Monday night to shut down the nation's last independent television network, TV-6, which has battled for months against what its managers called a Kremlin-inspired vendetta. </p> <p> The press minister, Mikhail Y. Lesin, professed surprise at the court order and said he had no choice but to revoke the network's broadcast license and give it to new operators. </p> <p> Russians who turned their television remotes early today to the TV-6 network expecting the movie ''Night of a Nightingale''  found instead a blank screen -- and later a tennis match from the sports network NTV-Plus. </p> <p> It was the first sign that TV-6, Russia's last independent television network, had succumbed to what its managers and most outside analysts called a Kremlin plot to force it off the air. </p> <p> The recent decision of Russia's Higher Arbitration Court to dissolve TV-6, a national television network, has been described as marking the end of large-scale independent broadcast journalism in Russia. The truth is both less and, potentially, more dramatic. Russian television has a vibrant, extensive web of local and regional TV stations; not all free speech has come from Moscow. However, the attack on the national stations may well have serious effects on regional journalism, including a return to the self-censorship that was such a noticeable feature of the Soviet decades. </p> <p> The 1990's saw a vicious battle for power among the men who became known simply as ''oligarchs.'' The media tycoons Vladimir Gusinsky and Boris Berezovsky formed a cartel to re-elect President Boris Yeltsin in 1996, then broke down into feuding. Both have been forced by President Vladimir Putin's new elite to flee the country. Gradually and inevitably, they are losing their media empires. </p> <p> For much of last year, Russia's popular independent NTV television network wasted away in an endless legal battle, victim of what was variously called a Kremlin crusade to snuff out a free press, a corporate blood feud and an utterly impenetrable intrigue. </p> <p> As if Russians needed proof, a Moscow court made it clear today that the TV-6 television network, the scrawny heir to NTV's legacy and some of its most famous journalists, was riding a gurney down the same path. </p> <p> Russian troops have surrounded and sealed off the town of Argun in Chechnya, saying they are searching for rebel fighters and weapons in the latest phase of a major security sweep in the region this week. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin and other officials contend that the rebels are linked to international terrorism funded by Islamic extremists. Previous security sweeps have led to charges by Chechens that Russian troops were taking advantage of the situation by looting and abusing civilians. </p> <p> It was 100 years ago that Lenin stirred future Russian revolutionaries with the portentous query, ''What is to be done?'' </p> <p> Two and a half weeks ago, President Vladimir V. Putin proffered an answer: calisthenics. A slothful population, he warned in a pep talk to Olympic athletes, was sapping not only Russia's health but also its potential to rebuild itself as a great power. </p> <p> Russian investigators trying to determine the cause of the explosions that sank the Kursk submarine acknowledged today for the first time that the sinking was not caused by a collision with another vessel. </p> <p> They also gave the clearest indication to date that the explosion that sent the Kursk to the bottom of the Barents Sea on Aug. 12, 2000, could have been caused by problems with one of the torpedoes on board. </p> <p> Senior Russian officials heaped praise on the Bush administration today for consenting to be legally bound by a future nuclear arms agreement, and one said a pact dictating sweeping cuts in the two nations' nuclear arsenals was now likely within months. </p> <p> Yet both American and Russian experts cautioned that the sides remain sharply divided over important elements of any deal, from the form of the accord to whether scrapped nuclear warheads would be warehoused or dismantled. </p> <p> Despite the international obsession with sports during the Winter Olympics, more than a few eyebrows remain raised over Vladimir Putin's speech to Russian Olympians last month invoking sports as a kind of panacea for economic and social ills. For Russia, this presidential pronouncement may not be as far-fetched as it sounds. </p> <p> Russia is a country in perpetual search of what is sometimes grandly called the National Idea. This quest harks back to the turmoil of the Middle Ages, when after the failure of Constantinople an influential Orthodox monk, Philotheus of Pskov, proclaimed Moscow ''the third Rome -- and a fourth there will never be.''  This dictum served as a national idea of sorts until Czar Nicholas I replaced it in the 19th century with the triad Orthodoxy, Autocracy and Nationality. As national ideas go, it sounded good, but it was vague enough for Count Alexander Benkendorf, the chief of the secret police, to issue clarifying interpretive guidelines: ''Russia's past was amazing, its present is more than marvelous, and as for the future, it is greater than anything the wildest imagination could picture; that is the point of view for examining and writing Russian history.'' </p> <p> In the rough-and-tumble politics of Russia's far-flung regions, Ingushetia has been an island of relative stability, sandwiched between the flames of war in Chechnya and a seething, and even more tangled, ethnic conflict in North Ossetia. </p> <p> For nearly a decade, the history of post-Soviet Ingushetia has been the history of Ruslan Aushev, a dashing war hero from the Soviet campaign in Afghanistan. </p> <p> It was one of those increasingly frequent moments, usually concealed beneath a thick fur coat of Slavic civility and grace, when the average Russian madly itched to take to the streets and yell ''Yankee go home.'' Except that the Yanks are not here, but in Salt Lake City. </p> <p> Russian fury here over perceived insults at the Winter Olympics knew few bounds today. From President Vladimir V. Putin to the average man on the street, Salt Lake City became a sort of national catharsis for a people who have suspected, ever since Genghis Khan swept over the steppes and enslaved them 800 years ago, that most foreigners meant them no good. </p> <p> One way to measure Russia's slow recovery from the 70-year coma of Communism is to count lobster tanks and sushi bars. Old Russia hands like me, who remember when a banana was more wondrous than a Fabergé egg, swoon at the profusion of delicacies available these days in the bright showcase cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg. </p> <p> My own crude index of the economic condition, however, is the brazen yellow M that now seems to illuminate every other corner of this winter-gray city. California rolls and foie gras are evidence of the great wealth enjoyed by an industrious few, some of whom are even industrious at legitimate businesses. McDonald's is a barometer of how the wealth has seeped out beyond the elite. It tells you a bit about how Russia is doing at the critical business of building a middle class. Drop into a McDonald's here, and you find Russians who scarcely existed a dozen years ago -- Russians with decent clothes and healthy teeth, Russians with jobs that give them spare time and cash for a family splurge, Russians with, polls show, a flicker of optimism. You find Russians who have more or less achieved their plaintive ambition to be ''normal people.'' </p> <p> As he had promised for weeks, Boris A. Berezovsky, the Russian tycoon-in-exile, released part of a film today claiming to document the role of the Kremlin's intelligence service in the 1999 string of apartment-house bombings in which more than 300 Russians perished. </p> <p> Russian authorities have blamed Islamic extremists from Chechnya for the bombings. But Mr. Berezovsky, in part of a long-running struggle with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, escalated his accusations today, saying that Mr. Putin knew ''at a minimum'' that intelligence services were tied to the bombings yet still failed to stop them. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said today that he supported the American military initiative in the post-Soviet state of Georgia because it would help rid the region of terrorists operating on Russia's frontier and in Chechnya, where Russia has been fighting rebels allied with Islamic extremists. </p> <p> Brushing aside a domestic outcry over the news that American forces were entering Georgia to train and equip its armed forces, Mr. Putin met with Georgia's president,  Eduard A. Shevardnadze, at a summit meeting of post-Soviet states in Kazakhstan today and later told reporters that he approved of the steps Washington was taking. </p> <p> When the Parliament votes this week to confirm President Vladimir V. Putin's nominee to run the central bank, it will also be voting to begin the long-delayed transformation of Russia's financial system into one that can serve a modern economy, analysts and investors said. </p> <p> Mr. Putin's choice of Sergei Ignatyev, 54, a deputy finance minister with a reputation for honesty, competence and pragmatism, met with widespread approval when it was announced late last week. Mr. Ignatyev will succeed Viktor Geraschenko, whose t two terms or more than five years as central bank governor were spent obstructing change. Mr. Ignatyev is expected to bring a spirit of cooperation with the government in modernizing Russian banking and finance. </p> <p> President Bush expressed optimism today that a deal on nuclear arms reduction would be ready for his meeting in May with President Vladimir V. Putin, and clearly moved from reluctance to enthusiasm about signing a formal agreement. </p> <p> At a White House news conference, Mr. Bush also defended a Pentagon review of the nation's nuclear posture that included consideration of how these weapons might be used to destroy biological or chemical arms of an adversary like Iraq, Iran, Libya or Syria. </p> <p> After more than two years of civil war in Chechnya, Russian lawmakers have opened a new dialogue with Chechen political figures in hopes of setting terms for direct talks between President Vladimir V. Putin and the rebel leaders he has branded terrorists. </p> <p> The opening of the informal talks in Moscow this month followed the failure of an initiative by Mr. Putin last fall to begin direct talks with Chechen leaders hiding in the northern Caucasus, where guerrilla operations against federal troops continue. </p> <p> The Communist Party's leaders were forcefully denying this week that the party was in turmoil, after an extraordinary couple of weeks in which their legislators were shorn of power in Parliament, and then turned in retaliation on one of their own best-known leaders. </p> <p> But if this is stability, it is hard to imagine what turmoil would look like. For the first time in the decade since the Soviet system collapsed, the Communists have neither the legislative clout nor the public support to block or even influence Kremlin policy. </p> <p> Hours before President Vladimir V. Putin told a national television audience that Russia's war in Chechnya ''may be considered concluded,'' bombs devastated two vehicles loaded with pro-Russian servicemen today in Chechnya's capital, Grozny. </p> <p> At least 17 servicemen died, making it the single most deadly attack by separatist guerrillas since July 2000, when suicide bombers killed 44 people in a neighboring city, Gudermes. </p> <p> After a day and a half of meetings here, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov of Russia said today that they had made progress toward negotiating an agreement on reductions in nuclear warheads that could be signed by President Bush and the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, at a summit meeting in Russia next month. </p> <p> But they did not offer concrete details of the advances. While they echoed optimism that Russian and American negotiators have expressed for many weeks, both men said that important details remained to be worked out, including precisely what form the agreement would take and how it would handle the disposal of warheads. </p> <p> ''Everything is permitted,'' that master of the Russian tongue, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, wrote in ''The Brothers Karamazov,'' in a maxim that could be applied to questions of language as well as philosophy. </p> <p> ''Baloney,'' another language master, Lyudmila Konstantinovna Cheltsova, might well reply. </p> <p> Five months after they began talking about it, Russia and NATO are on the lip of an agreement to give the Kremlin a real, if limited, say in the policies of its old Atlantic enemy. Russian leaders are openly delighted. </p> <p> By some accounts, however, the accord gives Russia more of a foot in the NATO door than the broader influence on alliance policy that some Western officials held out last fall. </p> <p> Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia capped a two-day summit meeting in the eastern German city of Weimar by resolving a long-standing dispute over Soviet debt to the German government. </p> <p> The $440 million settlement of all outstanding payments between the now defunct Soviet and East German states represented less than one tenth of the original German demand, but removed a nagging obstacle to improved relations between the two countries. </p> <p> Slava Fetisov is expected to return to New Jersey today from a visit to Moscow. But he may soon make a return trip to Russia to stay on a more permanent basis. Fetisov, a former hockey star in the Soviet Union and the National Hockey League, has talked with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia about a high-level position in the sports program there. </p> <p> According to several people in North America who are familiar with Russian hockey and with Fetisov personally, the new job could be roughly equivalent to a ministry role in the Kremlin to oversee many sports, not just hockey. Fetisov was coach and general manager of the Russian hockey team that won a bronze medal at the Salt Lake Winter Olympics in February. </p> <p> Appearing in an unusual joint interview via a satellite hookup, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov of Russia expressed optimism tonight that their nations would sign a new arms control agreement by the time their leaders hold a summit meeting in Russia later this month. </p> <p> But both men stopped short of saying such an accord would be signed, suggesting that the two sides had an agreement in principle to reduce their nuclear warhead stockpiles radically but remained split over important details. </p> <p> Following are President Bush's remarks yesterday on the nuclear pact with Russia: </p> <p> Today, I'm pleased to announce that the United States and Russia has agreed to a treaty which will substantially reduce our nuclear arsenals to the agreed-upon range of 1700 to 2200 warheads. This treaty will liquidate the legacy of the cold war. </p> <p> President Bush said today that he would sign a treaty with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia next week committing both nations to cut their nuclear arsenals by two-thirds, to between 1,700 and 2,200 strategic nuclear warheads, over the next 10 years. </p> <p> The three-page accord, however, does not require destruction of the warheads, essentially giving both sides the right to keep the weapons in storage where they could be reactivated on relatively short notice if either country faced new threats. </p> <p> The wholesale reduction of strategic nuclear weapons announced today may help sustain the slow-motion momentum of Russia's realignment toward the West, and it may give the architect of that realignment, President Vladimir V. Putin, a marginal political lift at home. </p> <p> But beyond the staggering size of the reductions -- 4,000 warheads, give or take a thousand, for each side -- the latest exercise in strategic diplomacy between what used to be two superpowers seemed only to seal the victory of one, the United States. </p> <p> The strategic arms reductions that the United States and Russia announced today represent radical cutbacks impossible to even ponder during the cold war, despite the warhead storage issues that remain. </p> <p> But though the nuclear arms reductions are a critical milestone in cleaning up the legacy of the cold war, the treaty that President Bush and Vladimir V. Putin will sign in Moscow marks the beginning of an even larger enterprise, a long-term and difficult program of integrating Russia into the West. </p> <p> This used to be the Evil Empire. </p> <p> But now we need the old Evil Empire to help us with the new Axis of Evil and the Evildoers. (Even though the ex-Evil Empire is helping the country that dubbed us the Great Satan gain nuclear capability.) So now Russia is the Good Empire. </p> <p> Volodya Putin loves his hometown. But like any love, this is a complicated relationship. </p> <p> Today, Mr. Putin -- Volodya is one nickname for Vladimir, the Russian president's first name -- brought President Bush here for a weekend devoted, at its root, to showing off his birth city. They toured the Hermitage state art museum, Russia's greatest and one of the world's best. Tonight they viewed ballet at the Mariinsky Theater, which any Petersburger will tell you rivals the Bolshoi, then glided past blocks of magnificent prerevolutionary buildings lining the canals and rivers that split this city into 42 islands, linked by more than 500 bridges. </p> <p> President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia jointly stepped into the India-Pakistan crisis today during their one-day tour of this imperial Russian capital. Mr. Bush urged Pakistan's president to ''stop the incursions'' of Islamic insurgents into Indian-administered Kashmir, while Mr. Putin deplored Pakistan's decision to conduct new missile tests and encouraged the Indian and Pakistani leaders to attend regional talks next month. </p> <p> Their joint comments during a tour of the Hermitage, including the Winter Palace, which was stormed by Lenin's guards during the 1917 Russian Revolution, marked the sharpest words Mr. Bush has directed at Gen. Pervez Musharraf since the Pakistani president sided with the United States last fall during the military action in Afghanistan. </p> <p> Thirteen years after abandoning the Soviet Army hockey team for the National Hockey League, Vyacheslav Fetisov has come home to Russia. </p> <p> Fetisov had a nine-year career in the United States as a defenseman for the Devils and the Detroit Red Wings, winning two Stanley Cups. In 1998, he retired to become an assistant coach for the Devils. Most recently, Fetisov said, he received offers from three N.H.L. teams to become a head coach. </p> <p> In a move that could reduce Pakistan's contribution to the American-led campaign against terrorism, President Pervez Musharraf said today that he would begin withdrawing troops from the border of Afghanistan and move them to the increasingly volatile region of Kashmir. </p> <p> At a news conference, General Musharraf also repeated what he called a guarantee that Pakistan would not initiate a war against India in the disputed region. Nearly one million Indian and Pakistani troops are facing each other across an 1,800-mile border. India has mobilized its troops to counter what it says is cross-border terrorism backed covertly by Pakistan. </p> <p> Taddele Gebre, a refugee from southern Sudan by way of Ethiopia, had his most recent brush with fear last month in the Moscow metro. Returning home from church, he entered a subway car and found himself facing about 20 youths, some with shaved heads. </p> <p> ''They were saying, 'You black, go home, or you'll be a corpse here,' '' recalled Mr. Gebre, a diminutive man with a degree in agriculture from a university in Krasnodar, in southern Russia. ''I was praying.'' </p> <p> A powerful bomb stuffed with bolts and nails and hidden in roadside bushes ripped through a military parade today in southwest Russia commemorating the end of World War II. At least 34 people died, including at least 12 children, and Russian news services said another 130 were hospitalized. </p> <p> It was the deadliest terror attack in Russia since September 1999, when a string of apartment complex bombings in Moscow and elsewhere killed more than 300 people. </p> <p> Following are excerpts from the arms reduction treaty signed yesterday by President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin in Moscow and from a joint declaration on strategic security, as provided by the White House. The complete texts are online at nytimes.com/world. </p> <p> TREATY </p> <p> Article I </p> <p> Each party shall reduce and limit strategic nuclear warheads, as stated by the President of the United States of America on Nov. 13, 2001, and as stated by the President of the Russian Federation on Nov. 13, 2001, and Dec. 13, 2001, respectively, so that by Dec. 31, 2012, the aggregate number of such warheads does not exceed 1700-2200 for each party. Each party shall determine for itself the composition and structure of its strategic offensive arms, based on the established aggregate limit for the number of such warheads. </p> <p> True, they didn't call it the Pootie-Dubya show. But Vladimir V. Putin and George W. Bush went to some lengths today to make the point that this meeting of the Russian and American presidents, so heavily promoted as the après-cold-war summit meeting, has a mellower and warmer feel to it than any of its predecessors. </p> <p> Indeed, it seemed at times to be almost cuddly, in a dark-suited, wing-tipped sort of way, at least compared with previous ones. </p> <p> They would seem, at first glance, one of the oddest couples in global diplomacy: the American president, who never set foot in Russia until Thursday, and the Russian president, who speaks German but little English and had no discernible interest in ranch life or Texas barbecue until he visited the president in Crawford last November. </p> <p> The first, by his own account, drifted between college and age 40. The second headed right from college to the austere Soviet State Security Service, and left it only 11 years ago. But in five meetings over the last 11 months -- as many as Ronald Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev had in four years -- the two men have come to talk about each other as stalwart partners, hailing their friendship today at the signing of an arms control treaty that they argue will bury the cold war. </p> <p> In a day devoted to celebrating what President Bush called ''an entirely new relationship'' with Russia, he and President Vladimir V. Putin signed a treaty today to commit their nations to the most dramatic nuclear arms cuts in decades. But both men tried to smooth over a disagreement about continued Russian exports of nuclear technology to Iran. </p> <p> The three-page Treaty of Moscow was signed early this afternoon inside the Kremlin, in a 300-year-old throne room built by the Russian czars and used today to end what Mr. Bush called ''a long chapter of confrontation.'' While that confrontation has steadily eased since the Soviet empire began to unravel in 1989, the accord today cleared the way for what Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin hailed as a new era of cooperation focused on counterterrorism, trade, Russia's new relationship with NATO and halting the spread of nuclear arms, </p> <p> Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov of Russia said today that they had made substantial headway toward negotiating an agreement on reducing nuclear weapons that could be signed by President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin at a summit meeting in Russia in three weeks. </p> <p> After a day of meetings at the White House and the State Department, the two men acknowledged that differences remained, though they declined to offer details. But the tenor of their remarks left little doubt that there was growing optimism on both sides that a pact could be hammered out in time for the meeting, on May 23. </p> <p> The United States expects Russia to join it in a high-priority effort to control the spread of weapons of mass destruction, now that deep cuts in their own nuclear arsenals are assured, a senior Bush administration official said here today. </p> <p> One American priority will be Russia's own ties to Iran. There is ''a wide range of cooperation'' by Russia with Iran in its efforts to develop both nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technologies, the official said. </p> <p> President Bush, who last week compressed a scheduled half-hour of Kremlin sightseeing into a seven-minute blur, was supposed to spend 20 minutes this morning at the Grand Choral Synagogue here before leaving for tea with President Vladimir V. Putin and an Air Force One flight to France. </p> <p> Mr. Bush confounded his schedulers again, but this time by staying longer. He lingered for a half-hour or more past his departure time today to listen to stories of the life, death and rebirth of the synagogue, the only Jewish house of worship in a city of 4.5 million people. </p> <p> In the Kremlin office of President Vladimir V. Putin hangs a portrait of the founder of this glorious, if faded, city, Mr. Putin's hometown and the object of his fierce pride. </p> <p> The founder, Peter the Great, was Russia's first imperial czar. But more than that, he was Russia's great Westernizer, the ruler who scoured Europe for the best of its culture and science, then made it Russia's own. </p> <p> President Bush is poised to have a terrific trip on his first visit to Russia. He will sign an agreement with President Vladimir Putin that will eliminate thousands of nuclear weapons. He and Mr. Putin will celebrate a new, closer relationship between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia, paving the way for an uneventful expansion of the alliance this fall. Mr. Bush will proclaim Russia a market economy and urge Russian integration into the West. Finally, Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin will make joint statements about their shared commitment to the war on terrorism. </p> <p> The summit will be only a partial success, however, if Bush fails to push for greater democracy. Soviet, then Russian, democratization was indispensable in preparing all the achievements of the upcoming summit. Autocratic Russia opposed NATO, resisted arms control and suppressed markets. Democratic Russia has sought to join the West and cooperate with the United States. A return to dictatorship in Russia would quickly undermine all of these achievements. </p> <p> Thanks to some dogged diplomacy and a little skillful spin, two once implacable foes this week achieved a surprising, if temporary, rapprochement. </p> <p> No, not Russia and the United States, although it has been a pretty good week for those former adversaries too, and we'll get to that in a moment. I mean the Bush Pentagon and the Bush State Department. For followers of the engrossing battle between the treaty-loathing, gloom-mongering go-it-aloners who march with Donald Rumsfeld and the alliance-friendly, deal-cutting pragmatists with Colin Powell, this was a week when creative tension produced a constructive compromise. The agreement to cut Russian and American nuclear arsenals, along with other warm-up exercises for Mr. Bush's Moscow summit meeting next week, represents both the Pentagon view that we can act like masters of the universe and the State Department view that it's not always in our best interest to do so. </p> <p> Administration officials have briefed Congress on what they described as disturbing intelligence indicating that Russia is preparing to resume nuclear tests, even as President Bush is scheduled to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to discuss arms control later this month, government officials said. </p> <p> Selected members of the House and Senate met in small, closed sessions and were told of a new analysis by the Joint Atomic Energy Intelligence Committee, a panel that collects the views of many federal agencies on nuclear issues. </p> <p> President Bush arrived here tonight for a meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin, greeted by a brass band, a parade of flag-carrying, arm-swinging soldiers and a rebuke over remarks he made earlier today about Russian aid to Iran's nuclear programs. </p> <p> It was a washboard start to a three-day visit that both sides have assiduously cast as a final elegy to the cold war, despite some clear differences over weapons proliferation and other issues that are cast as the foundation of a new friendship. </p> <p> With President Bush barely a day away from Moscow, it began to appear today that he would not be bringing with him economic proposals to transform his first Kremlin meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin into anything more than a funeral service for the cold war. </p> <p> In Moscow, that was a clear disappointment for those who have held out hope that Mr. Bush might use such proposals to signal that talk of a new Russian-American alliance will yield tangible riches soon. </p> <p> The Kremlin and the White House are portraying the summit meeting that begins here on Friday as the start of a beautiful friendship, the last shovelful of earth on the grave of superpower rivalry and cold war. </p> <p> So perhaps it should not be regarded as an omen that they cannot agree on what to call the treaty that is its crowning achievement. </p> <p> Thirteen days after Sept. 11 Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, met with 21 leaders from the Duma and the Presidium of the State Council to determine Russia's response to America's war on terror. </p> <p> ''One of the participants advocated support for the Taliban,'' reports Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the democratic reform party, who was present, ''while 18 participants proposed that Russia remain neutral in the fight between America and the terrorists. Only two said that Russia should participate in the antiterrorist coalition.'' </p> <p> NATO formally welcomed Russia today as a participant  but not a full-fledged member -- in the organization created 53 years ago to contain Soviet power and expansion. The agreement signed here today at an extraordinary meeting of the leaders of NATO's 19 member nations marked what the Bush administration hopes is another major step in its effort to lock in Moscow's shift toward the West. </p> <p> The accord, a capstone to President Bush's six-day tour of Europe and Russia, will for the first time give Moscow a role from the outset in NATO discussions about a fixed variety of topics, including nonproliferation, crisis management, missile defense and counterterrorism. </p> <p> India decisively rejected a Russian diplomatic effort this evening to defuse a nuclear-armed standoff with Pakistan, saying that it would neither negotiate nor rein in a powerful military buildup until Pakistan halts a flow of armed guerrillas into Kashmir. </p> <p> It was a marked setback for international efforts to push the two nations away from the brink of a conflict over the Himalayan region claimed by both countries. The conflict could involve a million soldiers massed on the border and, in the worst case, millions of casualties. </p> <p> In a closed chamber, inside a hulking concrete courthouse in northeast Moscow, President Vladimir V. Putin's Russia is settling a score from its Soviet past. </p> <p> Oleg D. Kalugin, a former K.G.B. general now living in the United States, stands charged -- in absentia -- with treason, evidently accused of divulging state secrets in his autobiography and, perhaps more significant, in his public testimony at the trial of an American Army reservist who was convicted of espionage in Florida last year. </p> <p> Oleg D. Kalugin, a retired K.G.B. general who became a vociferous critic of the post-Soviet Russian governments, was convicted of treason in absentia today and sentenced to 15 years in prison for disclosing state secrets to the United States. </p> <p> The verdict and sentence are purely symbolic since Mr. Kalugin, who now lives and works near Washington, repeatedly rebuffed subpoenas to return to Moscow to defend himself. Today, Mr. Kalugin, a permanent resident of the United States, vowed never to return. </p> <p> The ports are quiet in the remote Russian island of Sakhalin, just north of Japan. Fishing boats return home empty. Most canneries stopped operating years ago. </p> <p> But further out in the waters off the narrow, green island off Russia's eastern coast, boats jockey for position to catch the region's valuable crabs and fish. The catches are destined for Japan, avoiding Russian ports, taxes and fishing quotas. </p> <p> A decade after it began its spasmodic transition to capitalism, the Russian government is moving to dismantle one of the lasting legacies of the Stalinist era: the collectivization of the nation's farmlands. </p> <p> Urged by President Vladimir V. Putin, the lower house of Parliament, the Duma, passed a preliminary bill last month intended to create a legal system to buy and sell Russia's vast agricultural lands for the first time since the country's farms were nationalized in 1917. </p> <p> Anatoly Bykov, one of Russia's most infamous mobsters, who has been sought for years by the authorities here, was sentenced to jail by a Moscow court today -- and then promptly set free. </p> <p> It appeared to be an ignominious end, or at least pause, in an organized-crime case that some call a litmus test of Russia's criminal justice system, and others have called a travesty of that same system. </p> <p> The sign was the size of a large poster, pounded into a green roadside about 20 miles southwest of here. It stated its ugly message in thick, block letters: ''Death to Yids.'' </p> <p> Although commuters streamed past it for a day, it was Tatyana Sapunova, a 27-year-old Muscovite, who stopped her tiny car to tear it down. But when she gave it a tug, it exploded, ripping wounds in her legs, hands and face. </p> <p> President Bush and President Vladimir Putin of Russia made a little history when they signed the Treaty of Moscow to cut the nuclear arsenals of both nations. Yet the principles they agreed on were little different from what Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin had agreed on countless times in the past: nuclear arms reductions, cooperation between Russia and NATO, solidarity against 21st century threats, increased trade and investment, and so on. What the new leaders add is the political strength and authority to make these ideas real. Seventy-percent approval ratings have their uses. </p> <p> Now Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin have to turn to problems on which their predecessors could not agree. Iran and Iraq top the list. Mr. Putin is politically stronger than Mr. Yeltsin ever was, and he may be more willing to accommodate the United States on these issues, too. But it won't be easy. Organized Russian trade and economic interests -- as powerful a force in Russian policy today as ideology was in the past -- stand in his way. </p> <p> A Kremlin-backed bill to fight hate crimes and attacks by fascist groups passed a final vote today in the lower house of Parliament, despite the concerns of some rights advocates that it may give too much power to the police. </p> <p> The deputies voted 274 to 175 to pass the law, called for by President Vladimir V. Putin in April after a spate of attacks by young Russians on people of other ethnic backgrounds. Africans, Asians and people from the Caucasus suffer frequent harassment, often by groups of poor, working-class young Russians. </p> <p> Russia's lower house of Parliament today approved a bill to create a legal system for the purchase and sale of farmland for the first time since the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. But the measure, which requires one more vote before it goes to the upper house, passed only after the government agreed to a late amendment prohibiting foreigners to own agricultural property. </p> <p> Earlier this week, President Vladimir V. Putin played down fears that foreign companies would buy up Russian land. But his legislative allies agreed to the ban on foreign ownership on the eve of today's votes in what appeared to be an effort to mollify fears. </p> <p> It might be an exaggeration to suggest that a cult of personality has coalesced around President Vladimir V. Putin, and he himself rebutted the idea today. But he has unquestionably become a master of his own image and the most dominant political voice in Russia. </p> <p> Mr. Putin appeared before a battery of television cameras and some 700 journalists in the hall in the Kremlin where the Supreme Soviet once deliberated, and for more than two hours fielded questions with the bookish command of detail that Bill Clinton once displayed and that George W. Bush rarely does. </p> <p> The grief-stricken parents of the schoolchildren who died in a plane crash on Monday night moved like ghosts out of a white stone government building in this central Russian city. </p> <p> Some walked quietly, looking straight ahead. Others wept violently with relatives at their sides. They descended a central staircase from a formal hall on the fifth floor, where local officials had briefed them for their journey on Thursday to the crash site in Germany. </p> <p> There may be many ways to flatter President Vladimir V. Putin. Opening a bar in his name is apparently not one of the better ideas. </p> <p> Less than three weeks after two college students opened a bar called Putin in the industrial city of Chelyabinsk, 900 miles east of Moscow, their entrepreneurial homage to the popular president has come to an abrupt end. </p> <p> Mourners flooded today into a central square in Ufa, about 700 miles east of Moscow, for a wake for victims of last week's collision between a Russian airliner and a cargo jet over southern Germany. </p> <p> Coffins of 31 victims -- 11 crew members and 20 passengers, mostly children -- were placed in the square, each with a sunflower on top. Russian television showed scenes of about a thousand people thronging the square. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin strongly denounced racial and religious prejudice today during a meeting in the Kremlin with a 28-year-old woman who was seriously wounded when she tore down an anti-Semitic sign booby-trapped with a bomb in May. </p> <p> ''If we let this chauvinistic bacteria of either national or religious intolerance develop, we will ruin the country,'' Mr. Putin said in remarks prominently replayed on Russian television tonight. </p> <p> A popular postmodernist writer facing pornography charges in Russia says he fears he could end up the subject of a show trial, in a government effort to control free expression. </p> <p> The charges were brought by prosecutors last Thursday against Vladimir G. Sorokin in a victory for a youth group that supports President Vladimir V. Putin and that is campaigning to purify Russian culture. </p> <p> For 13 years, Pavel P. Khovrachyov has been a criminal prosecutor, investigating and convicting people for crimes large and small. Everything about his job is about to change. </p> <p> ''It will be more complicated to prove someone's guilty,'' he said, somewhat wistfully, during a break in an assault trial in this town north of Moscow. </p> <p> A hulking Russian military helicopter, designed for 80 people but carrying at least 132, crash-landed in a minefield near the main military base in Chechnya on Monday, causing explosions that increased a death toll believed to be in the dozens, officials and news agencies reported. A number of soldiers apparently survived the crash only to activate mines on emerging from the wreckage. </p> <p> It appeared to be the worst air disaster since Russia began its second war in Chechnya nearly three years ago. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin sharply criticized his military commanders today, bluntly blaming dereliction of duty for the catastrophic crash of an overloaded transport helicopter on Monday near the main military base in Chechnya. </p> <p> Mr. Putin, making his most extensive public remarks on the crash, said the Ministry of Defense had banned the use of the huge helicopter, the Mi-26, for troop transport in 1997, limiting it to cargo. And yet, Mr. Putin said, Mi-26's were still being used to shuttle troops in and out of Chechnya, the republic in the Caucasus that is in the grip of a separatist rebellion. </p> <p> The end of the line for Russia's railway system, an iron road that extends 7,000 miles from the back door of Europe to the Sea of Japan, is here, at a lowered gate over a rusty railroad bridge that blocks access to the Korean peninsula. Just over the Tumen River, lost today in fog and rain, lies North Korea. </p> <p> Kim Jong Il, riding in his father's old armored railway car, plans to stop in this border town on Saturday on his way home from a meeting with Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, in Vladivostok. Passing through the town on Tuesday on his way to the meeting with Mr. Putin, the North Korean leader was greeted by a coat of fresh pink paint and newly planted planted flowers at the ''Kim Il Sung cottage,'' a wooden dacha built to host North Korea's founding father during the heyday of the Soviet alliance with Pyongyang. </p> <p> Declaring himself ''1,000 percent happy'' with his Russian rail trip, North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Il, bouncily converted a handshake with President Vladimir V. Putin into a three-peck Russian kiss as the two leaders met here today. </p> <p> President Putin, dressed in a sober blue business suit, smiled evenly while Mr. Kim, in a khaki leisure suit, grinned for television cameras. </p> <p> Russia's defense minister, Sergei B. Ivanov, said today that 114 of 147 passengers on a military helicopter that crashed in a Chechnya minefield on Monday were killed, as the incident placed political pressure on President Vladimir V. Putin, who has faced steady criticism over the decline of the Russian armed forces. </p> <p> The cause of the crash remained unclear, with some officials saying the helicopter appeared to have been shot down by a portable surface-to-air missile. The conflicting accounts of what happened, along with reports of poor maintenance, encouraged comparison with the sinking two years ago of the submarine Kursk. </p> <p> The catastrophic loss of a Russian military helicopter on Monday has exposed all that has gone wrong with Moscow's war in Chechnya and the potential political consequences of President Vladimir V. Putin's inability to end it. </p> <p> At its most basic, the crash near the main Russian military base in Chechnya shattered Russia's efforts to portray the situation as stable, if not normal, and resurrected lingering doubts about the strategy for winning a conflict that increasingly seems unwinable. </p> <p> Administration officials said today that they were encouraged by a telephone conversation that President Bush had with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia seeking support for American action against Saddam Hussein, and that differences between the governments over Iraq were exaggerated. </p> <p> The Kremlin countered that Mr. Putin stood firm against a move on Iraq and that his priority was still to send United Nations arms inspectors back to Baghdad, which the Bush administration's most hawkish members consider a waste of time. </p> <p> In words echoing the language of the Bush antiterrorist campaign, President Vladimir V. Putin appealed today to the United Nations to support Russia's threat of military strikes against the former Soviet republic of Georgia. </p> <p> In a letter to the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, and the four other permanent members of the Security Council, he accused the Georgians of a ''grievous failure'' to comply with a resolution to combat international terrorism. He also reiterated his warning that Russia would attack unless Georgia did more to root out what he called terrorists on Georgian territory. </p> <p> The European Commission made its best-yet offer today to Russians living in the Baltic seacoast enclave of Kaliningrad, offering them a ''simplified travel document'' that would allow direct trips across European territory to Russia. </p> <p> Russia, however, said the offer was not good enough and reiterated its call for free passage for its citizens through the intervening countries, Poland and Lithuania, which are preparing to impose visa requirements on Russian citizens as part of their efforts to join the European Union in 2004. </p> <p> Georgia took several measures today in an attempt to defuse tensions with Russia, which had threatened military action against Chechen fighters on Georgian territory. </p> <p> The Georgian government announced that it had bolstered security on its border with Chechnya, arrested two armed insurgents and invited international observers to monitor its efforts to crack down on terrorism. </p> <p> President Bush called the leaders of Russia, China and France today to seek their support as he tried to build an international coalition against Saddam Hussein, but he appeared, in his initial approaches, to have made little headway in convincing them that the need for action was urgent. </p> <p> Soon after his talk with Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, the Kremlin spokesman said Mr. Putin had expressed ''serious doubts that there are grounds for the use of force in connection with Iraq from the standpoint of international law or from a political standpoint.'' </p> <p> Secretary General Kofi Annan smiled broadly when he stepped to the microphones on Monday afternoon to report the breakthrough: Iraq would allow United Nations weapons inspectors to return ''without conditions.'' But his news made United States officials furious. </p> <p> A few blocks away in his suite at the Waldorf Astoria hotel, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell interrupted a meeting with the foreign minister of Egypt to read the Iraqi offer, which was drafted with Mr. Annan's advice and brokered with his blessing to avert war. In an instant, Iraq's move put the brakes on the diplomatic charge that President Bush had started with a powerful speech just four days earlier, calling on the United Nations to hold President Saddam Hussein accountable for defying its resolutions. </p> <p> Russians got a glimpse of how the other side lives and thinks Thursday evening at the premiere of ''Oligarch,'' a film chronicling the wild early years of Russian capitalism. </p> <p> Film critics in stylish square-rimmed glasses, students, government officials, dark-suited bankers, and even retirees all pressed into the Pushkin movie theater to watch the loosely fictionalized story of one of the most controversial figures in the country's recent history -- the business tycoon Boris A. Berezovsky. </p> <p> A mammoth chunk of ice split from a glacier in the Caucasus Mountains and swept downhill late Friday, leaving perhaps 100 people dead and a 12-mile trail of devastation across roads, rivers and at least one village in southwestern Russia. </p> <p> About 500 rescue workers were searching for survivors today, and officials said the missing included the 27 members of a film crew led by one of Russia's most popular directors and actors. They said there was no firm estimate of the number of people who might have been carried away in the avalanche because the area is popular with mountain climbers and hikers. </p> <p> On a gentle bend in the Pskova River, near the center of this city steeped in religious history, the skeletal brick walls of a new cathedral rise unfinished, shrouded in wooden scaffolding and mired in the deepening tensions between the Roman Catholic and Russian Orthodox Churches. </p> <p> Pskov's small group of Roman Catholics began building the church two years ago, but the regional government unexpectedly halted construction in April, citing discrepancies in its blueprints and other documents. </p> <p> One of President Vladimir V. Putin's top national security aides suffered head and chest injuries in a deadly auto accident today on a rain-slicked road in Russia's Far East, and was to be flown to Moscow for further treatment, Russian television and news services reported. </p> <p> The aide, Vladimir Rushailo, is secretary of the Kremlin's national security council, the agency that drafts long-range plans for addressing both internal and foreign threats to Russia's stability. Mr. Rushailo, 49, was injured when a sport-utility vehicle crossed the center line and struck his motorcade near the town of Petropavlovsk, on the Kamchatka Peninsula. Six people, including the driver of the sport-utility vehicle, were killed in the collision; another eight, including Mr. Rushailo and the governor of Kamchatka, Mikhail Mashkovtsev, have been hospitalized. </p> <p> Military and security forces clashed today with a large group of Chechen fighters in a southern Russian republic, Ingushetia, in the largest battle this year in Russia's war in the Caucasus. </p> <p> The Kremlin said today that 100 to 300 fighters had recently crossed into Russia from Georgia, further straining relations between the countries. The firefight raised the possibility that President Vladimir V. Putin would order strikes inside Georgia, as he has threatened to do. </p> <p> A flurry of Russian overtures to Iraq, Iran and North Korea  nations the United States calls an ''axis of evil'' -- is exposing strains in the newly forged relationship between Presidents Bush and Vladimir V. Putin, American and Russian officials say. </p> <p> In recent weeks, Mr. Putin's government has conspicuously pursued a range of economic and diplomatic accords with all three countries -- from proposals to drill for oil in Iraq and build nuclear reactors in Iran to a warm meeting between Mr. Putin and North Korea's reclusive leader, Kim Jong Il, in Vladivostok on Aug. 23. </p> <p> As Russian officials began executing a pledge to scour Russia for new clues about terror plots, Chechens in Moscow and elsewhere in Russia accused the police of harassment and false arrest in what some called a campaign of intimidation based on ethnic background. </p> <p> But some Chechen representatives here said such problems had not reached the scale of those in previous crackdowns, thanks in part to carefully worded statements by President Vladimir V. Putin and other officials urging Russians not to discriminate against Chechens after last week's hostage crisis in a Moscow theater. </p> <p> A senior Chechen leader was arrested and jailed here Wednesday on Russian charges that he was involved in the Moscow theater siege, signaling that the vow of Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, to apprehend Chechen separatists in an American-style, worldwide war on terror is winning friends beyond his borders. </p> <p> Akhmed Zakayev, the 43-year-old deputy prime minister of the Chechen separatist government in exile, was seized in his room at the Radisson SAS Scandinavia Hotel at 2:15 a.m., after the conclusion of a Chechen conference called the World Chechen Congress. </p> <p> Russia is biding its time over whether to support the Bush administration in seeking a new United Nations resolution on Iraq, with parliamentary leaders saying today that the decision hinged on economic interests, and with the Kremlin still declining to lay out its terms in public. </p> <p> Grigory A. Yavlinsky, a liberal leader who sees President Vladimir V. Putin regularly, said in an interview that he believed Mr. Putin would ultimately allow the American resolution to pass, but was waiting to see how the Americans planned to protect Russia's interests in Iraq after Saddam Hussein goes. </p> <p> This is how the commander of Russian forces in Chechnya, Col. Gen. Vladimir I. Moltenskoi, sees life here. </p> <p> ''I watched with pleasure how 217 schools began their new school year this year,'' he said in his heavily fortified headquarters near here, ''how the university works, institutes work, how people visit markets, move about the republic, even travel beyond the republic.'' </p> <p> Chechen rebels threatening to blow up a Moscow theater with as many as 700 hostages, including three Americans, turned over the body of a young woman on Thursday in a sign of their resolve and turned a rocket launcher on two other women who escaped the theater Thursday afternoon. </p> <p> The grenades fired at the two women who managed to flee caused thundering explosions in the streets outside the music hall, which has been surrounded by scores of Russian soldiers and police. </p> <p> In a large school gymnasium rimmed with television sets and steamy windows, relatives of the 700 hostages being held captive inside a central Moscow theater held their vigil throughout the night. One sound punctuated the constant blare of news reports: the electronic warble of cellphones. </p> <p> It was not just friends calling. It was the hostages themselves, phoning from inside the theater, using their cellphones to relay the terrorists' demands to the outside world and to President Vladimir V. Putin. </p> <p> Much of the world wonders tonight whether Russia will be able to free 700 actors and spectators held hostage for more than a day by a band of Chechen guerrillas. The larger question may be how to extract the hostage sitting a mere 10-minute drive from the crisis, behind the Kremlin's towering walls. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin rose to power on a wave of patriotic support for his decision three years ago to send the Russian Army into battle with Chechen separatists. He has several times declared that battle all but won -- and despite a steady drip of Russian Army casualties, the public has generally given him the benefit of the doubt. </p> <p> The tent camp at Aki-Yurt is not as squalid as some refugee camps around the world. The 2,700 Chechens there have electricity and gas and even men's and women's steam baths. The Danish Council for Refugees provides flour, oil, sugar and salt, much of it from the United States. An Austrian organization, Hilfswerk, built a wooden school last year for the camp's 415 children. </p> <p> Russia wants to shut it down anyway. </p> <p> Russian troops crushed a 57-hour hostage siege in Moscow's heart early today, ending a terrorist threat meant to overturn President Vladimir V. Putin's Chechnya war strategy and even his presidency. His iron response won acclaim, but the price -- at least 67 dead hostages, and perhaps far more -- could yet prove dear. </p> <p> About 750 people were freed from two days' captivity in a local cultural center after the dramatic predawn rescue, a whirlwind of explosions and gunfire from about 250 antiterrorist soldiers and police, along with clouds of disabling gas. </p> <p> Russia was released today from an international blacklist of countries with inadequate monitoring of money laundering, in a move seen in part as a political gesture to President Vladimir V. Putin. </p> <p> The Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, an international agency of 31 member natons, including the United States, in a meeting today in Paris, removed Russia from its list of about a dozen countries most likely to be havens for criminals and tax dodgers. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin said today that Russia was prepared to support new United Nations Security Council resolutions on Iraq, but only to strengthen the work of inspectors searching for its weapons programs and not to authorize the use of military force. </p> <p> Making his most extensive remarks to date on the looming confrontation with Iraq, after meetings here with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, Mr. Putin said the most urgent issue was how to return inspectors to Iraq to verify that country's compliance with its commitments to dismantle nuclear, biological and chemical weapons programs. </p> <p> The prime opinion-slinging show on Russian TV these days is called ''Svoboda Slova,'' ''Freedom of Speech.'' It's like ''Crossfire'' on steroids, with antagonists exchanging muscular polemics while a fever chart of audience opinion tells you who's winning the argument. The other day the subject was Iraq, and it was a depressing glimpse of how America looks these days from outside its sanctuary of self-absorption. </p> <p> One guest disputant on the Iraq side was Baghdad's ambassador to Moscow. He studied journalism in the Soviet Union, and it shows: he tried to change the subject to Hiroshima. Another was a leader of a sleazy, quasi-Fascist party in the Russian Parliament, who warned that after the power-drunk Americans devoured Iraq they would soon be nibbling at Russia's entrails. This was not a pair that radiated credibility. </p> <p> The chief United Nations weapons inspector, Hans Blix, today endorsed the main demand of the United States that Iraq make a full declaration of its weapons programs before inspections resume. </p> <p> After an hourlong meeting with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and other officials, Mr. Blix said that there was ''very broad support'' in the Security Council for a new resolution setting tough terms for inspections. He also endorsed the threat of consequences if Iraq fails to disarm, saying, ''I think it is clear that there has to be constant pressure'' to make Baghdad comply. </p> <p> It was not the most dramatic symbol of the end of the cold war, but a momentous one nonetheless. In 1991, six days after the abortive putsch that signaled the end of the Soviet Union, President Boris N. Yeltsin issued a decree allowing Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to broadcast from Russia. </p> <p> Today President Vladimir V. Putin annulled the decree. </p> <p> Georgia agreed today to extradite 5 of 13 Chechen fighters detained near the Russian border in August, bowing to pressure from President Vladimir V. Putin that Georgia do more to crack down on Chechens in Georgian territory or face pre-emptive strikes by Russian forces. </p> <p> The five fighters, who were not identified, were whisked from the main detention center in Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, early this morning. A Russian airplane carrying intelligence and security officers landed in Georgia today and, after last-minute negotiations, flew the fighters tonight to Stavropol, a Russian republic not far from Chechnya. </p> <p> Three years after Russian forces poured into Chechnya for the second time, the war grinds on, but Russia's characterization of the fight without end has changed. No longer are 85,000 Russian troops and police officers simply engaged in crushing a battle for independence; instead, Chechnya has become Russia's war on terror. </p> <p> Using the rationale and sometimes the rhetoric of the Bush administration's antiterrorism campaign, commanders here said this week that the Chechen war is financed, armed and increasingly fought by Islamic militants from abroad. The shift explains Russia's roiling tensions with Georgia, the former Soviet republic bordering Chechnya that President Vladimir V. Putin has accused of sheltering what he calls Chechen and international terrorists. </p> <p> At least 40 Chechen guerrillas wearing masks and camouflage and firing automatic rifles stormed into a crowded theater in Moscow where a popular musical was playing on Wednesday night, took up to 600 hostages, and threatened to blow up the building. </p> <p> The guerrillas had wired themselves and the three-story music hall with explosives and appeared to be preparing for an assault by the police, witnesses told Russian television. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin, echoing statements by President Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks, said today that Russia was prepared to strike at international terrorist groups in whatever country harbored them. </p> <p> Speaking in the anguished aftermath of the 57-hour siege of a Moscow theater by Chechen guerrillas, Mr. Putin ordered the Russian military to draft a new doctrine adapting the country's forces and tactics to meet terrorist threats. </p> <p> A Russian military helicopter was shot down today as it prepared to land at the main Russian military base in Chechnya, killing all three crew members and one passenger. </p> <p> It was the fourth Russian helicopter shot down in or near Chechnya in less than three months. It came three days after the end of the siege on a Moscow theater by guerrillas from the separatist southern republic of Chechnya, who demanded that Russia withdraw its military and security forces from the republic. </p> <p> The American ambassador to Russia said today that Russian secrecy about the use of a powerful anesthetic gas may have needlessly raised the toll in Saturday's raid on Chechen terrorists in a Moscow theater. At least 116 hostages died during the raid; another was shot dead in the hours before it. </p> <p> The ambassador, Alexander R. Vershbow, said the United States would not second-guess the Russian decision to use the gas, the decisive factor in ending the three-day siege, which trapped 763 hostages inside. </p> <p> At last week's meeting of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, the Russian delegation insisted that the terms of reference for arms inspection in Iraq already provide adequate legal basis for access to relevant sites. The Russians believe that negotiation of a new resolution would only delay further the return of the inspectors. They have in private questioned the validity of the Bush administration's assertion that Iraq is stockpiling weapons of mass destruction. </p> <p> What is driving Russia's actions at the United Nations? Self interest, of course. Iraq owes Russia about $8 billion on loans dating back to the Soviet era; Russia fears the debts will be renounced if there is regime change. Private contracts benefiting Russian oil companies are in place. Under the United Nations' oil-for-food program, Russian contractors have been by far the biggest beneficiaries. Forty percent of Iraqi oil traded under the program is sold via Russian intermediaries. Considering the dismal state of Russia's economy, the $1 billion a year Russia gains from the program is alone an important motivating factor. </p> <p> The United States presented the Security Council today with a proposal for a resolution, revised to draw the support of France, that would give Iraq a last chance to accept rigorous weapons inspections and disarm or face an American-led war. </p> <p> France did not immediately accept the draft today. President Jacques Chirac agreed in a telephone conversation with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to try to ''remove certain ambiguities'' about the use of force, a spokeswoman in Paris said. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin vetoed legislation today that would have sharply restricted news media coverage of security operations against terrorist acts like Chechen guerrillas' 57-hour siege of a theater here last month. </p> <p> The legislation, which Parliament adopted overwhelmingly after the siege, was widely criticized here and abroad as an overly broad attack on press freedoms. Critics warned that it would be used not only to restrict coverage of operations against terrorists, but also to censor reporting of the war in Chechnya. Russian officials routinely describe that conflict as a ''counterterrorism'' operation. </p> <p> Russia's lower house of Parliament rejected two proposals today to set up an independent commission to investigate the circumstances surrounding the 57-hour siege of a theater here last month that resulted in the death of at least 128 hostages and 41 Chechen hostage-takers. </p> <p> Today's votes underscored the Kremlin's apparent aversion to answering troubling questions about the crisis, including the decision to launch a daring but ultimately deadly rescue by Russian commandos before dawn on Oct. 26. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had more angry comments today about Chechen separatists. But he appeared to take pains to soften the blow of an outburst on Monday in which he made a coarse remark about circumcision and accused the Islamic rebels of wanting ''to kill all non-Muslims, all cross-bearers.'' </p> <p> After meetings here with Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany and Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik of Norway, Mr. Putin said that the Chechen rebels made poor negotiating partners. ''What these people want is a global caliphate,'' he said. </p> <p> In certain diplomatic circles outside Russia today, not to mention entire whorls of political gossip within the country, there was but one question about President Vladimir V. Putin's stop on Monday in Brussels: did he really say that? </p> <p> Indeed he did. Nor, despite foot-shuffling and hurried excuses from Kremlin aides, was there much evidence that he would take it back. </p> <p> This week, President Bush travels to Prague for his first NATO summit meeting, seeking to redefine the mission of the trans-Atlantic alliance and to win support from its members for a possible assault on Iraq, officials said today. </p> <p> Mr. Bush is to leave Tuesday for a day of meetings with heads of state on Wednesday and a two-day summit meeting on Thursday and Friday. He will then make a four-hour stop in St. Petersburg to meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. On Saturday, Mr. Bush will make speeches in Lithuania and Romania before returning to Washington that evening. </p> <p> Hang around across the street from the hotel at noon in Riga, my Latvian contact told me that day in 1989, when opposition to Soviet rule could land a dissident in jail. Someone from the Popular Front will find you. </p> <p> An intense young woman with cropped hair and smoldering eyes introduced herself as Sarmite. It was her job to guide foreign journalists to Latvians plotting a return to independence. On the way she recounted the history of this captive nation -- caught in a deal between Hitler and Stalin that the U.S. for a half-century could not undo but steadfastly refused to recognize. To underscore the illegitimacy of the Russian presence, my dateline read ''Soviet-Occupied Riga.'' </p> <p> NEARLY 300 years ago, this city began to rise from the Neva's boggy delta. Thousands of workers labored in a monumental effort against time and the elements to satisfy the autocratic will of one man: Peter the Great. </p> <p> Today, thousands of workers are involved in an endeavor nearly as monumental: to restore the city's elegance and Baroque grandeur. Once again, they are laboring against time, as well as a bureaucracy and corruption. Once again, they are doing so largely to satisfy the will of one man: President Vladimir V. Putin. </p> <p> Russia's defense minister, Sergei B. Ivanov, outlined a package of military reforms today, pledging to improve the training and professionalism of the armed forces, although he backed away from the sweeping changes that President Vladimir V. Putin had called for in the past. </p> <p> After meeting with ministers at the government headquarters, the White House, Mr. Ivanov announced that the military would accelerate its effort to fill its ranks with professional soldiers on contracts, rather than with draftees. </p> <p> Last Friday was a workday like any other, but when employees arrived that morning at the gray, hulking Meridian House of Culture in southern Moscow, they were curtly told to go home. No one told them why. </p> <p> Inside, however, commandos from the Interior Ministry's elite Alpha squad had already begun rehearsing plans to storm a similar cultural center seven miles away, where nearly 50 armed Chechens had taken more than 750 hostages two nights before. </p> <p> In an outpouring of vitriol and insults, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia today accused rebels in the breakaway province of Chechnya of being international terrorists who believe that all non-Muslims deserve to die. </p> <p> The verbal assault was unusual, not only because of what Mr. Putin said but also because of where he said it -- at a staid summit meeting of the 15-nation European Union. </p> <p> Moscow is now living with the reality of renewed terrorism. It seems nearly inevitable. This conclusion is not the result of panic -- it is, rather, an assessment of the chances of our own survival. So what should be done? How can we avoid the next tragedy? </p> <p> It's now quite clear that the methods our military is using during the so-called antiterrorism operation in Chechnya have been transformed into methods for reproducing terrorism. This week, Russian forces further stepped up the crackdown. </p> <p> With the Security Council moving toward approving a resolution on Friday to force Saddam Hussein to disarm, President Bush warned today that if Mr. Hussein failed to comply, Washington and its allies would ''move swiftly with force to do the job.'' </p> <p> In a news conference, Mr. Bush also issued his most explicit warning yet to the generals serving Mr. Hussein, saying they would be ''held to account'' if they responded to any attack by endangering lives in Iraq or in neighboring countries. Without saying so precisely, he was clearly warning them against executing any orders from Mr. Hussein to release chemical or biological weapons or to take aim at Israel if Iraq were attacked. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia will seek to advance energy projects by Russia and China during a visit to China this week, officials said in Moscow over the weekend. </p> <p> On a three-day visit to China, Mr. Putin will ''emphasize the realization of large joint projects in the sphere of oil and gas,'' among other sectors, a close aide to Mr. Putin, Sergei Prikhodko, was quoted as saying by the Russian government's news agency, Ria-Novosti. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia told human rights leaders today that refugees from the war-torn republic of Chechnya would not be forced to return there against their will, the leader of a Russian human rights group said. </p> <p> At a gathering of about 30 human rights leaders in the Kremlin today, Mr. Putin said the refugees' return must be on a voluntary basis and accepted a proposal by Lyudmila M. Alexeyeva, chairwoman of the Moscow Helsinki Group, to allow a public commission to review options for Chechen refugees living in neighboring Ingushetia, before taking action. </p> <p> The night Salaudi Dukhigov lost his home  a tent in a refugee camp in the village of Aki-Yurt -- it was 14 degrees Fahrenheit. The local police had ordered him to take it down. When he refused, they cut the ropes that held it up. </p> <p> The cold that night last week was not the only problem. Mr. Dukhigov, a refugee from the secessionist conflict in Chechnya, cares for 20 children. His new abode, a wood-floored hut without electricity warmed by a small portable heater, is a whirlwind of shoes, blankets and crying children. </p> <p> The Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, joined Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee today in urging Pakistan to abandon its support for Islamic militants who strike India and to oppose the use of force to resolve the situation with Iraq. </p> <p> At the end of talks in New Delhi, the two leaders signed an agreement -- the Delhi Declaration -- for the ''further consolidation of strategic partnership'' between India and Russia, whose cold war friendship has endured in its aftermath. </p> <p> ''Glory to Russian Arms!'' declares a sign along a tree-lined street of the main military base here. ''Discipline is the Mother of Victory,'' says another. The exhortations echo the beloved slogans of the Soviet era. They may, someday, reflect the state of the army in Russia. </p> <p> In Pskov, a proud military town with a central memorial to the fallen Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan and newer Russian ones in Chechnya, the paratroopers of the 76th Airborne Division are doing things that would be unremarkable in any modern military, but are almost unheard of in Russia today. </p> <p> The unofficial death toll in the bombing of Russian regional offices in Chechnya on Friday soared today past 80, and President Vladimir V. Putin warned that militants were using more violent tactics in a campaign to sabotage the restoration of Russian rule in the region. </p> <p> But Mr. Putin said no amount of violence would disrupt plans for a long-delayed constitutional referendum in Chechnya this spring, a vote billed as the start of a new era of civil rule in the war-ravaged republic. A draft constitution would establish Chechnya as a self-ruling republic in the Russian Federation, a status held by a number of other regions. </p> <p> Akhmed Zakayev has been an actor and a rebel commander, a negotiator, a politician and then a commander again. Bearded, articulate and mild-mannered, he has over the last decade become perhaps the most prominent public face of Chechnya's struggle for independence from Russia. </p> <p> To the Russian government, he is a terrorist and a murderer, who once shot the fingers off a man and kept a prison in the basement of his house in Chechnya, a Kremlin aide said. To others, even some in Russia, he is none of those things, but rather the best hope for a peaceful resolution of Russia's long, bloody Chechen conflict. </p> <p> China and Russia called on North Korea today to abandon any attempt to acquire nuclear weapons but also called on Washington to honor previous agreements with the North. </p> <p> The call came during a quick but high-profile visit by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia that was marked by hearty pledges of mutual friendship and appeals for restraint on Iraq. </p> <p> Russia has signed a new security pact with Kyrgyzstan, where a Russian air squadron and up to 1,000 Russian troops will be based by year's end as part of a new rapid-reaction force that marks a major deployment for the Russian military in formerly Soviet Central Asia. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin, visiting the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek, as part of an Asian tour, said Russia would have 20 aircraft and about 1,000 troops in place at a base some 40 miles from where American troops are based in Kyrgyzstan. The planes and soldiers will join forces from two other Central Asian countries, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin issued a decree today calling for a constitutional referendum in Chechnya in March, followed by parliamentary and presidential elections for the republic in 2004, in an effort to stabilize the rebellious region. </p> <p> Chechen representatives loyal to Moscow met in Chechnya yesterday and endorsed a draft of the proposed constitution, which reaffirms the republic's status as an integral part of the Russian Federation. </p> <p> Grigory Pasko, a crusading Russian journalist who documented the Russian Navy's mishandling of nuclear waste, was released today on parole, the latest chapter in a case that human rights groups called a throwback to Soviet-era repressions. </p> <p> This morning in the Russian Far Eastern town of Ussuriysk, a local court, citing good behavior, ruled Mr. Pasko could go free. Mr. Pasko, 40, had served two-thirds of his four-year prison sentence. </p> <p> European and other leaders today welcomed President Bush's State of the Union announcement that the United States would disclose its evidence on Iraqi weapons programs, but other responses to the speech mirrored the disagreements that have long existed on the issue of any war with Iraq. </p> <p> ''I'm delighted by this American decision,'' the French foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, said. But, gently chiding the Bush administration, he added: ''It's been several weeks that we have been asking all those who have information to give it to the inspectors. We will study the American information. We will provide our own information. We will gather all of the information together in order to examine the situation from there on.'' </p> <p> This city's health department provides a daily update of the brutality of Russia's winter and, to some, its indifference to human suffering. It is a toll of those who have frozen to death on Moscow's hard, cold streets. Today it reached 272 since the onset of winter. </p> <p> ''Nothing unusual this year,'' said Dr. Igor S. Elkis, chief of the city's ambulance service. </p> <p> Few would call them bellwethers, but there are signs this week that Russia is softening its long-stated skepticism and even hostility toward American military action in Iraq even as the rumble of war appears to be ever closer. </p> <p> Moreover, United States officials have hopes of speeding that conversion by offering what one called persuasive evidence of Iraq's support for terrorists operating in Russia's troubled Caucasus region. </p> <p> Almost a century after Japan beat Russia in the Russo-Japanese war of 1905, Junichiro Koizumi today made the first visit of a Japanese prime minister to the Russian Far East, a sprawling, resource-rich region that stretches from Siberia to disputed islands north of Japan. </p> <p> This time it was not territorial conquest but a geopolitical chess game with China over Russian oil that brought Mr. Koizumi to this 19th-century railroad city, where ice sculptures glittered in subzero temperatures. Donning a fur hat in the Arctic cold, Mr. Koizumi, leader of the world's second-largest oil consumer, openly appealed for the construction of a 2,500-mile oil pipeline that would bypass China, bringing Siberian oil to the Sea of Japan. </p> <p> With some deft diplomatic maneuvering in Berlin and Paris, President Vladimir V. Putin has vaulted Russia this week into the unexpected position of being the potential swing vote in a looming United Nations debate over military action against Iraq. </p> <p> Now comes something far more difficult: deciding which way to swing. </p> <p> In the bacchanal that is today's Russia, where post-Soviet values are nurtured by market forces, where popular culture is laced with crime and pornography and where drugs and alcohol ravage a nation's health, a youth group called Walking Together offers itself as a path to social and moral -- and some say political -- rectitude. </p> <p> The group's leaders organize summer camps with the Russian Orthodox Church and trips to historic cities. Members visit orphans and war veterans. Last year, they promoted participation in Russia's census. Recently, they sent 20 young volunteers to teach social studies in Chechnya's schools. </p> <p> A short while back, Italy's leading newspaper, Corriere della Sera, ran a cartoon that imagined Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's continuing evolution. In the first panel, he was chief of state. In a later panel, he was king. Finally, years hence, he morphed into a new-era Napoleon. </p> <p> Within the hyperbolic context of satire, it was a fairly apt commentary on Mr. Berlusconi's outsize ambitions. It may also have been prophetic, casting him as a brash emperor whose troubles ultimately undo his triumphs. </p> <p> Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, Washington's staunchest ally and the greatest European champion of an eventual war with Iraq, failed today to persuade President Jacques Chirac of France to endorse military action through the United Nations Security Council. </p> <p> Meeting Mr. Chirac a day before Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was to lay out Washington's case against Iraq at the United Nations, Mr. Blair did not get the backing he needed for a second Security Council resolution that would explicitly endorse war. The British prime minister, like other European leaders, faces mounting opposition at home to any military action. </p> <p> Russia took another step toward one of its most ambitious economic overhauls today, when the lower house of Parliament approved legislation that allows the breakup of the country's vast electricity network. </p> <p> Passage of the legislation -- which had long been stalled -- clears one of the final obstacles to what economists call the most far-reaching overhaul in President Vladimir V. Putin's economic program: reorganizing the world's largest power grid. </p> <p> Ending a 30-year diplomatic estrangement, the presidents of Pakistan and Russia met in the Kremlin today and pledged a fresh start to relations after decades of alliances with each other's sworn enemies. </p> <p> But the reconciliation was tempered by the Kremlin's announcement that President Vladimir V. Putin had telephoned the prime minister of Pakistan's still-bitter enemy, India, apparently to reassure him that today's meeting would not affect their close ties. </p> <p> Russia has a long and honored tradition of exile: Lenin, for instance, and Alexander Solzhenitsyn. Now, in the latest and perhaps least likely addition, there is Boris A. Berezovsky, the Soviet-era mathematician and oligarch of robber-baron capitalism, onetime Kremlin kingmaker and now plain old self-exiled billionaire. </p> <p> Mr. Berezovsky, an intense, balding 57-year-old in svelte pinstripe, whose desk ornaments include photographs of Boris N. Yeltsin and Rupert Murdoch, lives these days just south of London in a walled seven-bedroom, 10,000-square-foot mansion, commuting with his two private bodyguards to an office just off Park Lane. </p> <p> Russia's greatest paradox could well be that Stalin, the ruthless Soviet God who conquered Hitler and created a superpower, will live on in Russian folk memory as a hero -- rather like the French with their far more innocent Napoleon. This is not masochism, but a peculiar feature of the Russian soul. As thousands of Russians observed the 50th anniversary of Stalin's death this week -- gathering in city centers and laying wreaths at his statues -- many beyond our borders may wonder whether this nostalgia is actually a yearning for a return to totalitarianism. </p> <p> It's more complicated than that. As a Russian writer who has long watched my country try to escape its oppressive past, I feel obligated to point out that this struggle is fraught with conflicted desires. A genuine civil war is being fought in Russia between productive people aspiring to a better life (in the Western sense of the word) and others who nurse an ideology of resentment for the loss of Russia's superpower status, or even an affection for the days of Stalin. </p> <p> So far in her 61 years, Dashi Idrisova has been exiled from Chechnya's haunting foothills by Stalin, brought back and promised a better life by Khrushchev, seen her apartment destroyed by Boris N. Yeltsin's army in 1994, promised independence by Mr. Yeltsin in 1996 and exiled again, to her basement, when President Vladimir V. Putin's air force destroyed this city in 2000. </p> <p> Her apartment, in Chechnya's capital, has not had heat in a dozen years. Electricity is jury-rigged and sporadic. Like many Chechens, she cannot go out after dark, when the streets pop with gunfire between guerrillas and Russian troops. </p> <p> Once again and with fervor, President Vladimir V. Putin today rebuffed American calls to support a possible military campaign in Iraq, arguing in an interview that war could throw the Islamic world into turmoil and that ''a crisis of this kind should be solved by exclusively peaceful means.'' </p> <p> But with equal fervor, the United States now appears to be pulling out all its diplomatic stops in a drive to win a crucial swing vote in the Iraq standoff in the United Nations. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin abolished Russia's border guards, its tax police and a clutch of other agencies today and handed their duties to cabinet-level departments, apparently in a move to streamline and get a firmer grip on his labyrinthine bureaucracy. </p> <p> He also announced the creation of a new independent agency to combat illegal narcotics, saying that ''we cannot claim or consider that government bodies are acting effectively enough and in a coordinated manner in this very important sphere.'' </p> <p> Although war seemed only days or even hours away, European leaders made last-ditch calls today for a diplomatic solution to the Iraqi crisis, saying that they wanted to do everything possible to avert a war. </p> <p> Few, however, entertained strong hopes that efforts to avert a war had much chance of succeeding. </p> <p> A new Constitution that affirms Chechnya'a status as a part of the Russian federation was approved by almost 96 percent of voters in a referendum on Sunday, based on partial returns, Chechnya officials said today. </p> <p> The returns, from 255 of Chechnya's 416 polling places, were hailed by President Vladimir V. Putin as proof that civilians in the breakaway Russian republic overwhelmingly support ending a 43-month-old war for independence led by Islamic separatist guerrillas. </p> <p> After Russia's abrupt pledge on Wednesday to veto any United Nations authorization to invade Iraq, experts and politicians here are saying the White House fundamentally misread its ability to pressure the Kremlin into backing a war it fears will be ruinous to its own interests. </p> <p> Some cast that misreading as a consequence of American ''arrogance,'' a word suddenly much in vogue here. They also suggested that the United States was overdue a comeuppance after years of steamrolling Russian objections to things like the NATO air war against Yugoslavia, the junking of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, the expansion of NATO and the basic tenets of a nuclear-weapons pact Russia grudgingly signed in May. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin responded to American concerns about alleged sales by Russian companies of sophisticated military equipment to Iraq, calling the accusations ''unsubstantiated.'' Mr. Putin dismissed the concerns, which had been expressed in a telephone call between him and President Bush on Monday, and said they were ''capable of inflicting damage on relations between the two countries,'' Mr. Gromov said. Bush administration officials have said they have been pressing Russia to end what American intelligence has said were sales to Iraq of night-vision goggles, antitank guided missiles and devices that can jam satellite-based navigation systems by Russian companies. The Kremlin raised concerns of its own: Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov, at a briefing at a Russian nuclear site on Monday, said Russian intelligence had found that a British-Dutch company called Urenco had sold uranium-enriching equipment to Iran. </p> <p> Sabrina Tavernise (NYT) </p> <p> The British police said today that they had arrested the self-exiled Russian billionaire Boris Berezovsky to start legal proceedings that could lead to his eventual extradition to Moscow to face fraud charges brought by the Russian authorities. </p> <p> The arrest illuminated the change in Mr. Berezovsky's fortunes since the 1990's, when he ranked among the most influential of so-called oligarchs at the Kremlin, engineering the destiny of presidents. </p> <p> Leaders and protesters around the world today condemned the start of war in Iraq, with President Jacques Chirac of France warning that it ''will be fraught with consequences for the future.'' </p> <p> In Russia, President Vladimir V. Putin called for an immediate halt to the American-led assault, saying, ''This military action cannot be justified in any way.'' </p> <p> A long-delayed proposal to erect a monument here to Andrei D. Sakharov, the dissident who became the icon of resistance to Soviet oppression in the 1970's, has run into formidable opposition from an unlikely source: Mr. Sakharov's widow, Yelena Bonner. </p> <p> In an interview today, Ms. Bonner urged admirers of her husband ''not to give a single kopek'' for construction of a $600,000 monument to her husband being considered by Moscow's city legislature. Modern Russia, she said, does not represent the ideals that won Mr. Sakharov the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975. </p> <p> A meeting of the leaders of Russia and Germany planned for this weekend acquired a sudden new cast late today when President Jacques Chirac of France said he would attend the session, and suggested that the situation in postwar Iraq would top the agenda. </p> <p> The announcement raised the prospect of another bitter split over Iraq among the three nations and the United States and Britain, this time centering on whether the United Nations should take the lead in governing and rebuilding the country once the war has ended. </p> <p> ''The best defense is a good offense.'' That favorite saying of heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey gets a half-million hits on Google, including George Washington in 1799: ''Offensive operations, often times, is the surest, if not the only means of defence.'' </p> <p> That's the essence of our new policy of pre-emption as a last resort. If threatened by a regime harboring terrorists or likely to provide them with mass-murder weaponry, the U.S. will not wait to gain world sympathy as the victim, but will defend itself by striking first. </p> <p> President Bush's national security adviser met with President Vladimir V. Putin and his top aides here today in what a senior American diplomat later called a mission to repair relations badly bruised by divisions over the war in Iraq. </p> <p> The meetings with Mr. Bush's security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, came one day after five members in a convoy of Russian diplomats and journalists were wounded when their motorcade became trapped in a firefight while leaving Baghdad. </p> <p> Heads of the three nations that led opposition to the war in Iraq called today for a broad effort under United Nations control to rebuild the shattered country but warned that the immediate tasks of quelling anarchy and preventing a civil catastrophe fell on the United States and Britain. </p> <p> Speaking after a meeting here, the leaders of Russia, Germany and France largely sought to fill in their deep split with Washington and London over the war, acknowledging that the apparent downfall of Saddam Hussein was, taken alone, good for Iraq. </p> <p> It is fitting that President Vladimir Putin of Russia is welcoming President Bush to his hometown of St. Petersburg. An imperial backdrop makes sense for two men creating empires of the 21st century. When Peter the Great built his city 300 years ago, he had two somewhat contradictory purposes in mind. He wanted to showcase Russia's world-power status, but he also wanted to create a ''window to Europe.'' (Europe's hand would poke through, pulling Russia into a more modern era.) The question is which of the two St. Petersburgs Mr. Bush will focus on: the gold-encrusted imperial capital, or the portal to the West and its values of human rights and liberal democracy. </p> <p> My guess is that he'll pick the first, because that's the one President Putin wants him to see. Gone are the days when American presidents stood up to their Russian counterparts and openly pressed them to bring about democratic reform. Now relations at the top are largely about personal friendship. Diplomacy is tied to personality. Bill Clinton related to Russia largely in terms of his relationship with Boris Yeltsin. Mr. Bush has followed suit, making American policy a hostage to his personal attachment to Mr. Putin. </p> <p> When President Vladimir V. Putin meets President Bush in St. Petersburg on Saturday, more than a few questions will be asked about how Russia's steely leader opposed a hyperpower over the war in Iraq and came away unscathed. </p> <p> The answer lies somewhere between Mr. Bush's evident personal regard for the Russian leader and Mr. Putin's skill in playing his hand on the world stage. Yet for all his stature abroad, Mr. Putin is looking increasingly vulnerable at home, facing growing fears that his dominance of the state machinery has peaked. </p> <p> Last month Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain traveled to Moscow to discuss postwar Iraq with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Although the war was effectively over, Mr. Putin remained skeptical of its aims. ''Where is Saddam?'' Mr. Putin asked at a press conference after the meeting. Where, he continued, were the weapons of mass destruction, ''if they really existed?'' </p> <p> This weekend, President Bush is scheduled to meet with Mr. Putin in St. Petersburg. He might face a similarly rude awakening. </p> <p> President Bush and President Vladimir Putin of Russia will have much to discuss when they sit down in St. Petersburg today: Iraq, terrorism, nuclear arsenals, NATO expansion. It is vital, however, that they also address Russia's mounting health crisis. </p> <p> As Mr. Putin has pointed out in two of his four state of the union messages, Russia faces shocking demographic trends. For every 10 babies born, 17 Russians die. The government predicts that the population will decrease 30 percent to 40 percent by 2050. And even these dismal figures may be too optimistic, as they are based on Western European models of public health and not the Russian reality of widespread substance abuse and tuberculosis and pending AIDS epidemics. </p> <p> Its manhole covers sealed, rain-dispersing air force circling aloft, unsightly shacks summarily torched, quadrilingual phrase books issued to police and cellular phone encryption disabled, Russia's baroque czarist capital is girded this weekend to wrap President Bush and nearly 45 other world leaders in an extravagant bear hug to celebrate its 300th birthday. </p> <p> Peter, as the locals call it, has perhaps not been at once this radiant and this tense since the Russian Revolution, in 1917. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia today outlined an unusually bleak vision of a country mired in poverty, strangled by bureaucracy and facing ominous threats from inside and out. Going into election season here, he offered, as an answer, an unusually ambitious platform of economic expansion, governmental reforms and military modernization, including the development of new nuclear weapons. </p> <p> Delivering his third annual address to lawmakers in the Kremlin, Mr. Putin portrayed Russia as standing at a crossroads, past the tumultuous transition to capitalism but still unable to compete against the ''highly developed'' nations which ''we see around us.'' </p> <p> A truck loaded with explosives blew up near a government complex in northern Chechnya today in what officials said was a suicidal terrorist attack. The blast killed at least 41 people and wounded scores more, many of them gravely, in a region that had until now escaped the worst of Russia's war against Chechen separatists. </p> <p> The attack today was the worst convulsion of violence in Chechnya since Russia held a constitutional referendum there in March as part of the Kremlin's efforts to hasten a peaceful end to the war after 44 months of violent conflict. Officials said the death toll -- already among the worst single attacks in the war -- could rise still higher. </p> <p> As the death toll from a truck bombing in Chechnya on Monday rose steadily higher, President Vladimir V. Putin drew a direct parallel today between that attack and those that occurred in Saudi Arabia only hours later. </p> <p> While Mr. Putin has previously accused international terrorist groups of fueling Chechnya's separatist movement, he used the timing of the attacks -- and the occasion of a meeting with NATO ambassadors here today -- to portray Russia's war in Chechnya as part of a global war against terrorism. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin proposed granting amnesty today to Chechen separatists who agreed to lay down their arms by Aug. 1, but the offer would exclude any accused of murder, rape, kidnapping or other crimes. </p> <p> Mr. Putin's proposal followed two suicide attacks in Chechnya this week that had by today killed at least 77 people and shattered once again the Kremlin's assertions that peace and stability in the republic were at hand after 44 months of war. </p> <p> The office of Russia's military prosecutor has filed criminal charges against an army commander stemming from the crash of a mammoth military helicopter in Chechnya last August and acknowledged that the death toll was higher than previously reported, officials said today. </p> <p> The helicopter, a transport aircraft that was grossly overloaded with at least 147 passengers, was shot down by Chechen fighters on Aug. 19 and crashed in a minefield as it approached the main Russian military base in Chechnya, just east of the republic's capital, Grozny. It was the single worst loss of life in Russia's second war in Chechnya, now in its fourth year. </p> <p> May Day would not be May Day without revelry and political marches on the streets of Russia's capital. But how to account for the upside-down, inside-out scene that played out in downtown Moscow today? </p> <p> In sunlit Pushkin Square, thousands gathered to hear a leading figure of the Kremlin's wholly owned-and-operated political party, United Russia, denounce President Vladimir V. Putin's government as a tool of business moguls and its economic and social policies as ''a disgrace.'' </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, seeking to heal relations bruised by the war in Iraq, has written to President Bush seeking cooperation ''on all levels,'' a senior Russian official said today. </p> <p> The letter, delivered by Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov during his visit here, was to help set the stage for a meeting between the two presidents in the Russian city of St. Petersburg, the Russian official said. </p> <p> After weeks of pointed Russian protests over the war in Iraq, President Vladimir V. Putin and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell declared today that Russia and the United States had overcome their recent differences. They then met in the Kremlin and failed to resolve some of the most contentious of those, involving the future of Iraq. </p> <p> Mr. Powell, emerging from the meeting tonight with the Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, said the two countries still had ''outstanding issues'' over Iraq. Those included the return of international weapons inspectors and the terms of a new United Nations resolution giving the United States and its allies broad control to govern postwar Iraq. </p> <p> How exactly do you put into words  no, into song -- the great union of Belarus and Russia, especially when their two leaders cannot agree on what exactly the union is or should be? </p> <p> ''What we need is to find a really good piece of music,'' explained Igor M. Luchenok, a composer here. ''It could be a waltz. It could be a tango. I don't know. </p> <p> Having wined, dined and entertained about 45 global leaders long into Friday night, President Vladimir V. Putin shuttled Europe's heads of state to an opulent czarist palace outside St. Petersburg this morning to request politely that they open their borders wider to visiting Russians. </p> <p> The Europeans heaped praise on Mr. Putin's skills as a host. Then they just as politely declined his request, openly concerned that unfettered visits would lead to a surge in crime and illegal migration. </p> <p> President Bush affirmed today his commitment to the half-century relationship between Europe and the United States, but he indicated that he expected traditional allies that opposed him in the war on Iraq, like Germany and France, to conform to an American vision of a shared future. </p> <p> ''This is no time to stir up divisions in a great alliance,'' Mr. Bush said in a speech on a warm, sun-drenched morning at Wawel Castle in Krakow, Poland, before arriving here this evening for meetings with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and a celebration of St. Petersburg's founding 300 years ago by Peter the Great. </p> <p> Prime Minister Tony Blair and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said today that they had put their differences over Iraq behind them, and they pointed to new energy deals that will make Britain the world's largest foreign investor in Russia. </p> <p> In a joint news conference capping a four-day state visit to Britain by the Russian leader, the two men traded assurances that their public disagreements about the war were a thing of the past and would not undermine future cooperation. </p> <p> As the Kremlin inches toward elections in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, the Moscow-appointed head of the government there has proposed giving Chechnya what it has always wanted -- more autonomy. </p> <p> Many Chechens interpreted the move as a way for the local leader, Akhmad Kadyrov, to improve his standing ahead of elections, which the newly created Chechen State Council has set for October. </p> <p> A truck exploded near a government complex in Chechnya today in what officials said was the fourth suicide bombing in or near the republic in five weeks. At least two people, believed to be suicide bombers, died and several more were wounded, the officials said. </p> <p> The attack occurred this afternoon in the Staropromyslovksy district of Chechnya's capital, Grozny, not far from police headquarters and a regional office of Russia's Interior Ministry. </p> <p> Leaders of the major industrialized countries managed to put aside their differences over the American-led war on Iraq today, saying they shared a common interest in rebuilding the nation into a stable democracy. </p> <p> ''Our shared objective is a fully sovereign, stable and democratic Iraq, at peace with its neighbors and firmly on the road to progress,'' they said in a statement today. </p> <p> At first, investors shrugged off the series of raids on the periphery of the empire of Russia's richest man, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, as just a passing unpleasantness. Now, as the wrangle drags into its fourth week, investors are starting to worry. </p> <p> Russian authorities began a series of investigations against allies and companies of Mr. Khodorkovsky in the three weeks beginning July 2. The charges include fraud, tax evasion and even murder. </p> <p> In the quiet of the Russian summer, a noisy political brawl is rewriting the rules of Russian politics. </p> <p> During the past two weeks, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man and one of its most powerful, has watched as federal prosecutors hit his oil company and his allies with a flurry of criminal charges, including theft of state property, tax evasion and even murder. In a piece of Russian-style police theatrics, masked officers toting automatic weapons raided his office archives. </p> <p> In a political wrangle of a kind not seen in Russia since the early days of Vladimir V. Putin's presidency, the authorities have arrested a top executive at the financial group that owns Russia's largest oil company. </p> <p> The executive, Platon Lebedev, chairman of Menatep, the company that owns 61 percent of the Yukos Oil Company, was arrested on Wednesday. The general prosecutor's office suspects him of embezzling from a state company in 1994, a charge he denies. Mr. Lebedev was convalescing in a hospital when arrested and was led out in handcuffs, a Yukos executive said. </p> <p> The day after two suicide bombers killed themselves and at least 13 others at a Moscow rock festival, President Vladimir V. Putin today canceled a planned trip abroad, and his interior minister pledged that those behind the attack ''will be brought to justice and punished.'' </p> <p> Mr. Putin's aides insisted that such violence would not derail plans to bring a popularly elected government and a workable peace to Chechnya, the southwestern province whose four-year separatist war appears almost certainly to be tied to the bombings on Saturday. </p> <p> In a closed session today, the Moscow City Court denied bail to a business partner of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man and one of its most powerful. </p> <p> The court rejected an appeal to release the man, Platon Lebedev, on bail. Mr. Lebedev was arrested on July 2 and accused of violating a 1994 privatization program, a charge he denies. </p> <p> A British arms dealer was arrested today in Newark on charges that he tried to sell a Russian-made surface-to-air missile to an American undercover agent posing as an operative for Al Qaeda, law enforcement officials said. </p> <p> A shoulder-fired SA-18 missile and launcher, which had been made inoperable as part of a sting operation, were seized today by American investigators, acting with extensive help from Russian and British authorities, officials said. The missile, when armed, is capable of bringing down a commercial airliner. </p> <p> This summer's biggest scandal  the prosecution swirling around Russia's richest and most powerful company, Yukos Oil -- has spawned endless speculation about who really wields power under President Vladimir V. Putin. </p> <p> Everybody has a theory, but no one outside the Kremlin really knows, and no one inside will say. </p> <p> The golden age of Soviet sociology came twice, interrupted by periods of dark years. Now sociology in the former Soviet Union is facing another threat to its independence, this time from President Vladimir Putin. And once again Yuri Levada, the country's most respected sociologist, is under attack. </p> <p> Sociology in the Soviet Union essentially began in the early 1960's. At first we were allowed to study Soviet public opinion with relative freedom. No questions were allowed about people's attitudes toward private property, religion or the Communist Party -- and certainly not about Comrade Brezhnev. Yet by 1966, national surveys were asking people's opinions of Soviet newspapers, even Pravda. </p> <p> Anna N. Aldukhova, 19, stood on a corner of Uprising Square wearing a blue cap and windbreaker that bore the name of the front-runner in this city's approaching gubernatorial runoff. She passed out leaflets promising a better quality of life. No one paid much attention. </p> <p> For a campaign volunteer, she hardly seemed enthusiastic herself. ''People are a little bit tired of promises -- and don't believe any of them anymore,'' she said as men and women bustled by, most of them ignoring her outstretched hand. </p> <p> President Bush welcomed President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to Camp David today for another meeting intended to show the two as problem-solvers who work best in informal settings, even as they appear still divided on Iraq and on Russia's continued insistence that its sales of nuclear technology to Iran are benign. </p> <p> The meeting came during a week when the International Atomic Energy Agency has found new evidence that Iran is enriching uranium. Mr. Putin, who expressed doubts two years ago that Iran was seeking nuclear weapons, has begun to concede that Tehran may be doing exactly that -- even while denying that Russian technology is contributing to the effort. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has portrayed the investigations swirling around Russia's richest company, Yukos Oil, as an isolated criminal matter that do not signal a wholesale review of the country's privatization of state assets in the 1990's. </p> <p> Making his first direct remarks on the Yukos affair since it erupted in July with the arrest of a major stockholder, Mr. Putin said in an interview with American journalists on Saturday evening that as president he could not interfere with the independence of prosecutors, who he said were simply upholding the law. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said today that he would send ''a clear but respectful signal to Iran'' that it must comply with international inspections of its suspected nuclear weapons program. But he told President Bush that Russia would go forward with its plans to help Iran build a nuclear reactor. </p> <p> Mr. Putin's statement this morning that he would not terminate Russia's $800 million commercial nuclear contract with Iran came as a brief, and almost cryptic, aside in response to a question at a news conference with Mr. Bush at the presidential retreat at Camp David. </p> <p> As President Bush meets with President Vladimir Putin of Russia today and tomorrow at Camp David, he should take the opportunity to chart a new course for Russian-American relations. The logic for such a change is compelling, especially regarding United States interests in Iraq, and it is clear to Russian officials in both government and industry. </p> <p> This new thinking is the product of several factors involving the common experience of Russia and the United States as victims of terrorism and a common interest in nurturing greater stability in the Middle East. The countries' complementary capacities could accelerate the rebuilding of Iraq and help to end the violence there. </p> <p> Arjan Erkel, a humanitarian aid worker in Dagestan, a Russian republic that borders Chechnya, was kidnapped on the night of Aug. 12, 2002. </p> <p> Mr. Erkel, a 33-year-old Dutch citizen who was leading an effort to provide medical services and other assistance in a region ravaged by war and terror, was seized and driven away by three gunmen. It was later learned that he was also being followed by members of the Russian Federal Security Service, the successor to the K.G.B. The agents tailing him did not intervene to prevent the abduction. </p> <p> The leaders of France, Germany and Britain failed today to make any apparent progress toward a common position on the American draft of a Security Council resolution, which would authorize countries to contribute money and troops in the rebuilding of Iraq. </p> <p> The three held a much anticipated meeting here and agreed afterward that sovereignty should be transferred to an Iraqi civilian authority as soon as possible and that the United Nations should have a key role in that process. </p> <p> The Russian stock markets recovered somewhat on Tuesday from a plummet that followed the arrest of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the head of the oil giant Yukos and the country's wealthiest citizen, on charges of tax evasion, fraud and forgery. </p> <p> On Monday, two days after Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest at gunpoint in Siberia, the main stock market index dropped 10 percent, and Yukos shares slid 15 percent. </p> <p> Reports that President Vladimir V. Putin's powerful chief of staff resigned in protest over the arrest of the country's richest businessman heightened concern on Wednesday that the Kremlin had gone a step too far in cracking down on him and his oil company, risking capital flight and political instability. </p> <p> Aleksandr S. Voloshin, a quiet but influential figure known as Mr. Putin's ''gray cardinal,'' submitted his resignation on Saturday, the day that masked agents arrested the tycoon, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky aboard his private jet in Siberia, according to published reports and an analyst with ties to the Kremlin. </p> <p> In the predawn Siberian darkness five days ago, agents of the Russian security agency stormed the private jet of Russia's richest man. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the chief executive and principal owner of Russia's largest oil company, Yukos, was arrested and charged with tax evasion, fraud, forgery and embezzlement. </p> <p> Mr. Khodorkovsky now awaits his fate in a Moscow prison, where prosecutors can hold him for up to two months while they decide whether to pursue a trial. But his arrest has already raised profound questions for post-Soviet Russia. It has exposed the complex and deep divisions within the elite and the public alike about the nature of state control over the economy, the role of big business in politics and the influence of personal wealth in what still is a poor society. </p> <p> China and Russia offered their support on Wednesday for the latest version of the draft Security Council resolution on Iraq's future, putting heavy pressure on Germany and France to vote in favor of the measure, rather than join Syria in abstaining, Council diplomats said. </p> <p> Washington agreed late on Wednesday to postpone the vote until Thursday to give the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, time to try to persuade the French president, Jacques Chirac, and the German chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, to accept the draft, diplomats here said. Mr. Putin was traveling to Kuala Lumpur for a summit meeting of Muslim countries. </p> <p> Following are remarks by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia from an interview on Saturday, as transcribed and translated by The New York Times. A more complete version of his remarks is online at nytimes.com/world. </p> <p> I. On the need for an international mandate for the American-led occupation of Iraq: </p> <p> MR. PUTIN -- We think that Iraq's problems can be efficiently solved only with involvement of the Iraqi people themselves. This task has to be solved with their participation and by their hands. But so that it would be efficient they have to believe in our serious intentions, in our desire to restore sovereignty. This is why we think that the U.N.'s role has to be increased -- not because we would like to diminish the significance of the United States, but in order to change the situation in Iraq itself. </p> <p> The Kremlin's hand-picked candidate for president of Chechnya, Ahmad Kadyrov, has secured victory, the election commission chief said Monday. His stage-managed election followed a campaign consisting of threats, violence and manipulation. </p> <p> Speaking as the ballots were still being counted from the vote on Sunday, the commission chief, Abdul-Karim Arsakhanov, said Mr. Kadyrov had already gained more than half the votes, the Interfax news agency reported. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia says the United States now faces in Iraq the possibility of a prolonged, violent and ultimately futile war like the one that mired the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. </p> <p> In an expansive interview on Saturday evening, Mr. Putin warned that Iraq could ''become a new center, a new magnet for all destructive elements.'' He added, without naming them, that ''a great number of members of different terrorist organizations'' have been drawn into the country since the fall of Saddam Hussein. [Excerpts, Page A8.] </p> <p> The arrest of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the head of Yukos, the largest oil company in Russia, and the country's richest man, is bound to unnerve even the most stolid of investors in Russia, bankers and market observers say. </p> <p> ''Two words,'' predicted one investment banker in Moscow, when asked how he thought investors would react. ''Capital flight.'' </p> <p> There is a question that irritates President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and it is the one about his past as a foreign intelligence operative of the K.G.B. </p> <p> ''They cannot forget about that agency,'' he replied, seemingly to his aides, when asked a version of it in an expansive interview at his wooded presidential estate outside of Moscow. He chuckled, but not warmly. </p> <p> Prosecutors on Thursday froze stock worth billions of dollars in Russia's richest company, Yukos Oil, raising the stakes in their investigation of its imprisoned chief executive, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky. </p> <p> The move came as the Kremlin announced that President Vladimir V. Putin had removed his chief of staff, Aleksandr S. Voloshin, who had already submitted his resignation to protest Mr. Khodorkovsky's arrest. Mr. Putin replaced him with Dmitri A. Medvedev, 38, a lawyer who had been Mr. Voloshin's deputy. </p> <p> Russia's Constitutional Court on Thursday overturned a crucial section of a sweeping law that had severely restricted news coverage of election campaigns, and had even prompted some news organizations to avoid election coverage altogether for fear of being accused of bias and electioneering. </p> <p> ''Elections are free only when the right to information and freedom of expression of opinions are truly guaranteed,'' said Valery D. Zorkin, the chairman of the court, who read out the decision. </p> <p> Russia lurched toward a political and economic crisis on Monday as the country's stocks, bonds and currency plummeted after the weekend arrest of Russia's richest man, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin, speaking publicly about the arrest for the first time, called for an end to ''hysteria and speculations,'' which reached a new fervor in the two days since masked agents seized Mr. Khodorkovsky, the chairman of Yukos Oil, aboard his corporate jet during a refueling stop in Siberia. </p> <p> Russia's richest man, the oil baron Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, was seized at gunpoint on Saturday by government security agents and jailed on charges of fraud and tax evasion. </p> <p> The aggressive move against Mr. Khodorkovsky, 40, heightens longstanding tensions between the government of President Vladimir V. Putin and Russia's superrich oligarchs, some of whom have fled the country. </p> <p> Yukos, Russia's No.1 oil company, reported a 26 percent surge in quarterly profit on Monday as the company's battle with political authorities at home continued to escalate. </p> <p> Second-quarter profit jumped to $955 million, from $758 million in the period a year earlier. Sales soared 49 percent, to $3.83 billion, which the company attributed to higher production volumes and oil prices. Operating expenses also increased, rising 40 percent, to $494 million, from a year ago. </p> <p> The Russian government went on a charm offensive Thursday, with liberal Kremlin aides and international financial aid officials saying the country was not headed toward a reversal on privatized property after the arrest of the country's wealthiest businessman. </p> <p> ''The president underlined that there would be no deprivatization,'' Andrei N. Illarionov, a senior Kremlin economic adviser, told the Interfax news agency Thursday. Mr. Illarionov, who is widely viewed as a liberal economic sounding board for President Vladimir V. Putin, said the arrest last month of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the richest of Russia's billionaires, did not reflect selective justice. ''There is no basis to suppose that the use of laws is selective or will be selective,'' Mr. Illarionov said, as reported by Interfax news agency. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin on Thursday cast the arrest of the country's richest man almost two weeks ago as part of a law and order campaign aimed at Russia's hugely wealthy oligarchs. </p> <p> Speaking heatedly at a news conference in Rome, he said: ''People earned billions, I repeat billions, of dollars in the space of five or six years. This would not have been possible in any Western European nation.'' </p> <p> Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky resigned as chief executive of Russia's richest company, Yukos Oil, on Monday even as he defiantly vowed to continue a public -- and possibly a political -- campaign ''to build an open and truly democratic society in Russia.'' </p> <p> Mr. Khodorkovsky, imprisoned since Oct. 25 on charges of embezzlement, fraud and tax evasion, said in a statement that he was stepping aside to shield the company from what he and others have called a politically motivated prosecution. </p> <p> In the two weeks since Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky was arrested and his oil company's assets were impounded in Russia, President Bush and other top American officials have offered little public criticism of what many in the administration acknowledge has been an extremely worrisome development. </p> <p> Instead, administration officials say that Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and some others have raised American concerns in private, avoiding any public comments that might anger President Vladimir V. Putin or jeopardize cooperation on a range of issues. </p> <p> THE battle between President Vladimir V. Putin and a Russian oil tycoon has spread fears that Western companies will shy away from investing in the country's vast energy industry. </p> <p> The good news for the industry is, that probably won't happen. Analysts, economists and investors who follow Russia and its energy sector, the world's largest, say they are not worried that the arrest of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky and the state seizure of his multibillion-dollar stake in Yukos Oil herald an eventual renationalization of the oil industry and a withdrawal of civil liberties and property rights. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin's new chief of staff criticized prosecutors on Sunday for freezing shares in Yukos, the country's largest oil producer, describing the move as potentially reckless and counterproductive. </p> <p> The remarks by the chief of staff, Dmitri A. Medvedev, on state television, appeared to be part of an administration campaign of damage control over the freeze, which was done last week as part of a criminal inquiry. The freeze set off shock waves in Russia's financial markets, pushed Yukos share prices down by a third and raised questions about the country's political and economic direction. </p> <p> In the new Russia, cozy ties to power have been the quickest way to riches. This was a maxim well understood by Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the oil and banking tycoon -- until he landed in jail. </p> <p> Mr. Khodorkovsky was quick, many say ruthless, to seize on the opening of the Russian economy since the Communist days. That propelled him, at 40, to the status of a billionaire, and he became the wealthiest man in Russia. </p> <p> Anton V. Drel arrived at the grim Mastrosskaya Tishina prison here last Saturday and signed the papers declaring him the official counsel of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest tycoon. Then a prosecutor presented Mr. Drel with a summons to be questioned as a witness. </p> <p> ''Even in the Soviet Union, that never happened,'' he said. </p> <p> As foreign oil companies watch the fight unfold over Russia's biggest oil concern, Yukos, they say it confirms what they have known for a decade, once the country embarked on its zigzag path to a market economy: Russia, for all its changes, is not like the West, and it will not be for some time to come. </p> <p> Investors in Russia's stock market may be tempted to scale back significantly. In the arrest of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the chairman of Yukos, and the freezing of much of the company's stock, analysts may see a giant step back to authoritarianism. But international oil companies have been trying to negotiate the shifting attitudes of the Russian government toward foreign investment for years now. </p> <p> Russia's prime minister on Friday criticized the freezing of a large block of shares in the Yukos Oil Company, saying he was ''deeply concerned.'' His statement, which followed a warning from President Vladimir V. Putin against ministerial meddling in the case, verged on open defiance and exposed deepening rifts in the Kremlin. </p> <p> The prime minister, Mikhail M. Kasyanov, is widely considered the most prominent remaining pro-business official in Mr. Putin's government, and his remarks made clear that a free-market faction is arrayed against the ''siloviki,'' or officials drawn from Russia's security forces who favor a stronger role for the state over business. </p> <p> A Russian official threw a scare into an already jittery marketplace on Wednesday, suggesting that licenses to develop the country's natural resources could be reviewed and withdrawn. </p> <p> The official, the minister of natural resources, Vitaly G. Artyukhov, said in a newspaper interview that the oil giant Yukos, whose former chief executive is being held on charges of financial irregularities, could lose the licenses for its oil fields because it was not fulfilling its licensing obligations. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin, in his first comments to Russia's business elite on the arrest of the country's richest man, reiterated Friday that he had no intention of revisiting the controversial privatizations of the 1990's. </p> <p> Top businessmen, meanwhile, publicly distanced themselves from Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the former chief executive of the oil giant Yukos, who was arrested Oct. 25, in an indication that he may be left to his fate in jail while other billionaires continue to enjoy their wealth, wield influence behind the scenes and show public deference to Mr. Putin. </p> <p> Russia and Iran appeared to draw closer on Monday to an agreement that would clear the way for the completion of a nuclear power plant that Russians are building in Iran. </p> <p> On a visit here, Hassan Rowhani, leader of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, said Iran had halted its uranium-enrichment program and was ready to sign a protocol that would be a safeguard against having Iran develop nuclear weapons. </p> <p> A lawyer for the embattled Russian oil tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky said Tuesday that a court in Moscow would decide Nov. 11 whether to release him on bail. Pressure on his company and others continued, with some top executives leaving the country and President Vladimir V. Putin publicly criticizing one businessman. </p> <p> In an interview with Italian journalists on the eve of a visit to Italy, Mr. Putin expressed blunt displeasure about what he called tax evasion that had been practiced by an unidentified executive connected with Mr. Khodorkovsky's company, Yukos Oil. </p> <p> Russia today is ruled by Vladimir Putin's siloviki, former K.G.B. men and military officers who have the nation by the throat. That power-hungry mafia (the Russian word is rooted in ''power'') brooks no opposition from either the small band of democratic reformers or the political leftovers from the Yeltsin regime. </p> <p> Only one power center posed a threat to the siloviki's domination of Russian life. This was the group of oligarchs, who became the super-rich by ripping off the old Soviet Union's natural resources when Communism collapsed. </p> <p> The two fateful questions of Russian history are, ''What is to be done?'' and ''Who is to blame?'' Now, almost four years into the presidency of Vladimir Putin, who came into office asserting that Russia needs a ''dictatorship of law,'' Russians are asking a new question: ''What is to be done with those who are to blame?'' </p> <p> Black humor has long been part of the Russian character, of course. But events of recent weeks have caused this question to be considered with a new seriousness. With the arrest last month of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former chief executive of Russia's largest oil company and Russia's richest man, Mr. Putin has at last given his own answer. </p> <p> A Russian court on Tuesday extended the detention period for Russia's richest man, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, to March 25, well after the scheduled date of Russia's presidential elections. Lawyers for Mr. Khodorkovsky, the former chief of the oil company Yukos, said they would appeal the court's decision. </p> <p> Mr. Khodorkovsky's custody had been scheduled to end on Dec. 30. No date has been set for his trial on charges of fraud, embezzlement and tax evasion. </p> <p> The newly elected Russian Parliament convened Monday and after a quick bit of horse-trading, the bloc supporting President Vladimir V. Putin established a two-thirds majority, which will allow it to pass any laws or make any constitutional changes it wishes. </p> <p> ''Instead of political confrontation, we have before us a constructive Parliament,'' Mr. Putin said, addressing the chamber for the first time since his own election as president four years ago. </p> <p> Russians voted convincingly for a party loyal to President Vladimir V. Putin in parliamentary elections on Sunday, expanding his already dominant political control in the first electoral test of his leadership since he became president nearly four years ago. </p> <p> With 80 percent of the ballots counted by early Monday, United Russia, an alliance of politicians, ministers and businessmen united less by ideology than by their support of Mr. Putin, had collected 36.7 percent of the vote, more than double that of any other party. </p> <p> A suicide bomber set off a devastating explosion inside a crowded commuter train in southern Russia on Friday, killing at least 42 passengers, officials said. President Vladimir V. Putin denounced the bombing as a terrorist act intended to disrupt parliamentary elections here this weekend. </p> <p> The explosion, which occurred at 7:42 a.m., wrenched apart the second carriage of the train only moments after it left the station in Yessentuki, near the foothills of the Caucasus, not far from Chechnya. </p> <p> President Bush on Thursday defended his policy of barring France, Germany, Russia and other nations from $18.6 billion in American-financed Iraqi reconstruction projects. But despite the anger the policy has aroused in foreign capitals, he said his personal envoy, James A. Baker III, would still meet with the leaders of several of those nations to ask that they forgive debts they are owed by Iraq. </p> <p> The president's argument was that only those nations that contributed militarily to the American effort in Iraq should reap the benefits of the $18.6 billion that Congress approved last month for reconstruction. </p> <p> Outside, arctic darkness envelops the mountains, but inside, a video of a bikini-clad Beyoncé blasts on a big screen in this northern Russian mining town, and members of the New Civilization youth movement are discussing their latest project. </p> <p> They are working up an MTV-style public service announcement on the benefits of the Internet. Previously they made an antismoking commercial. </p> <p> A suicide bomber blew herself up outside a historic hotel in the center of Moscow on Tuesday, officials said, killing at least 5 others and seriously wounding 13 several hundred feet from the Kremlin, Red Square and Parliament. </p> <p> The bomb exploded just before 11 on a cold, snowy morning, leaving a scene of chaos and carnage. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin spoke out pre-emptively on Tuesday against those who, he said, hoped to turn the results of the parliamentary elections on Sunday into a mandate to amend Russia's still young Constitution. </p> <p> ''The Constitution has become the basis of stability in society,'' Mr. Putin said in televised remarks to regional lawmakers at the Kremlin. ''And our task is to stop all talk about the necessity of changing the Constitution and to concentrate our attention on something different: how to preserve the Constitution within the framework in which we live.'' </p> <p> By taking over the mass media and seizing the political opposition's source of funds, Vladimir Putin and his K.G.B. cohort have brought back one-party rule to Russia. </p> <p> This week's corrupted Russian election put in place the siloviki -- the hot political word means ''power'' -- and paved the way for Putin's takeover next spring as president-for-life. Russia's short-lived experiment with democracy is all but dead. </p> <p> ''By their mentality and culture, the people of Russia are Europeans,'' President Vladimir V. Putin said in an interview this fall, addressing the centuries-old choice here between East and West. </p> <p> The real question, however, is whether Russia is -- or even wants to be -- part of today's Europe. </p> <p> A senior Kremlin official declared Tuesday that Russia would not ratify the international treaty requiring cuts in the emissions of gases linked to global warming, delivering what could be a fatal blow to years of diplomatic efforts. </p> <p> The official, Andrei N. Illarionov, said in remarks to reporters and in a subsequent interview that President Vladimir V. Putin had told a group of European businessmen on Tuesday that the treaty, known as the Kyoto Protocol, ran counter to Russia's national interests. </p> <p> International observers on Monday criticized Russia's parliamentary elections as a step backward in the country's democratic transition, only moments after President Vladimir V. Putin described them as ''free, honest, open and democratic.'' </p> <p> United Russia, the party defined almost entirely by its fealty to Mr. Putin, swept to overwhelming victory on Sunday after benefiting, the observers said, from fawning coverage on state television and official support at all levels of government. Mr. Putin's party crushed the Communists and ousted all but a handful of liberal democrats from Parliament, capturing the most votes of any party in any election since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. </p> <p> Surprisingly, President Vladimir V. Putin stumbled a bit over several questions during a well-prepared three-hour television call-in program on Thursday. </p> <p> Is he a strict parent? What kind of music does he like? How are his newborn puppies doing? Has he had a tough year? </p> <p> A political party that did not exist in Russia's last election, that offered only the vaguest prescriptions for the country's ills and that did not bother to take part in debates against its rivals appears headed to a resounding victory in the parliamentary race on Sunday on the basis of nothing more -- and nothing less -- than the power and popularity of President Vladimir V. Putin. </p> <p> The party, United Russia, through a coalition with smaller parties and independent lawmakers loyal to Mr. Putin, already controls a slight majority of the 450 seats in Russia's lower house of Parliament, or Duma. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin used a visit on Tuesday by the head of the World Bank to underscore his plans for economic improvements at home, as well as Russia's intention to forgive more debts owed by poor nations. </p> <p> At a meeting here with the bank's president, James D. Wolfensohn, Mr. Putin said Russia wanted to use its higher profile as a World Bank member to illustrate how its economic and financial situation had improved. The bank has given Russia about $8.4 billion in loans since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. </p> <p> Such is the state of politics in Russia today that perhaps the most prominent challenger of Vladimir V. Putin in this year's presidential election accepted his party's nomination with an impassioned endorsement of the incumbent. </p> <p> ''When a leader who is trusted goes into battle, he must not be left alone,'' Sergei M. Mironov, chairman of the upper house of Parliament and leader of the Russian Party of Life, said of Mr. Putin after the party's nominating congress on Sunday. ''One must stand beside him.'' </p> <p> Secretary of State Colin L. Powell sought to assure Russians on Tuesday that despite American plans to redeploy some troops to former Soviet bloc nations in Eastern Europe, the United States had no intention of encircling or threatening their country. </p> <p> Interviewed on a Moscow radio station, Mr. Powell said that while the level of American forces in Europe was falling to fewer than 100,000 from more than 300,000, the Bush administration has been looking at the possibility of putting ''temporary facilities'' in Eastern Europe for training or use as air bases. Forces based in these areas might be sent in emergencies to the Persian Gulf, the Middle East and Central Asia, he said. </p> <p> Secretary of State Colin L. Powell criticized curbs on free elections and the news media, as well as the Russian military campaign in Chechnya, in meetings with the Russian president on Monday and in an essay in a Russian newspaper. His words were the toughest public stance to date by a Bush administration official. </p> <p> ''Certain developments in Russian politics and foreign policy in recent months have given us pause,'' Mr. Powell said in his essay, published Monday in the newspaper Izvestia. Mr. Powell said he raised those concerns in seven hours of meetings with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, and other officials at the Kremlin. </p> <p> A Moscow court rejected an appeal on Thursday by the jailed Russian oil tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky that he be freed on bail pending trial. No court date has been set. </p> <p> The Moscow City Court's ruling upheld a decision by a lower court and said that Mr. Khodorkovsky must remain jailed until at least March 25, with many more extensions possible. Thus Russia's richest man will remain behind bars through the March 14 presidential elections, which the highly popular incumbent Vladimir V. Putin is expected to sweep. </p> <p> What passes for Russia's presidential contest is progressing smartly. </p> <p> One candidate has been refused a spot on the ballot, while two others, both businessmen, abruptly withdrew this week with as little fanfare -- and clear explanation -- as when they entered the race. </p> <p> Yukos, Russia's biggest oil company, dug in its heels on Thursday in its long, bitter dispute with a smaller rival, Sibneft. The Yukos board said Thursday that it would recommend that the company's management resume merger talks. The board also said that it had hired Squire, Sanders & Dempsey as a legal adviser and J.P. Morgan, the investment banking unit of J.P. Morgan Chase, as bankers and financial consultants. </p> <p> Yukos sealed a $13 billion deal to acquire Sibneft last year, but after Yukos' chief executive, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, was jailed Oct. 25, Sibneft called off the merger in November. The two sides have been fighting over a resolution since. </p> <p> The collision between Russia's most powerful politician, President Vladimir V. Putin, and its richest businessman, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, had been brewing for months when Mr. Khodorkovsky took the step that more than any other landed him in prison -- trying to sell a major stake in his oil company, Yukos, to ExxonMobil. </p> <p> As recounted by associates and analysts, Mr. Khodorkovsky failed to consult the Kremlin adequately about a deal that would cede substantial control over a strategic Russian resource to a foreign company, and an American one at that. </p> <p> The Russian Parliament on Thursday unexpectedly scheduled a vote this month on a long-ignored bill that would extend the presidential term to seven years, even though President Vladimir V. Putin has publicly opposed such constitutional changes. </p> <p> The legislation was introduced by a group of regional lawmakers in 2002 but languished. As written, it could allow Mr. Putin to run for two new terms, conceivably keeping him in power until 2018. </p> <p> The mystery over the disappearance of a presidential candidate deepened Monday. </p> <p> Moscow's prosecutor's office announced that it had opened a murder investigation in the case of the candidate, Ivan P. Rybkin, only to have federal prosecutors overrule them and close the case within an hour, saying there was no evidence yet to suggest foul play. </p> <p> The Moscow Metro was packed once again on Monday, the first workday after an explosion on a subway car took at least 40 lives on Friday in what officials now say was a suicide bombing. </p> <p> But the atmosphere was not business as usual, as flags around the city flew at half-staff, a pile of red carnations sat on a subway platform near the site of the blast and officials warned of more attacks to come. </p> <p> A small bomb exploded on Monday outside the apartment of a journalist who has created a political sensation with a behind-the-scenes account of the Kremlin during President Vladimir V. Putin's rise to power. </p> <p> The journalist, Yelena Tregubova, was not injured, but she said in an interview that she feared that the bombing was an attempt on her life. The bomb exploded moments before she left her apartment for a taxi that was waiting downstairs, she said. </p> <p> This city is no longer the venue of appeasement. </p> <p> At an annual security conference here on the eve of NATO's seven-state expansion, Moscow's neo-imperialist defense minister threatened to back out of an agreement limiting the size of his armed forces on Russia's European front. </p> <p> One of Vladimir V. Putin's challengers in the presidential election next month is missing, and the police and security services announced Sunday that they had begun a search for him. </p> <p> Ivan P. Rybkin, a former Parliament speaker and national security adviser under Boris N. Yeltsin, has not been seen or heard from since Thursday evening, raising fears among his family and campaign aides that something dire has happened to him. </p> <p> It was a few minutes before 5 on a recent night and the deadline was approaching for the nightly news of the Russian state. The anchor of Vesti, Mikhail Antonov, still without makeup, his hair tousled, had to decide whether to trim the report on protests in Latvia or a train wreck in Chicago. </p> <p> It was out of the question to trim what almost always tops the news, whether interesting or not. ''If there is no obvious breaking news, we start with the president,'' said Mr. Antonov, whose program appears on the state channel Rossiya, or Russia. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin abruptly dismissed Russia's prime minister and his cabinet on Tuesday, announcing that he would appoint a new government in a surprise shuffling of ministers on the eve of an election Mr. Putin is sure to win. </p> <p> Mr. Putin, who announced his decision in a brief, emotionless address on state television, did not directly criticize the work of the prime minister, Mikhail M. Kasyanov, but said the country's voters deserved to know the shape of the new government before casting their ballots on March 14. But Mr. Putin did not explain exactly what shape the new government would take. Nor did he make any immediate announcement of a replacement, though he did install one of Mr. Kasyanov's deputies, Viktor B. Khristenko, as acting prime minister. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin oversaw one of Russia's largest strategic military exercises in years for a second day on Wednesday, and, for a second day, something went wrong. </p> <p> An intercontinental ballistic missile fired from the nuclear submarine Karelia in the Barents Sea veered wildly off course 98 seconds after the launching and self-destructed, a navy spokesman, Capt. Igor V. Dygalo, said. The cause of the malfunction, he said, would be investigated. </p> <p> A bomb exploded inside a crowded subway train during the morning rush on Friday, killing at least 39 people and wounding more than 130. No one claimed responsibility for the bombing though senior government officials, including President Vladimir V. Putin, said they suspected that it was the latest in a series of terrorist attacks linked to the war in Chechnya. </p> <p> The bomb, said to have been hidden in a backpack or bag, ravaged the second car of the train as it left the Avtozavodskaya station in southeast Moscow and headed toward the city's center at 8:45 a.m. The blast shattered the train's windows, rent its metal seats and bars and hurled bodies and body parts from the train. </p> <p> BORING! More questions about her personal life. More questions about this unusual creature, a glamorous, sharp-tongued half-Japanese woman who is making a lot of noise about being president. </p> <p> She dropped her chin emphatically onto her hand with a look of mock exasperation. There was a challenge in her eyes and a bit of fun too. There is no shilly-shallying around Irina M. Khakamada. This is a 48-year-old woman who tried three husbands before she found the one she liked. </p> <p> Vladimir Putin, who will be handily re-elected president of Russia today, is never going to become a Western-style, liberal-democratic politician, no matter how much we wish it. He is a quintessentially Russian leader, with very traditional aspirations and interests, and until the West gets used to it, he will continue to be a tantalizing source of frustration and disappointment. </p> <p> When Mr. Putin diverges from the democratic path -- as when he abruptly dismissed his prime minister and entire cabinet last month -- Western observers tend to either criticize his authoritarianism or simply declare him ''an enigma'' (the traditional cop-out for pundits when they do not understand Russian leaders). And we pose the familiar questions: is Mr. Putin a reformer or a hard-liner? Is he his own man or is he controlled by the dreaded siloviki, the former security officials who have become the powers in the Kremlin? Was it the president or the siloviki who arrested the oil mogul Mikhail Khodorkovsky, seized control of the news media from private owners, purged and re-purged the benighted dystopia of Chechnya? </p> <p> The Central Intelligence Agency is warning of a ''greater assertiveness'' on the part of Russia if President Vladimir V. Putin wins re-election as expected on Sunday. </p> <p> A new C.I.A. assessment made public this week says that assertiveness by Russia is likely to be evident both at home and abroad, with its tough stance in the war on Chechnya unlikely to soften and with a more robust approach toward neighboring countries like Georgia and Ukraine backed up by the increasing stakes taken by Russian companies in those countries' energy industries. </p> <p> Even by Russian standards of democracy, it was a little much to refuse to let patients check into the hospital unless they could prove they had their absentee ballots for Sunday's presidential election. </p> <p> That is what the health committee in Khabarovsk in Russia's Far East ordered beginning March 1 to try to increase voter turnout, about the only drama in an election that President Vladimir V. Putin is all but certain to win. </p> <p> This city and the rest of Russia will vote in presidential elections tomorrow, but most Westerners would be baffled by the campaign that has led up to the voting. In his re-election bid, President Vladimir Putin refused to participate in any debates, make any policy statements, respond to his few timid detractors or explain his plans for Russia's future. </p> <p> And Russians think that's just fine. ''An election campaign? What for?'' said Stepan Kirichiuk, 54, who is the mayor of Tyumen, the capital of Western Siberia. </p> <p> Although most independent observers agree that last week's presidential election in Russia was unfair, there is little doubt that Vladimir V. Putin would have won re-election by a landslide even in an honest election. That's because a campaign slogan used to great effect in America 12 years ago -- ''It's the economy, stupid'' -- also holds true in Russia. </p> <p> An economic record similar to Mr. Putin's would assure the incumbent's re-election in almost any democratic country. By almost any measure, the record is outstanding. </p> <p> There is almost no sign of a presidential election campaign here in the Russian heartland, but apparently there is very little desire for one. </p> <p> From shoemaker to shopkeeper to hunter to teacher, it seems that almost everyone is backing the same candidate, the incumbent president, Vladimir V. Putin. </p> <p> This one-minute television advertisement is the longest of four versions produced for Ivan P. Rybkin, a former speaker of Parliament and national security adviser under Boris N. Yeltsin. </p> <p> PRODUCER -- A spokeswoman for Mr. Rybkin refused to identify the company that produced the advertisement, saying that the company feared retaliation. Mr. Rybkin's campaign, and presumably his advertising campaign, has been largely financed by Boris A. Berezovsky, the self-exiled tycoon who is one of Mr. Putin's fiercest critics. </p> <p> Four days after his unexpected appointment, Mikhail Y. Fradkov was approved as prime minister by the Russian Parliament on Friday, following little debate and only a cursory discussion of his policy goals. </p> <p> Mr. Fradkov, a long-serving technocrat plucked from political obscurity by President Vladimir V. Putin on Monday to lead the government, promised that he would streamline state services and agencies, enforce laws against corruption and tax evasion, and restructure an economy still heavily reliant on natural resources. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin cruised to a second term on Sunday in an election that had never been in doubt and that consolidated his centralized control of power in Russia. </p> <p> Mr. Putin, 51, had already taken command of Parliament in an election in December and marginalized his opponents by limiting press access and harassing their campaigns. Last week, he effectively began his second term by appointing a new cabinet. </p> <p> Russia's democracy may well be faltering, but its elections still allow the ultimate protest vote: ''against all.'' In most races it attracts a few percent of contrary votes. Here in this faded industrial city on the Volga, it won. Twice. </p> <p> In the December parliamentary election, voters of District 181 threw out not only the incumbent, a retired general, but the rest of the pack as well. ''Against all,'' the box at the bottom of the ballot, received nearly 20 percent of the votes, more than double what any of the 14 actual candidates won. </p> <p> Nothing, it seems, can stop the Russian stock market. </p> <p> Russia's sources of wealth -- oil, gas, gold and other metals -- are fetching lofty prices and helping power what the country's finance minister recently warned could be a stock market bubble. The market was up 57 percent in 2003. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin surprised Russia on Monday by picking a low-profile technocrat as prime minister, a position that answers directly to the president. </p> <p> The appointee, Mikhail Y. Fradkov, 53, has held a number of mostly economic portfolios, including chief of the tax police, and was most recently Russia's representative to the European Union. </p> <p> Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the jailed Russian oil tycoon, published a long treatise on Monday lamenting the decline of liberal democracy here while acknowledging the part he and other business leaders played in the process during the tumultuous years after the collapse of the Soviet Union. </p> <p> Making his most extensive public remarks since his arrest in October, Mr. Khodorkovsky also wrote in the newspaper Vedomosti that Russia's largest companies needed to recognize President Vladimir V. Putin's political authority generally and to accept higher taxes on natural resources specifically in order to legitimize the privatization deals of the 1990's. </p> <p> International election observers on Monday criticized Russia's presidential election for falling short of basic democratic standards, even as President Vladimir V. Putin accepted congratulatory telephone calls from presidents and prime ministers of the world's leading democracies. </p> <p> The observers -- representing the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe -- cited the misuse of government resources, bias in state news media and even instances of ballot stuffing on Election Day. </p> <p> The Russian Parliament took the first step on Wednesday toward passing a law that would ban demonstrations in most public places, narrowing one of the crucial freedoms won as the Soviet Union came to an end. </p> <p> The bill passed the first of three readings by a vote of 294 to 137, reflecting the dominance of supporters of President Vladimir V. Putin, who also won an overwhelming majority of votes when he was re-elected on March 14. </p> <p> A Moscow court sentenced a Russian scientist on Wednesday to 15 years at hard labor for spying for the United States in a case that rights groups said harked back to Soviet-style repression. </p> <p> Igor Sutyagin, 39, an arms control expert, was found guilty of espionage on Monday for selling information to a foreign company that he and fellow scientists said was unclassified and open to the public. </p> <p> Tanya Lokshina, a leading human rights campaigner, gathered her staff together some months ago and told them what to do if they were visited by the secret police. </p> <p> Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, had just been arrested by masked police shouting, ''Everyone on the floor or we'll shoot!'' Among the civic organizations he helped support was Ms. Lokshina's group, the Moscow Helsinki Group. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin said Thursday that he hoped the expansion of NATO might have a positive effect on international relations but that the expansion is not effective against terrorist threats. </p> <p> ''Life shows that simply expanding will not enable us to effectively counter the main threats that we are facing today,'' he told Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, the NATO secretary general, at a Kremlin meeting. </p> <p> A bomb exploded in a stadium in Chechnya's capital on Sunday, killing the republic's president and delivering a severe blow to President Vladimir V. Putin's efforts to end the long, deadly conflict in the region. </p> <p> As many as 13 others were killed, two officials there said, while more than 50 were reported wounded, including the Russian military commander for the region. There was no immediate claim of responsiblity. </p> <p> Russia's largest hydroelectric dam harnesses the great Yenisei River here where the Sayan Mountains melt into Siberian steppe. </p> <p> It was once a showcase of Soviet engineering prowess, then of an emerging free market, generating power for a vast region that stretches 3,000 miles from Omsk to Chita. It is now the subject of a legal struggle at the shadowy intersection where power, property and politics in Russia collide. </p> <p> Vladimir V. Putin inaugurated his second term as president on Friday with a pledge to give Russians ''a real, tangible increase in their prosperity'' and to nurture political and social freedoms that his critics say he has gradually eroded. </p> <p> ''Only free people in a free country can be genuinely successful,'' Mr. Putin said in a brief speech at the Kremlin after taking the oath of office, his right hand on a red-bound copy of the Russian Constitution. ''This is the foundation for economic growth and political stability in Russia.'' </p> <p> The assassination of the Russian-backed president of Chechnya on Sunday has left the Kremlin with few good options in pursuing a brutal and thankless war that has continued on and off for almost a decade. </p> <p> The president, Akhmad Kadyrov, 52, was buried Monday in his home village in southeastern Chechnya just seven months after being elected in a stage-managed vote that was intended to demonstrate that the war had become a manageable, localized conflict. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin said Wednesday that foreign ''political, economic and media pressure'' was being used in an attempt to weaken Russia's chances of competing globally. </p> <p> In a televised state of the nation speech -- his first since his re-election by an overwhelming majority in March -- Mr. Putin singled out private groups in Russia that he said claimed to support the welfare of the people but were in fact serving other foreign and domestic masters for pay. </p> <p> In a rare visit to a war zone that has become Russia's quagmire, President Vladimir V. Putin made a quick trip on Tuesday to Chechnya, and said its bombed and battered capital, Grozny, looked ''horrible.'' </p> <p> His visit, two days after the assassination of his hand-picked president for the region, Akhmad Kadyrov, was an acknowledgment that the conflict from which he has tried to distance himself remained a critical problem for the Kremlin. </p> <p> The victors and the vanquished came together on the Norman coast on Sunday to commemorate the Allied landing exactly 60 years ago that breached Hitler's defended sea wall and led to Europe's liberation. </p> <p> Ceremonies spanning 50 miles of battle sites evoked a war with a crystal clear purpose, when invaders were liberators, when an occupied France embraced the Americans and their allies with gratitude and glee. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin said Friday that Russia gave intelligence reports to the Bush administration suggesting that Saddam Hussein's government was preparing terrorist attacks in the United States or against American targets overseas. </p> <p> But officials at the State Department expressed surprise, saying they knew of no such information from Russia, Reuters reported. </p> <p> Surrounded by world leaders who sounded eager to put their bitter divisions on Iraq behind them, President Bush on Tuesday welcomed the adoption of a Security Council resolution on Iraq and said the nation was solidly on the road to democracy. </p> <p> ''The vote today in the United Nations Security Council was a great victory for the Iraqi people,'' Mr. Bush said as he sat with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at this seaside resort off the Georgia coast, which has been sealed off for summit talks that began here Tuesday night. ''The international community showed that it stands side by side with the Iraqi people.'' </p> <p> BETWEEN DICTATORSHIP AND DEMOCRACY  Russian Post-Communist Political Reform  By Michael McFaul, Nikolai Petrov and Andrei Ryabov  364 pages. Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. $50, hardback; $24.95, paperback. </p> <p> Even though post-Communist Russia is no longer a superpower, its fate remains of great concern to the rest of the world if only because its location in the heartland of the global land mass directly affects three major regions: Europe, the Middle East and the Far East. ''Between Dictatorship and Democracy,'' sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, addresses the question of whether Russia is moving toward democracy and openness or reverting again to its autocratic traditions. </p> <p> One of Russia's most outspoken television broadcasters has been fired after he aired a program against the wishes of the government and then objected angrily when the broadcast was abruptly halted. </p> <p> The firing of the broadcaster, Leonid Parfyonov, announced Tuesday night, appears to be the latest step by President Vladimir V. Putin in tightening control over the news media as well as other areas of public life. </p> <p> A day before an expected court ruling that could cost the Russian oil giant Yukos billions of dollars in back taxes, President Vladimir V. Putin said on Thursday that his government would do its best to assure that the company would not go bankrupt. </p> <p> ''Russian authorities, the government, and the economic officials of our country are not interested in seeing Yukos go bankrupt,'' Mr. Putin told reporters during a regional leadership meeting in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan. </p> <p> Only weeks into a second term that President Vladimir V. Putin captured in part because he seemed to embody the welcome possibility of stability, his government has moved to dismantle a robust vestige of Soviet times: an array of social benefits that many Russians regard as essential. </p> <p> In a bill introduced in the lower house of Parliament, the Duma, Mr. Putin's government has proposed replacing subsidized services -- free public transportation, low-cost electricity, free medicine for invalids and rent-free apartments for many government workers -- with cash stipends of $20 to $120 a month. </p> <p> ''They did not know how to judge and could not agree what to consider evil and what good; they did not know whom to blame, whom to justify.'' </p> <p> -- Dostoevsky, ''Crime and Punishment'' </p> <p> SINCE his incarceration eight months ago, Russia's richest man, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, has made only fleeting public appearances -- behind bars on a prison video screen, hustled from police vans amid a phalanx of security guards, or, as his trial began on Wednesday in a Moscow courtroom, seated inside a cage. </p> <p> An audacious overnight raid by heavily armed militants in a southern Russian republic neighboring Chechnya killed at least 75 people and wounded dozens more before the fighters withdrew with minimal losses and a cache of captured weapons, officials said Tuesday. </p> <p> The raid, which began late Monday night with attacks against police and security posts across the republic of Ingushetia, was concentrated in the principal city, Nazran. It was the largest attack by Chechnya's separatist rebels outside Chechnya since 1999, and it appeared to catch police and security officers in the region off guard and ill prepared. </p> <p> The leading candidate for the presidency of Chechnya emerged Tuesday when President Vladimir V. Putin signaled support for Maj. Gen. Alu Alkhanov, the Russian republic's top police official, a man who until now was little known to the public. </p> <p> In an appearance at the Kremlin, General Alu Alkhanov, the interior minister of Chechnya, sat with Mr. Putin and said he would campaign for the office left vacant by the assassination last month of the president, Akhmad Kadyrov. </p> <p> When Russia's Communist Party convened what might have been its grand party congress this weekend, the setting could hardly have been more bleak. The concert hall booked for the occasion was nearly half empty. And somehow -- the leadership called it sabotage -- there was no electricity. </p> <p> Minutes after the singing of Russia's national anthem, even the emergency lights went out. </p> <p> Two faces of Russian oil emerged on Friday, as a consortium in London offered to pay the $3.4 billion tax bill of the embattled Yukos Oil as part of an effort to acquire a stake in the company, while elsewhere the government gave strong indications of favoring ConocoPhillips as a buyer for Russia's stake in Lukoil. </p> <p> The London consortium -- made up of Konstantin Kagalovsky, a Yukos shareholder; George Miller, a businessman based in Kent, England; and a small number of private investors -- offered to buy the Russian oil giant's assets and pay the company's taxes and debt, totaling $10 billion to $12 billion. Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the company's founder, has been in jail since October, facing charges of fraud and embezzlement. </p> <p> Moving to quell a feud for control of the Russian military and simultaneously reacting to a stinging military setback last month near Chechnya, President Vladimir V. Putin on Monday dismissed four senior military and security officers. </p> <p> Mr. Putin has rarely wanted for a dramatic gesture, and the dismissals demonstrated that point once more. Gen. Anatoly Kvashnin, the chief of Russia's general staff, a rough equivalent of the Pentagon's chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, topped the list of those dismissed. </p> <p> Spelling out some details of its proposal to settle its tax debt with the government, the Russian oil giant Yukos said on Sunday that it had offered to pay $8 billion in back taxes for the years 2000 to 2003, as long as it could have three years to make the payments. </p> <p> The Interfax news agency said that the offer was the same one made to the government by Yukos's chief executive, Steven M. Theede, on Thursday. </p> <p> A court in Qatar convicted two Russian secret agents on Wednesday in the murder of a former president of Chechnya in the Persian Gulf, a killing that the presiding judge said had been ordered by the Russian government. </p> <p> In his statement, the Qatari judge, Ibrahim Saleh al-Nisf, for the first time publicly accused senior Russian officials of orchestrating the killing of Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, a Chechen rebel leader in exile who died in February when a bomb exploded in his Land Cruiser as he left a mosque in Qatar's capital, Doha. </p> <p> Pity, if you can, the richest man in Russia. With a fortune estimated at $15 billion, Mikhail Khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud, embezzlement and tax evasion and faces a 10-year jail term. His oil company, Yukos, has been hit with a tax bill of $3.4 billion, and the government is threatening to seize its most valuable assets. Although many nations, including America, tend to err on the side of courtesy to wealthy defendants, Russia does not: denied bail since his arrest in October, Khodorkovsky has not been allowed to prepare for trial from the comfort of one of his mansions, and when he is brought to court, he is placed in a metal cage. </p> <p> In today's Russia, wealth attracts trouble. President Vladimir Putin, eager to punish billionaires who oppose his rule, has chosen to make an example of Khodorkovsky, though Khodorkovsky is not the first to face Putin's selective wrath. Not long ago, Boris Berezovsky, a billionaire power broker in Moscow in the 1990's, chose exile in London to the metal cage that might have been his fate if he stayed in Russia. Vladimir Gusinsky, a media baron, was next up: forced to sell his empire at fire-sale prices, Gusinsky must now content himself with exile in Israel. </p> <p> Under heavy security and with few voters visible in this hushed capital, the Russian republic of Chechnya held a special election on Sunday to select a successor for its assassinated president. </p> <p> Although no winner was declared Sunday night, all signs pointed to victory for the Kremlin-backed candidate, Maj. Gen. Alu Alkhanov, the republic's interior minister, who had been endorsed by Vladimir V. Putin, Russia's president. </p> <p> As she prepared to swing the wire and ball of the hammer throw, Yelena Konevstova gestured to the tattered backstop where she stood and warned: ''You better not stand here. There are holes in the net.'' </p> <p> She swung the hammer around her head before whirling and hurling it toward her trainer on the far side of a weedy lot, where broken sticks marked her previous efforts. This field, like most of the buildings here at the Podolsk Sportbaza, one of Russia's principal Olympic training centers, just south of Moscow, shows the disrepair typical of post-Soviet Russia and its once-vaunted state sports machine. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin flew to Chechnya for a rare visit on Sunday after a night of fierce rebel attacks in the republic that, according to official Russian accounts, killed at least 30 people, including 12 federal and local security officers. </p> <p> Mr. Putin's trip, along with the fighting, came a week before Chechnya is to hold an election to replace Akhmad Kadyrov, the president of the Chechen republic who was killed in a bombing in May. Both events appeared intended to influence the outcome of the vote, another ambiguous milestone in the long, violent conflict there. </p> <p> The woman in the market hurriedly packed away the shampoo and perfume she usually sells. The stalls were almost abandoned. She was in a rush to leave and escape the capital's brooding air. </p> <p> ''Tomorrow I will go to a village,'' she said. ''I will not stay and vote.'' </p> <p> Two Russian passenger jets on domestic flights crashed nearly simultaneously after departing from the same terminal in Moscow on Tuesday night, officials said. At least 88 people were presumed dead. </p> <p> While precise details surrounding the crashes were unclear, the Russian new service Interfax, citing an anonymous official source, reported that minutes after the first plane went down, the second jet issued a distress signal indicating it had been hijacked. Then it, too, disappeared from radar. </p> <p> Yukos, the Russian oil giant, suffered another setback on Monday when a court refroze shares in the company's main oil-producing subsidiary. </p> <p> The Moscow Arbitration Court reversed a short-lived victory it gave Yukos on Friday, when it overturned bailiffs' seizure of Yuganskneftegas, a unit that accounts for 60 percent of the company's output. But on Monday, the unit's shares were seized again after the Justice Ministry won an appeal it filed Friday, citing Yukos's ''lack of cash'' and its inability to pay a $3.4 billion back tax bill for 2000. </p> <p> You say that we are winning in Iraq. Senator Chuck Hagel, a Republican, says, ''We're in deep trouble.'' Gen. John P. Abizaid is asking for more troops. Secretary of State Colin Powell admits the insurgency is getting worse. The C.I.A. is pessimistic. Billions of dollars that were earmarked for reconstruction have been diverted for security. Insurgent attacks have quadrupled. Deaths of coalition troops are up. Significant chunks of Iraq are under enemy control. You have no viable military plan to make sure the January elections proceed peacefully and no political plan to reconcile competing factions. Your argument for re-election is that this is too dangerous a time to change direction. But since the direction is obviously wrong, don't we at least need to change drivers? </p> <p> How has the Iraq war made us safer, if it transformed Iraq from a place whose military was surrounded and contained, into what you have repeatedly called the ''central front'' in the war on terror? </p> <p> Tens of thousands of people massed near Red Square on Tuesday to mourn the slain children of Beslan, while President Vladimir V. Putin vented his anger at their killers and, in unusually strong terms, at critics who call for a moderate response. </p> <p> ''Hands off our children'' read a banner in the huge, packed crowd, voicing what seemed to be a universal sentiment that even in the vicious world of terrorism there must be a limit to cruelty. </p> <p> Liliya Boyalova came to work on Wednesday resolved to be stoic. But as she sold lottery tickets inside the bustling Paveletskaya subway station here, she felt only anxiety and fear. </p> <p> Her neighbor in Moscow was among those wounded the night before, when a suicide bomber blew herself up outside a subway station across the city, killing at least 10 others and wounding 50. </p> <p> Heavily armed insurgents, some with explosives strapped to their bodies, seized a school here in southern Russia on Wednesday, herded scores of schoolchildren, parents and teachers into its gymnasium and threatened to kill them. </p> <p> More than a dozen guerrillas, including men and women, stormed Middle School No.1 in this town in North Ossetia, not far from Chechnya on Russia's southern border with Georgia, as children lined up outside the building just moments after the opening of the school year. Estimates of the number of hostages ranged from 120 to more than 300. </p> <p> As lawmakers here debated how to respond to terrorist attacks, Russian investigators on Wednesday arrested an airport police supervisor who briefly detained two women suspected of killing themselves and 88 others aboard two passenger airliners last month, the Prosecutor General's Office said. </p> <p> The officer, Capt. Mikhail Artamonov, has already lost his job overseeing counterterrorism activities at Domodedovo International Airport outside Moscow. He now faces criminal charges for failure to take a simple action that may have prevented the country's worst act of terrorism in the air, a spokesman for the office said in a telephone interview. </p> <p> In an unusual retreat under public pressure, President Vladimir V. Putin on Friday promised an open inquiry into the recent slaughter of hundreds of hostages in a schoolhouse, although the forum he chose left critics doubtful of his good faith. </p> <p> After insisting that only a closed internal inquiry would be held, Mr. Putin said Friday that the upper house of Parliament would begin an inquiry on Sept. 20 to provide ''a full and objective picture of all the tragic events linked with the hostage-taking.'' His brief announcement on television came as public anguish continued and questions multiplied about the events in which more than 300 people died in the southern town of Beslan, nearly half of them children. </p> <p> Following is a transcript of President Vladimir V. Putin's televised remarks at the Kremlin on Saturday night, as translated by The New York Times: </p> <p> It is a difficult and bitter task for me to speak. A horrible tragedy happened in our land. During these last few days, each one of us suffered immensely, having all that happened in the Russian city of Beslan run through our hearts. We were confronted not just by murderers, but those who used their weapons against defenseless children. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin broke his two-day silence on the wrenching siege of Middle School No.1 when he flew Saturday to Beslan, a small city in southern Russia, but his first public remarks -- ''Today all Russia suffers for you'' -- made briefly, before dawn, were addressed to the region's president and leaders of its security agencies, not to those who suffered most. </p> <p> His remarks and the orders he issued -- to close the region's borders, to find the terrorists involved, to organize assistance for the victims -- were meant to project, again, Mr. Putin's carefully cultivated image as the steely, decisive leader of a country in need. He spoke again from the Kremlin hours later, making a rare national address that included an ever rarer acknowledgement of Russia's weakness in fighting terror, even as he again vowed resoluteness after what he called ''an attack on all of us.'' </p> <p> In a rare address to his nation, coming at a time of grave crisis, President Vladimir V. Putin said Saturday that the school siege in the southern city of Beslan was an attack on all of Russia and called for the mobilization of society to resist what he called ''a total and full-scale war'' to splinter the country. </p> <p> Mr. Putin spoke as the death toll from the violent end of the hostage crisis at Middle School No. 1 in Beslan rose to 330; half of the dead were children. Officials warned that the number of dead would rise further in the city, not far from Chechnya, as workers searched the school's charred wreckage and as more victims succumbed to their wounds in hospitals. </p> <p> If there has been a consensus on Vladimir V. Putin's presidency, it is about stability. He has brought stability, the consensus goes, to Russia's economy, its foreign policy, to its politics. If the cost of stability has been aspects of authoritarianism, then that is a price most, here and abroad, have been willing to pay. </p> <p> But in recent weeks, there have been signs that Mr. Putin's reputation for stability has, if not exactly crumbled, then at least cracked a bit. </p> <p> The government on Tuesday stepped up diplomatic efforts to win the release of two French journalists taken hostage in Iraq as the deadline set by their kidnappers passed with no word of the hostages' fate. </p> <p> But it continued to refuse to give in to the kidnappers' demand that it rescind a new law banning Islamic head scarves and other ''conspicuous'' religious symbols from public schools. </p> <p> As grief begins to mutate into anger two weeks after the mass killings in Beslan, this drab little town not far away waits in fear for possible reprisals. </p> <p> The people here are ethnic Ingush. The victims of the killings were mostly Ossetians. The feuds and hatreds between the groups go back too far to calculate. </p> <p> A Russian colonel who was incarcerated last year in the March 2000 murder of a Chechen woman has been recommended for pardon by a regional amnesty commission that convened at the prison where he was serving a 10-year term, according to news reports on Friday. </p> <p> The decision to recommend a pardon for the officer, Col. Yuri D. Budanov, was made Wednesday, Anatoly Zherebtsov, the leader of the Ulyanovsk Oblast commission, told the Interfax news agency. The commission also decided to restore Colonel Budanov's military rank and decorations, of which he had been stripped. It was not clear why the decision was not announced immediately. </p> <p> Secretary of State Colin L. Powell expressed concern on Tuesday over President Vladimir V. Putin's recent action to consolidate his power in Russia, declaring that Mr. Putin was ''pulling back'' on democratic reforms in the name of fighting terrorism. </p> <p> In guarded comments that nonetheless amounted to the most explicit criticism of Mr. Putin by the Bush administration in some time and were more critical than the initial White House statement on Monday that his actions were an internal Russian matter, Mr. Powell said he intended to take up the administration's concerns in meetings with Russian leaders, perhaps with Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at the United Nations next week. </p> <p> On Monday, President Vladimir V. Putin announced he would strip Russia's 89 regions of much of their authority and electoral legitimacy. On Tuesday, not one of the leaders of those regions said a public word of protest. </p> <p> On the contrary, there were words of praise. </p> <p> The Russian natural gas giant Gazprom said on Tuesday that it would buy one of the country's top oil companies, a move that would create a state-owned energy juggernaut. </p> <p> In an indication of just how closely the Kremlin is now shepherding Russia's energy riches, Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, said Tuesday that he personally backed a proposal that Gazprom, the country's No.1 gas concern, swap some of its shares for Rosneft, the country's No.5 oil company. </p> <p> ''We ride on the subway and think it is for the last time,'' the Rev. Aleksandr Borisov told Russian Orthodox worshipers on Sunday morning. ''We gather in a church and think it is our last liturgy.'' </p> <p> This was not simply the homily of a Sunday sermon. Following one of the most horrific terrorist acts in recent times, with the massacre of hundreds of children, parents and teachers in a schoolhouse on Friday, Father Borisov said he was speaking quite literally. </p> <p> The siege of a school here in southern Russia ended Friday in panic, violence and death 52 hours after it began. At least 250 people -- most of them students, teachers and parents -- died, according to official reports and witnesses, after two large explosions set off pitched battles between heavily armed captors and Russian forces that continued for hours. </p> <p> Ambulances, police cars and any other free vehicle rushed as many as 700 people to hospitals in frenzied convoys that careered through the streets of this small, leafy city in the republic of North Ossetia. </p> <p> During one of Russia's most searing hostage crises, one that struck fear across the country and made news around the world, the country's three largest television networks hesitated, then flailed, and finally turned away. </p> <p> Even as pandemonium broke out in Beslan, the state-owned or controlled networks avoided the bloodiest images of an assault that left scores dead, many of them schoolchildren. The two largest and most watched --Channel One and Rossiya -- offered brief updates, but continued with their regular afternoon programming. </p> <p> Every day for the past two weeks, Zema Godzhiyeva has forced herself to hope, examining the charred bodies in the morgue in search of her 14-year-old son, Roman. </p> <p> Every time she fails, she said, it seems that her child has died again and day by day she feels that she is dying along with him. </p> <p> A Russian Army colonel convicted of murdering a Chechen woman in 2000 has withdrawn his application for a pardon, the Russian news media reported Tuesday. </p> <p> There was no indication why Col. Yuri Budanov had withdrawn his appeal -- he canceled a similar application in May -- but the move lifts a political burden from President Vladimir V. Putin, who would have had to make the final decision in the controversial case. </p> <p> The Kremlin reorganized its local security services on Thursday in the region where hundreds of people were killed last week in a school hostage-taking, the first public step in a program of heightened security announced earlier by President Vladimir V. Putin. </p> <p> The minister of transport said that tighter security measures were being prepared for airports and that special ''search groups'' had already been organized. </p> <p> On Monday, against the backdrop of the terrorist attack in Beslan, President Vladimir Putin of Russia held a remarkable four-hour discussion with a small group of American and Western European journalists and analysts at his official residence at Novo-Ogaryovo, outside Moscow. The meeting had been scheduled as part of a two-day conference on Russian-Western relations, but given the unfolding horrors at School No. 1, we were certain it would be canceled. Instead, President Putin turned it into a very personal exercise in public diplomacy. </p> <p> Why did he meet with a group of foreigners at this critical juncture? Clearly, he was sending a message that he needs the United States and Europe to pay careful attention as he responds to the massacre. More specifically, he was saying three things: first, the situation in the North Caucasus is no longer just about Chechnya but involves dozens of potential ethnic and religious conflicts across the region; second, the West must stop simply criticizing me for the war in Chechnya without offering me any realistic solutions; and third, some things you are doing are making it much more difficult for me to resolve the situation. </p> <p> The terrorist attack in Beslan in Russia's North Caucasus was not only bloody but viciously sadistic: the children taken hostage by pro-Chechen terrorists were denied food and drink and even forbidden to go to the bathroom, then massacred when the siege was broken. It is proper for the civilized world to express outrage and feel solidarity with the Russian people. But to say this is not necessarily to agree with those -- including President Bush and President Vladimir Putin of Russia -- who would equate the massacre with the 9/11 attacks and Islamic terrorism in general. </p> <p> In his post-Beslan speech, Mr. Putin all but linked the attack to global Islam: ''We have to admit that we have failed to recognize the complexity and dangerous nature of the processes taking place in our own country and the world in general.'' Reports that some of the terrorists were Arabs reinforce that line of thinking. But the fact is, the Chechen cause and that of Al Qaeda are quite different, and demand very different approaches in combating them. </p> <p> The Russian government offered a $10 million reward Wednesday for the killing or capture of two Chechen rebel leaders, and a top general said Moscow reserved the right to make pre-emptive strikes against terrorists abroad. </p> <p> In an emerging government reaction that echoed statements in Washington after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, several lawmakers also proposed steps to tighten domestic security in response to last week's horrific schoolhouse hostage siege in North Ossetia, in which more than 300 children, parents, teachers and attackers were killed. </p> <p> As Russia began two days of national mourning for the victims of a school siege in North Ossetia, criticism mounted over the government's handling of the wave of terrorism that has taken more than 500 lives in the past two weeks. </p> <p> Television news programs showed processions of coffins in muddy fields where more than 150 people were buried Monday after the three-day siege at the school last week that left at least 338 people dead, about half of them children. Mourners left candles at makeshift shrines but also bottles of water, which the hostage-takers had denied their captives. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin ordered a stunning overhaul of Russia's political system on Monday in what he called an effort to unite the country against terrorism. If enacted, as expected, the proposals would strengthen his already pervasive control over the legislative branch and regional governments. </p> <p> Mr. Putin, meeting in special session with cabinet ministers and regional government leaders, outlined what would be the most sweeping political overhaul -- and his most striking single step to consolidate power -- in Russia in more than a decade. Critics immediately said it would violate the Constitution and stifle what political opposition remains. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin said Monday that international terrorists in Iraq hoped their attacks would unseat President Bush in the election next month, and that such an outcome might embolden their efforts and lead to more terrorist acts. </p> <p> Mr. Putin spoke at a news conference at a regional meeting in Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan. A transcript was provided here by the Kremlin. He was asked how the war in Iraq would influence the election, and which candidate -- President Bush or Senator John Kerry -- would be better for him personally. </p> <p> Hundreds of thousands of conscripts in the Russian armed services are abused each year under a cruel system of hazing that military leaders have been unwilling to stop, a rights organization said in a report made public on Wednesday. </p> <p> The report, by Human Rights Watch, said the tradition is so vicious that thousands of first-year Russia soldiers are injured and dozens of them die. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin may have cowed Russia's national political leadership with his plan to concentrate still more power in the Kremlin, but in regions of the country that stand to lose the most, he has inflamed fierce popular discontent. </p> <p> People in this region along the Volga denounced Mr. Putin's proposal to end direct elections of governors and other regional leaders as unconstitutional and potentially destabilizing. They fear that the Kremlin is planning further steps to recreate a Soviet-like power over the people. </p> <p> Alu Alkhanov, the Kremlin's latest hope for stabilizing its foundering strategy in the Caucasus, was sworn into office here on Tuesday as president of Chechnya, taking control of the government of a republic with its infrastructure in ruins and its nights racked by lawlessness and terror. </p> <p> The ceremony took place on the first day of what is supposed to be a four-year term. Of all the difficult tasks ahead -- and there are many -- Mr. Alkhanov's chief chore may be to stay alive. </p> <p> Russia's lower house of Parliament took its first step on Friday toward adopting President Vladimir V. Putin's overhaul of the country's political system, despite signs of popular dissent, particularly in regions distant from the capital. </p> <p> After demonstrators protested the changes at a second day of rallies in Moscow, the lower house voted overwhelmingly to accept a core part of Mr. Putin's proposals: replacing popular elections of governors and other leaders of Russia's 89 regions with Kremlin appointments. </p> <p> Russia's lower house of Parliament voted overwhelmingly on Friday to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, setting the stage for enactment early next year of the pioneering international treaty aimed at reducing emissions blamed for global warming. </p> <p> The Parliament's vote was widely expected after President Vladimir V. Putin's government endorsed the long-delayed treaty late last month, ending years of internal debate over its potential effects on Russia and its economy. Nevertheless, environmental groups hailed Russia's latest step as a landmark in environmental diplomacy. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin, meeting with Russia's defense officials and military commanders here, said Wednesday that the country would soon deploy new nuclear missile systems that would surpass those of any other nuclear power. </p> <p> Reiterating previous statements and providing no new details, Mr. Putin said Russia would continue to emphasize its nuclear deterrent, even as it continues its focus on terrorism, which has roiled the country in recent months with deadly results. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin on Friday signed Russia's ratification of the Kyoto Protocol on global warming, the Kremlin announced, clearing the way for the international treaty aimed at reducing emissions of heat-trapping gases to take effect early next year. </p> <p> With Mr. Putin's signature, Russia became the 126th country to ratify the treaty, but one of the most important ones after the United States, Australia and others rejected it. </p> <p> On the Friday before the disputed Ukrainian election plunged the former Soviet republic into political crisis, President Bush asked Senator Richard G. Lugar to carry a letter to Ukraine's departing president, Leonid D. Kuchma, threatening consequences should there be improprieties in the voting. </p> <p> But just over a week later, after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had declared the results of the election ''absolutely clear'' even as international monitors were reporting widespread fraud and abuse, Mr. Bush took a far more conciliatory position. Speaking near his ranch in Texas on Monday, he said he hoped the impasse would be resolved in a way that brought ''credit and confidence'' to a young democratic government that has been independent from the former Soviet Union for only 13 years. </p> <p> Not since NATO's war in Kosovo, or perhaps the cold war itself, have the political differences between Russia and the West appeared so starkly as they have in Ukraine's disputed presidential election. </p> <p> It is not just that Russia and President Vladimir V. Putin himself have come out so strongly for the candidate promising closer relations with Moscow, Viktor F. Yanukovich, while Europe and the United States are supporting Viktor A. Yushchenko, albeit more subtly. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin warned Russia's business elite on Tuesday to ''get used to paying taxes and observing the law,'' but he also sought to allay investor fears that the Kremlin might be preparing new attacks on Russian business. </p> <p> Speaking at the annual meeting of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Russia's main business lobby, Mr. Putin sought to counter the fallout from the Kremlin-backed attack on the oil giant Yukos, which has been severely weakened by the government's pursuit of $18.4 billion in back taxes. The Yukos affair has prompted capital flight and investor anxiety about the commitment to property rights in Russia. </p> <p> President Bush's electoral victory was greeted internationally on Wednesday with a mixture of praise, disappointment and pragmatic resignation as world leaders jostled to congratulate the president while seeking to influence his foreign policy agenda for the second term. </p> <p> From street corners, parliament halls and palaces, politicians and sidewalk pundits offered Mr. Bush unsolicited advice on how to strengthen America's effectiveness overseas by improving working relations with its allies and fulfilling a longstanding pledge to push for a permanent peace settlement between Israelis and Palestinians. </p> <p> Voters in Ukraine waited in the early-morning hours on Monday for clear results of the runoff presidential election between two candidates who represent very different courses for a nation bridging Russia and the West. </p> <p> Polls closed Sunday at 8 p.m. after a mostly calm day in the capital. There were reports of scattered violence in outlying regions, and of supporters for both candidates claiming that voting had been marked by ballot-stuffing, falsification and efforts to intimidate and disenfranchise voters at the polls. </p> <p> Here's a suggestion for President Bush from the protesters behind the democratic ''orange revolution'' here: Wear an orange tie. </p> <p> ''If he wore an orange tie, people here would be crying,'' said Yuri Maluta, a protester from Lviv. ''It would show that the American president supports democracy here.'' </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin waded deep into Ukraine's electoral crisis on Thursday, dismissing the challenger's demand for a repeat of the disputed presidential runoff election and criticizing European efforts to mediate. </p> <p> Mr. Putin made his remarks during a meeting with President Leonid D. Kuchma, who made an unexpected trip to Russia even as Ukrainian lawmakers wrangled over the details of holding new elections and the Supreme Court heard arguments to nullify the results of the vote on Nov. 21, which was tainted by allegations of widespread fraud. </p> <p> The Bush administration said Thursday that it had faith in Secretary General Kofi Annan and did not want to see him leave office, its first show of support for the United Nations official since calls for his resignation last week. </p> <p> ''We are expressing confidence in the secretary general and in his continuing in office,'' Ambassador John C. Danforth said to reporters who had been alerted by the United States mission that Mr. Danforth would be delivering an important message. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin offered the first official insight on Tuesday into purchasers of the largest subsidiary of the oil giant Yukos, and suggested that these secretive buyers, as had been suspected, might transfer the assets to other owners. </p> <p> ''The shareholders of that company are exclusively private individuals,'' Mr. Putin said in remarks broadcast from Germany, where he is on an official visit. ''But they are individuals who have for many years engaged in the energy business.'' </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin on Monday adjusted his hard-line position on the presidential election in Ukraine, saying that he would accept the choice of the Ukrainian people and would work with whichever candidate wins the second runoff election, now scheduled for Dec. 26. </p> <p> Mr. Putin effectively conceded that his unequivocal choice for the Ukrainian presidency, Prime Minister Viktor F. Yanukovich, might not prevail in the repeat vote, leaving him few options but to accept a victory by the opposition candidate, Viktor A. Yushchenko. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin's steady accretion of power over Russian business, as over politics and society, hit another obstacle, this time in a courthouse in faraway Houston. This is fast becoming a trend. </p> <p> The United States Bankruptcy Court acted to restrain Russia's gas monopoly and its potential lenders from taking part in the auctioning of Yukos Oil's main subsidiary. That ruling, on Thursday, will probably not save the oil company from its state-orchestrated annihilation. </p> <p> It took less than six minutes on Sunday to drive Russia back in time. </p> <p> After successfully luring billions of dollars from foreign investors who believed that capitalism was finally making strides in Russia, Moscow switched directions on Sunday with a snap auction to dismantle the oil giant Yukos that set off criticism both at home and abroad. </p> <p> The Kremlin's words reached a shrill peak on Wednesday over the election crisis in Ukraine, as Russian officials here dusted off cold war vocabulary and summoned bitter visions of lost imperial ambitions and fears of Western meddling in Russia's sphere of influence. </p> <p> The words began flowing in earnest over the weekend, as a Kremlin political strategist, Gleb O. Pavlovsky, voiced what many Russians fear is the true cause of the Ukrainian political crisis: that the West is using Ukraine as a testing ground for a ''revolution'' that may subsequently spread to Russia. </p> <p> THE election crisis unfolding in Ukraine is a foretaste of the problems the European Union will confront in coming decades at its eastern edge. To be sure, what is being played out in Kiev has little to do with the West. Ukraine's democratic revolution was delayed for 13 years by former Soviet bosses who recycled themselves as nationalist politicians, ''privatizing'' into their own hands the assets of the Communist state. For a decade, President Leonid Kuchma has enriched his family (and debased his country) by pursuing his ''Ukrainian way forward'': avoiding, as he explained back in 1995, ''blindly copying foreign experience.'' Many Ukrainians have finally had enough. </p> <p> But a more democratic Ukraine would pose a conundrum for Europe. Unlike Poland or the Czech Republic, Ukraine was not a captive satellite state: it was part of the Soviet Union itself. Its ties to Russia go back a very long way: it was Ukrainian villages that Potemkin spruced up for Catherine the Great on her 1787 tour of inspection. Nikita Khrushchev and Leonid Brezhnev were ethnic Russians from Ukraine (Russians today constitute about one-sixth of the national population, primarily in the southeast). The country's natural resources -- agriculture, coal, titanium -- were a vital element of the Soviet economy. While making up just 2.7 percent of the land area of the Soviet Union, Ukraine generated nearly 18 percent of its gross national product. Little wonder that President Vladimir Putin of Russia now feels no compunction about interfering in Ukrainian elections. This is not just another Central European state hoping to escape out of its history and into ''Europe'': this is Russia's (very) near west. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin on Thursday strongly defended Russia's takeover of the main subsidiary of the Yukos oil company by a state oil company. He also expressed deep irritation at the West's support for popular uprisings in post-Soviet states and what he described as Western double standards for elections. </p> <p> Mr. Putin's remarks, made at an annual holiday-season news conference in the Kremlin, amounted to a forceful restatement of widely known positions and a sometimes layered explanation of the views driving Russia in an increasingly autocratic direction this year. But even as Mr. Putin maintained a calm demeanor, at times speaking softly, his statements were notable for their sharp tone. </p> <p> Tatyana and Alyona Morozov hired a former state security agent to represent their interests in the trial of two men accused of transporting explosives used in the bombing of a Moscow apartment in 1999 that killed dozens of people, including their mother. Now they are trying to get him out of jail. </p> <p> The former agent, Mikhail Trepashkin, who had worked for both the K.G.B. and its successor, the F.S.B., was sentenced in May to four years in prison for revealing state secrets during his investigation with liberal legislators of the apartment bombing and two others that killed 243 people in Moscow and southern Russia in 1999. </p> <p> Russia's lower house of Parliament overwhelmingly voted to give preliminary approval on Friday to a counterterrorism law that would hand the Kremlin broad powers to declare states of emergency, restrict free speech and clamp down on communications, organizations and the news media in cases of terrorist threats or attacks. </p> <p> Legislators voted 385 to 47 in favor of the law, which must pass two more readings in the lower house, the Duma, before being handed over to the upper chamber, the Federation Council. The main opposition came from the Communist Party and the handful of independent members of the Duma. </p> <p> The man declared the winner of Ukraine's disputed presidential election, Prime Minister Viktor F. Yanukovich, said Tuesday that he was prepared to accept a new vote and offered not to run again as long as his challenger also stepped aside. </p> <p> Viktor A. Yushchenko, the opposition leader who claims to have won the election on Nov. 21, immediately dismissed the proposal, along with Mr. Yanukovich's offer to appoint him as prime minister and consider amendments to the Constitution that would share power between the country's starkly divided blocs. </p> <p> The elder President Bush's most memorable foreign-policy blunder took place in Kiev in 1991, then under Communist rule. With the Soviet Union coming apart, the U.S. president -- badly advised by the stability-obsessed ''realist'' Brent Scowcroft -- made a speech urging Ukrainians yearning for independence to beware of ''suicidal nationalism.'' His speech, which he now insists meant only ''not so fast,'' was widely taken as advice to remain loyal to Moscow's empire. </p> <p> I dubbed this the ''Chicken Kiev'' speech. That so infuriated Bush, who mistakenly saw the phrase as imputing cowardice rather than charging colossal misjudgment, that he has not spoken to me since. </p> <p> In these long winter nights, a headless horseman is roaming Russia's ''near abroad,'' threatening independent countries and raising fears of a renewed cold war. </p> <p> This specter is Vladimir Putin. Let's hope he finds his head soon. </p> <p> Facing an unusual wave of public protest, President Vladimir V. Putin on Monday pointedly criticized the government he had appointed for mishandling a new law replacing social benefits for retirees with cash payments that have been derided as meager. </p> <p> Meeting with his government ministers, Mr. Putin called for raising and accelerating an increase in pensions scheduled to take effect in April. He defended the new law, but said that the changes in social benefits, which his government pushed through Parliament over opposition protests last year, should not punish Russia's poorest citizens. </p> <p> Viktor A. Yushchenko, his face disfigured by poison and his fate nearly undone by electoral fraud, took the oath of office as president of Ukraine on Sunday, vowing to unite a poor and deeply divided country and lead it into the mainstream of Europe. </p> <p> Speaking first in Parliament and then in Kiev's central square, Mr. Yushchenko declared Ukraine's freedom and independence in thinly veiled remarks aimed at the departing president, Leonid D. Kuchma, and at Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin, who openly supported Mr. Yushchenko's opponent. </p> <p> Mikhail I. Yermakov, a retired engineer, has never before taken to the streets to protest -- not when the Soviet Union collapsed, the wars in Chechnya began, the ruble plummeted in 1998 or President Vladimir V. Putin last year ended his right to choose his governor. </p> <p> On Saturday, however, he joined hundreds of others in the central square of this gritty industrial city on the edge of Moscow in the latest of a weeklong wave of protests across Russia against a new law abolishing a wide range of social benefits for the country's 32 million pensioners, veterans and people with disabilities. </p> <p> Condoleezza Rice, President Bush's nominee for secretary of state, refused Tuesday to set any timetable for the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq, but declared that the United States was making ''some progress'' in training Iraqi security forces. </p> <p> Under persistent bipartisan questioning at her confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Ms. Rice also declared that beyond strengthening Iraq's fledgling police and military, the most urgent task facing Iraqis after the elections was to overcome differences among Sunni Arabs, Shiites, Kurds and others by seeking political reconciliation among themselves. </p> <p> Ukraine's Parliament voted Thursday to inaugurate Viktor A. Yushchenko as the country's next president on Sunday, nearly three months after the first votes were cast. </p> <p> Mr. Yushchenko's inauguration -- only the country's third since gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 -- will end an electoral crisis that prompted huge public demonstrations and behind-the-scenes intrigue, that deeply divided the country and that soured relations with Russia. </p> <p> President Viktor A. Yushchenko of Ukraine and President Vladimir V. Putin moved publicly on Monday at a meeting at the Kremlin to set aside what had seemed sharp political and personal differences. They pledged to cooperate in the years ahead, even as Ukraine endeavors to align itself more closely with Europe. </p> <p> The visit, made on Mr. Yushchenko's first full day in office and after tensions between the two men had risen during the election campaign and political upset in Ukraine, was an implicit acknowledgment of the myriad connections that bind Russia and Ukraine no matter the direction Mr. Yushchenko might try to steer his nation. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin on Monday abruptly reduced the responsibilities of a senior adviser who last week issued a sweeping criticism of the Kremlin's leadership and expressed deep misgivings about the direction in which Russia was headed. </p> <p> In a presidential decree released without further comment, Mr. Putin relieved the adviser, Andrei N. Illarionov, of his duties as Russia's envoy to the Group of 8, comprising the world's major industrialized nations and Russia. Mr. Putin reassigned those duties to a presidential aide who is seemingly a more loyal Kremlin insider, Igor I. Shuvalov. </p> <p> Genry Koptev Gomolov was just 18 when he first saw this place, on Jan. 27, 1945. He had been drafted into the Red Army two years earlier and was making his way on foot across the Polish countryside with the remains of his battalion when they stumbled upon the Nazis' largest death camp. </p> <p> ''It was cold and gloomy with wet snow falling, like now,'' Mr. Gomolov said, riding a bus toward the camp for his first visit there in 60 years. He and two other former Red Army soldiers were guests of honor at a ceremony here Thursday marking the anniversary of the camp's liberation. </p> <p> President Bush expressed concern on Thursday night about Russia's commitment to democracy in a sometimes tense and awkward encounter with President Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Putin, at times visibly uncomfortable, refused to yield. </p> <p> ''Democracies have certain things in common -- a rule of law and protection of minorities and a free press and a viable political opposition,'' Mr. Bush said after a private meeting that lasted more than an hour, chiding Mr. Putin gently though more directly than ever before. ''I was able to share my concerns about Russia's commitment in fulfilling these universal principles.'' </p> <p> For all of the advance billing and anticipation, President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia emerged from their private meeting in Bratislava, Slovakia on Thursday and chose to stand together and emphasize the narrowing areas where their nations could agree. </p> <p> Much was said gently, or avoided altogether, at least in public. The presidents focused their remarks after the meeting on personal trust and on commitments to fight terrorism and control the spread of weapons or materials terrorists might use. While raised, Western concerns about the decline in the development of democracy in Russia were muted after a period in which Mr. Bush heightened expectations with soaring language on the irresistible lure of freedom and democracy. </p> <p> Following are excerpts from a transcript of the news conference of President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia yesterday in Bratislava, Slovakia, as recorded by Federal News Service Inc. Mr. Putin's remarks were provided through a translator. A full transcript is at nytimes.com/international. </p> <p> MR. BUSH: It's very important that we establish not only a working relationship, but that we understand that in the 21st century strong countries are built by developing strong democracies. And so we talked about democracy. Democracies always reflect a country's customs and culture, and I know that. Yet democracies have certain things in common; they have a rule of law and protection of minorities, a free press and a viable political opposition. </p> <p> Czar Nicholas II dancing in tights has touched off a protest against the touring ballet ''Rasputin'' among Russian Orthodox faithful in Yekaterinburg, the city where the Bolsheviks killed Nicholas and his family in 1918. According to reports in the Russian media, they are angered not by the portrayal of Rasputin, the monk who held sway over the imperial family, but about that of Nicholas. A priest representing the local diocese told the newspaper Kommersant that it is offensive that ''he is not dancing in a czar's costume but in tights. Is it necessary to make fun of saints?'' The Russian Orthodox Church canonized the czar and his family in 2000. The production, which had its premiere in St. Petersburg last year, is being performed in Yekaterinburg by the New Imperial Russian Ballet in a theater near the Church of Spilled Blood, which was built recently on the site of the Romanovs' execution and draws many pilgrims. </p> <p> SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY </p> <p> One of the strangest kabuki dances of George W. Bush's presidency was his news conference last week with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in Bratislava, Slovakia. For 34 minutes, with bits of sweat on his upper lip, Mr. Bush had to contort himself into a public reprimand of Mr. Putin for Russia's slide from democracy while asserting that their relationship was just great. </p> <p> The body language suggested otherwise. To be in the room at the medieval Bratislava Castle overlooking the Danube was to be transfixed by the spectacle of a big, friendly Labrador retriever trying to cozy up to a cat. As the presidents stood side by side at their matching lecterns, Mr. Bush smiled and gestured and tried to warm up ''Vladimir,'' who stood in icy repose, refusing to be charmed. </p> <p> Following are excerpts from President Bush's speech yesterday in Brussels, as provided by the White House. The full transcript is on the Web at nytimes.com/world. </p> <p> Our greatest opportunity and immediate goal is peace in the Middle East. After many false starts, and dashed hopes, and stolen lives, a settlement of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is now within reach. America and Europe have made a moral commitment: We will not stand by as another generation in the Holy Land grows up in an atmosphere of violence and hopelessness. America and Europe also share a strategic interest: By helping to build a lasting peace, we will remove an unsettled grievance that is used to stir hatred and violence across the Middle East. </p> <p> President Bush warned Russia on Monday that it ''must renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law,'' but said he believed that the nation's future lay ''within the family of Europe and the trans-Atlantic community.'' </p> <p> The president's words opened his first trip across the Atlantic since his re-election and were part of a speech aimed at building a new relationship with Europe after the dispute over the American-led invasion of Iraq. </p> <p> Few people in President Bush's entourage seemed happier to get home from Europe late Thursday night than Mr. Bush himself, who spent his week in meetings with three of the prickliest characters in current American foreign relations -- President Jacques Chirac of France, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. </p> <p> Unlike other American presidents, who often used trips to Europe as diversions from the scandals and politics of home, Mr. Bush spent four days in chocolate-making countries like Belgium eating his peas. </p> <p> President Bush's determined effort to raise Russia's crackdown on independent businesses and internal dissent with President Vladimir V. Putin when they meet this week is likely to get a tart response, according to the Russian ambassador to the United States, Yuri Ushakov. </p> <p> In written answers to questions submitted by The New York Times before Mr. Bush left for Europe on Sunday, Mr. Ushakov said Mr. Putin was likely to respond to Mr. Bush's criticism by raising ''our own concerns about the situation in the United States and certain troubling aspects of Washington's policies.'' </p> <p> The lower house of Parliament voted Friday to condemn anti-Semitism after an uproar touched off when a group of mostly nationalist and Communist legislators demanded last month that Jewish organizations be investigated and even outlawed for fomenting ethnic hatred and stimulating anti-Semitism themselves. </p> <p> But while 306 lawmakers approved the nonbinding resolution, 58 refused to endorse it. ''There should be no room for anti-Semitism or ethnic and religious hatred,'' the resolution said. ''Any steps aimed at inciting national or religious dissent and hatred must be stopped immediately.'' </p> <p> GIVEN the diplomatic challenges facing President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, it's good that they are meeting today in Bratislava, Slovakia. In doing so, they are keeping alive a useful and time-honored practice. After all, the principal occupants of the White House and Kremlin have been sitting down together since the chilliest days of the cold war. But the way things are going in Russia, it may be harder to justify Mr. Bush's next encounter with Mr. Putin at the annual summit meeting of the Group of 8 major industrialized countries at the Gleneagles resort in Perthshire, Scotland, in July. </p> <p> Members of the group (Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan as well as Russia and the United States) are supposed to share a commitment to multiparty democracy, rule of law, freedom of the press, protection of human and civil rights, and respect for the sovereignty of their neighbors. Mr. Putin's concentration of power, his crackdown on the independent news media, his scorched-earth policy in Chechnya, and his bullying of Georgia and Ukraine have jeopardized Russia's membership in that club. </p> <p> A month ago a small crowd of elderly men and women briefly blocked the highway to Moscow's main international airport to protest changes in pension benefits. It seemed insignificant then, but in retrospect it seems to have been the first stirrings of something long considered dead, or at least dormant, in Russia: the public protest. </p> <p> In Beslan, relatives of those killed in the siege of Middle School No.1 last September blocked the main highway across the North Caucasus for three days in late January to protest the pace of the government's official investigation into the terrorist attack. On the island of Sakhalin in the Far East, ecologists joined local villagers in blocking roads leading to new oil and gas projects to protest their effect on the environment and local tribal cultures. </p> <p> More than ever, painful changes in Russia's economy are hurting citizens on government assistance, and the effect is being magnified by inflation. </p> <p> Russia missed its 10 percent inflation target for 2004, ending up with 11.7 percent. That has cast doubt on the feasibility of this year's 8.5 percent target. </p> <p> Francis Ford Coppola met in the Kremlin with President Vladimir V. Putin, below, before receiving a prize for his contribution to world cinema on Saturday night at the Golden Eagle film award ceremony, Russia's version of the Oscars. Mr. Putin told the film director that his works were ''well known and highly valued,'' making reference to ''The Godfather'' and ''especially your work that faithfully recounted the horrors of war -- the horrors at the time of the Vietnam War.'' Mr. Coppola presented him with a DVD of his daughter Sofia Coppola's Oscar-winning film, ''Lost in Translation.'' </p> <p> SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY </p> <p> Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told a top Russian envoy Saturday that Moscow's crackdown on dissent was making Russian-American relations ''more difficult,'' a State Department official said. But Ms. Rice also signaled in public that the United States would not try to isolate Russia because of its actions. </p> <p> The State Department official, speaking after a dinner between Ms. Rice and Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov, said the secretary cited Russia's steps to take over independent television, seize the oil company Yukos and arrest its leaders, and remove powers from state governors. </p> <p> It was remarkable to see President Bush lecture Vladimir Putin on the importance of checks and balances in a democratic society. </p> <p> Remarkably brazen, given that the only checks Mr. Bush seems to believe in are those written to the ''journalists'' Armstrong Williams, Maggie Gallagher and Karen Ryan, the fake TV anchor, to help promote his policies. The administration has given a whole new meaning to checkbook journalism, paying a stupendous $97 million to an outside P.R. firm to buy columnists and produce propaganda, including faux video news releases. </p> <p> In recent weeks, President Vladimir V. Putin's politics have generated most of the worry in the West. He has been cutting welfare benefits for veterans and pensioners, clamping down on free media and meddling in the Ukrainian election. Even President Bush, who badly needs the Kremlin's cooperation in combating terrorism, the spread of nuclear weapons and narcotics trafficking, gently chided Mr. Putin about maintaining democratic standards when the two met in Bratislava last week. </p> <p> But the president's concerns about democratic principles may miss the larger point. The real threat to Russia's future could lie in the economy. For now, its gross domestic product is booming, it boasts a budget surplus and a windfall from record high oil prices. But it is pursuing a model of corrupt, state-managed capitalism, economists and political analysts say, that is inimical to democracy and could condemn its economy to perpetual third world status. </p> <p> The loveliest street in Chechnya runs for all of a block here in the battered republic's second largest city. </p> <p> It is lined with trees, paved and washed. The buildings, new or newly renovated, include a cultural center and two shops. One deals in mobile phones, which only recently began to work in Chechnya. The other sells jewelry, including a necklace set that costs the equivalent of $19,000, an astonishing price in a place devastated by a decade of war and mired in abject poverty. </p> <p> Russian special forces killed the leader of Chechnya's separatists, Aslan Maskhadov, on Tuesday in a raid that gave the Kremlin a rare victory in a bloody war that has killed tens of thousands and spawned a wave of terrorist attacks across Russia in recent years. </p> <p> Mr. Maskhadov, who from hiding led thousands of fighters after Russia's second invasion of Chechnya in 1999, died in a bunker beneath a house in an outwardly peaceful village, Tolstoy-Yurt, only 12 miles from the region's capital, Grozny, according to officials and news accounts. </p> <p> In the first decade after the collapse of the Soviet Union, democracy took root in most of its republics in name only. With the exception of the Baltic republics -- Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, now deeply entwined in Europe -- new political systems and new leaders emerged from the post-Soviet chaos promising freedoms but somehow managing to ensure that those freedoms led to the continuation of their power. </p> <p> But in the last year and a half, popular uprisings have claimed the sclerotic leadership of three former Soviet republics. In Georgia in November 2003, in Ukraine a year later and now in Kyrgyzstan, simmering discontent accomplished what not long ago seemed improbable: the peaceful overthrow of governments that ceased to represent the will of the people. </p> <p> Protesters alleging corruption, repression and electoral fraud forced the longtime president of this central Asian country to flee his palace on Thursday, the third time a government of a former Soviet republic has been toppled in a popular uprising in a year and a half. </p> <p> President Askar Akayev and his family fled Bishkek, the Kyrgyz capital, after crowds at a large opposition rally seized control of the presidential palace and began looting it. Kyrgyzstan's Parliament elected a former opposition lawmaker, Ishenbai Kadyrbekov, as the country's interim president. It was unclear whether the decision was legally binding, in part because of uncertainty over whether Mr. Akayev, whose whereabouts were unknown, had stepped down. </p> <p> In an effort to steady Russia's business climate, President Vladimir V. Putin said Thursday that he favored a change in the law that would effectively end investigations into the privatizations of the 1990's. </p> <p> Mr. Putin said he would support a law that would reduce the inquiries to 3 years from the current 10 years -- potentially clearing dozens of so-called oligarchs who gained their wealth in questionable asset sales. The law would end the possibility of inquiries into privatizations in the mid-1990's to late 1990's in oil, metals, cars and utilities. </p> <p> The leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Spain gathered for an informal meeting here on Friday and issued a joint statement urging Syria to withdraw troops and security services from Lebanon. They also said they were united in their desire to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. </p> <p> The meeting, preceded by a lunch between President Jacques Chirac of France and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, was meant partly to bolster Russian-European Union relations and overcome growing unease with Mr. Putin's increasingly authoritarian governance. Recent restrictions on the Russian news media and increasing economic recentralization, in particular, have raised concerns in Europe. </p> <p> A longtime business associate of the imprisoned Russian oil tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky spoke out from self-imposed exile here on Sunday, denying criminal charges by the Russian authorities and saying the accusations against him are a continuation of a Kremlin campaign of intimidation. </p> <p> ''The situation in Russia today I would describe as Stalinism,'' the associate, Leonid B. Nevzlin, said in a rare interview at his home in Herzliya, Israel's high-tech hub in the Tel Aviv suburbs. He said President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ''enjoys the absolute power of one person, in that he uses the law enforcement system and the lack of free press'' to intimidate Russia's business elite and renationalize Yukos, once Russia's largest private oil company. </p> <p> Garry Kasparov is certain that his place in history as a chess player is secure. But now he says he has a new goal: nothing less than achieving real democracy in Russia. </p> <p> Mr. Kasparov, the world's top-ranked player for the last 20 years, announced on March 10 that he was retiring from competition. On Sunday he discussed his legacy and plans in an interview at a Manhattan hotel. </p> <p> After facing months of criticism for Russia's crackdown on freedoms and its concentration of presidential power, President Vladimir V. Putin said Monday that encouraging democracy was the main task before the nation and that human rights, freedom and a secure business climate were essential for the health of the state. </p> <p> In his annual address to Parliament, Mr. Putin offered a vision that at times and on the surface appeared to embrace the language of some of his most prominent critics. </p> <p> Here on the southwestern edge of the Urals, a popular uprising against a regional government is posing one of the most significant challenges yet to President Vladimir V. Putin's political control, raising the possibility that civic protest may be spreading into Russia from its periphery. </p> <p> Heartened by the political upheavals in two of Russia's neighbors, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan, thousands here have staged a series of demonstrations since February calling for the ouster of the president of the Bashkortostan region, Murtaza G. Rakhimov. </p> <p> Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice offered reassurances on Wednesday to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and to listeners of a popular Moscow radio station that the United States would not supplant Russia's influence in its neighborhood despite growing American friendship with other countries in the region. </p> <p> But in a long day of talks and interviews in Russia, before flying here to Lithuania for a NATO meeting, Ms. Rice continued to suggest that Russia needed to do more to foster economic and political freedoms. </p> <p> The last name of the president of Russia is Putin, right? Not so fast. Paris, we have a pronunciation problem. To solve it, we must plunge headlong in the argumentative world of transliteration -- the representation of sounds of words from one alphabet in another alphabet. However you do it, with whatever authority you cite, some native speaker will surely tell you that you're all wrong. </p> <p> We in the English-speaking world, and in most of the Western world using the 26-letter Roman alphabet, write the Russian president's name as ''Putin.'' That's not a good transliteration from the 32-letter modern Cyrillic alphabet, which the Russians use, because our Roman spelling suggests we pronounce it PYOO-tin, as in ''putrid,'' or PUT-in, as in ''put-down.'' </p> <p> Vladimir Putin gave a bizarre speech this week in which he described the fall of the Soviet Union as ''the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century'' and said that an ''epidemic of collapse has spilled over to Russia itself.'' </p> <p> The sad thing is he is half right. </p> <p> The most prominent criminal trial in post-Soviet Russia drew to a close on Monday after the former oil tycoon Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky made a final plea of innocence and the chief judge announced that she would hand down a verdict on April 27. </p> <p> After 10 months of testimony and evidence presented in a cramped Moscow courtroom, Mr. Khodorkovsky remained as defiant as when he was arrested in October 2003. He called the criminal charges against him and his partner, Platon Lebedev, a farce and said that history would ultimately vindicate him. </p> <p> Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, reiterating American concerns about authoritarian trends in the Kremlin under President Vladimir V. Putin, said Tuesday that Russia's coming leadership of the Group of 8 industrial nations next year gave it ''certain responsibilities'' to guarantee economic and political freedoms. </p> <p> Some critics of the Bush administration said Washington should threaten to remove Russia from the group if Moscow did not improve its record on human rights and democracy. Ms. Rice has repeatedly dismissed that approach as counterproductive, a position she reiterated. </p> <p> On the first visit by a Kremlin leader to Israel, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Thursday tried to allay fears that Israel's security was threatened by Russia's nuclear assistance to Iran and missile sales to Syria. </p> <p> Israel gave Mr. Putin a red-carpet welcome, including separate meetings with President Moshe Katsav and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and a somber visit to Israel's Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem. But Israeli leaders also made it clear that they viewed Russian help for Israel's enemies as a serious danger. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia urged Israel on Friday to allow Palestinian security forces the weaponry required to fight terrorism as he completed a three-day visit to the Middle East intended to revive Russia's fading influence in the region. </p> <p> Mr. Putin met with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, for two hours to discuss peace talks and renewed Russian economic and security aid to the Palestinians, Moscow's former clients. </p> <p> A former senior aide to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and his predecessor, Boris N. Yeltsin, said on Wednesday that neither he nor anyone else in the Kremlin had received the rights from Saddam Hussein to sell Iraqi oil under a United Nations program, as a United States Senate subcommittee has charged. </p> <p> The aide, Aleksandr S. Voloshin, strongly disputed the findings of the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. He denied that he or any other official had made any deals in exchange for support for Iraq in its political struggle with the United States before Mr. Hussein was overthrown in 2003. </p> <p> MY parents named me Victor in honor of the Soviet Union's victory over Hitler, and I am proud of my name. I see no reason to cast doubt on the historical significance of that victory; for years the Russian people, who lost millions of soldiers in the war, have united around the celebration of Victory Day. Yet, as we mark the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II, we are seeing not so much a celebration as a major disagreement between millions of people, and even between nations. </p> <p> This city, having summoned distinguished foreign guests for the occasion, chose to celebrate victory in genuine military-camp style, full of gun-carrying army and police patrols more fearful of terrorist attacks than ever before. And who exactly is to blame for these painful paradoxes? President Vladimir Putin himself effectively answered that question in his recent declaration that the collapse of the Soviet Union was ''the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.'' </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin, joined by President Bush and dozens of other leaders, commemorated the 60th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany on Monday with a resplendent military parade in Red Square that was steeped in Soviet symbols and new Russian pride. </p> <p> Standing in front of Lenin's Tomb, not on it as Soviet leaders once did, Mr. Putin expressed no contrition for the Soviet domination of Eastern and Central Europe that followed the end of World War II, as some leaders from that region had hoped he would. Instead, he said the war's legacy demonstrated the need for unity with Russia against new threats. </p> <p> Speaking calmly about a subject that has sometimes drawn his anger, President Vladimir V. Putin on Friday acknowledged that Russia had lingering problems with human rights, and said his administration would work actively in the next two years to make improvements. </p> <p> Mr. Putin's made his remarks on national television to Álvaro Gil-Robles, the commissioner for human rights at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, who in April completed a finely detailed report on human rights conditions in Russia. </p> <p> President Bush met Sunday night with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in what was widely expected to be a tense encounter after days of recriminations over Russian rollbacks of democracy and the Soviet Union's actions in the World War II era, but the top foreign policy advisers to both men swiftly pronounced the meeting a success. </p> <p> Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, appeared in an unusual joint briefing at a guest house on the grounds of Mr. Putin's presidential dacha outside Moscow to say the two leaders had talked extensively about nuclear proliferation and Israel's plan to withdraw from Gaza this summer. </p> <p> A week ago, on the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and President Vladimir V. Putin appeared together in Red Square in a symbolic nod to the historical reconciliation between Germany and Russia. But a few blocks away, a museum exhibition showed how the war's dark legacies continue to divide the two countries. </p> <p> Shortly before Victory Day, as it is known here, the State Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts put on display 552 ancient works of art, including Greek bronzes, vases and amphorae, Etruscan figures, fragments of Roman wall paintings and Coptic amulets carved from bone, all meticulously restored. </p> <p> The judges in Russia's most prominent criminal trial began reading their verdict on Monday against Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, once the country's richest man, indicating they had concluded that he and his partner had committed crimes, but then postponed a final verdict for at least another day. </p> <p> The climax of Mr. Khodorkovsky's trial began to unfold in a crowded Moscow courtroom much as the government's legal assault has progressed from the start: clouded in confusion, prone to surprise and drowned out by the clamor of those accusing President Vladimir V. Putin of using the case to settle a personal or political score. </p> <p> What with Air Force One, Marine One and the armor-plated limousine, President Bush isn't often behind the wheel. Maybe that's why he found himself struggling to get President Vladimir V. Putin's gleaming 1956 ivory-colored Volga into gear at the Russian president's dacha outside Moscow on Sunday night, in a mishap that was not caught in the pictures of the two waving merrily from the windows of the vintage Russian sedan. </p> <p> The Volga, recently purchased by Mr. Putin and so immaculately restored that it looked as if it belonged in a car museum, had been parked outside Mr. Putin's official meeting house on the dacha grounds as the two presidents held talks. Reporters were told that the two would emerge and drive the Volga the short distance to Mr. Putin's official residence, where the Bushes, the Putins and a few top aides were to have dinner. </p> <p> President Bush told tens of thousands of cheering Georgians packed into the city's Freedom Square on Tuesday that the United States would stand with Georgia, a former Soviet republic, as it built its young democracy, and then pointedly he warned President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia that the sovereignty of Georgia ''must be respected by all nations.'' </p> <p> On the last stop of a five-day trip that also included visits to Russia, Latvia and the Netherlands, Mr. Bush sought to tie the democratic movements in Georgia and other former Soviet republics to his vision for democracy in the Middle East and around the world. He spoke from the square where Georgians gathered in November 2003 for the ''Rose Revolution,'' when Mikheil Saakashvili carried roses as he stormed into Parliament and displaced President Eduard A. Shevardnadze in a bloodless coup. </p> <p> Russia and the European Union signed a long-stalled agreement on Tuesday to forge closer economic, political and social ties, but President Vladimir V. Putin showed that deep tensions with some of the union's newest members remained when he offered pointed condemnations of their policies. </p> <p> Appearing after a summit meeting with European Union leaders here, Mr. Putin praised the agreement as a step toward the creation of a European continent ''with no dividing lines.'' But he then angrily criticized the Baltic nations -- former Soviet republics that joined the European Union last year -- for clinging to historic grievances over Soviet domination. </p> <p> At least 13 people were killed and more than 20 wounded Tuesday when a bomb exploded near a police vehicle in northern Chechnya, according to government officials, who called it a terrorist attack. </p> <p> ''The bloody events perpetrated by terrorists have caused extreme indignation on the part of the entire Chechen people,'' said Chechnya's pro-Moscow president, Alu Alkhanov, in a statement reported by Russian news agencies. </p> <p> The ruins of School No.1 have changed little in a year. Blood remains on the walls in handprints and streaks. A blood-darkened shirt lies in the cafeteria, about the size for a 5-year-old. </p> <p> One wing has been sheared away by tank fire. The gym, its roof burned, is open to the sky. Upstairs, deflated balloons sag where they had been taped to the auditorium ceiling for the first day of school. </p> <p> A businessman here recently formed a company to supply equipment used in new office and apartment buildings. Despite the country's construction boom, it nearly foundered. That is, until this summer, when two ''intermediaries'' arranged to fix the bidding for contracts from a regional government. </p> <p> He has since received four new contracts, he said, and expects more. Success has its cost, though. He had paid bribes, he said, amounting to 5 to 10 percent of each contract. The largest, so far, totaled $90,000. </p> <p> Facing unusually public and personal criticism, President Vladimir V. Putin met Friday with relatives of the victims of the school siege a year ago in Beslan and promised the thorough accounting of the circumstances surrounding it that they have been demanding for months. </p> <p> But Mr. Putin did not directly address the rising fury over the government's handling of the three-day siege, which ended in a convulsion of violence that killed 331 people, 186 of them children. </p> <p> Insurgents attacked at least nine police and security buildings on Thursday in this southern Russian city in coordinated daylight raids, witnesses and the authorities said, further spreading Russia's battle beyond its roots in the breakaway republic of Chechnya. </p> <p> Russian officials said at least 85 people had been killed, most of them insurgents. </p> <p> Ten men gathered in a dim three-room apartment one recent evening to plan the unseating of this country's autocratic president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko. </p> <p> They have little money, no slogans, no songs and, so far, no color like the orange that thousands rallied around during the popular uprising last year in Ukraine. </p> <p> For eight decades he has been lying in state on public display, a cadaver in a succession of dark suits, encased in a glass box beside a walkway in the basement of his granite mausoleum. Many who revere him say he is at peace, the leader in repose beneath the lights. Others think he just looks macabre. </p> <p> Time has been unkind to Lenin, whose remains here in Red Square are said to sprout occasional fungi, and whose ideology and party long ago fell to ruins. Now the inevitable question has returned. Should his body be moved? </p> <p> Russia moved Wednesday to impose greater government control over charities and other private organizations, including some of the world's most prominent, in a move aimed at restricting foreign support for political activity in the country. </p> <p> The lower house of Parliament gave preliminary approval to legislation that would require tens of thousands of Russian organizations to register with the Ministry of Justice. It would also impose restrictions on their ability to accept donations or hire foreigners and prohibit foreign organizations from opening branches in Russia. </p> <p> Presenting a united front against Iran, President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said Friday that they would press Iran to reverse itself and accept a compromise allowing it to enrich uranium, but only in Russia and under strict controls. </p> <p> The plan would let Iran enrich uranium only to levels suitable for use in nuclear reactors, using Russian technology. ''We hope that over time Iran will see the virtue of this approach, and it may provide a way out,'' Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, told reporters here on Friday, after the two leaders met. </p> <p> Japan won a promise on Monday from President Vladimir V. Putin to establish within a year a construction timetable for a pipeline that would carry Siberian oil to the Sea of Japan. </p> <p> Mr. Putin's visit here, his first to Japan in five years, is seen as an attempt to balance Asia's power triangle, left lopsided by flourishing ties between Russia and China. </p> <p> Security officials here in Karachayevo-Cherkessia, a restive republic on Russia's mountainous southern border, have a secret list of people who are kept under scrutiny. </p> <p> Those on it have committed no crimes, but are considered suspect because they are Muslims who practice Islam outside of the state's sanctioned mosques. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin on Thursday defended Russia's right to scrutinize any political activity by foreign and domestic charities and nongovernmental organizations, even as he promised that ''civil society in Russia should not suffer.'' </p> <p> Making his first public remarks on an issue that has caused a furor at home and abroad, Mr. Putin said he would consult with parliamentary leaders on new legislation that would place all private organizations under strict state control and threaten others with being closed down. </p> <p> WHEN we visited Moscow earlier this fall, almost everyone we talked to agreed that Russia is becoming steadily less democratic. Yet Russia's society and economy are in many ways freer than ever. Our visit convinced us of the vitality and potential of Russian civic groups and nongovernmental organizations, much like the ones Western Europeans and Americans know in their own countries. Unfortunately this sector -- human rights monitors, environmental groups, policy research institutions, even public health advocates -- is now at risk. </p> <p> The latest challenge to civil society comes from legislation introduced by members of President Vladimir Putin's party and other factions in the Duma, the lower house of Parliament. This legislation would, among other things, keep foreign nonprofit organizations from having offices in Russia and deny foreign funds to Russian organizations that are suspected of engaging in undefined ''political'' activities. Even the limited grants permitted under the new law would be taxed as though they were corporate profits, at rates exceeding 40 percent. Virtually all nonprofit groups would be affected. </p> <p> First, more than 1,000 nationalists marched openly down Moscow's central thoroughfare on Nov. 4, some handing out racist fliers. Then, about three weeks later, the police broke up a counterprotest on the same street and detained some of the organizers of what was called an ''anti-fascist'' response to the original rally. </p> <p> On Sunday, the latest in the series of dueling rallies over growing anti-immigrant sentiment in Moscow this fall looped through several backstreets in the Russian capital. </p> <p> The most outspoken of President Vladimir V. Putin's senior advisers abruptly resigned Tuesday, warning that Russia's nascent political freedoms have been lost and that the Kremlin's economic choices have been poor. He also said he had no more ability to influence the government's course. </p> <p> The adviser, Andrei N. Illarionov, 44, had been an economic adviser to the Kremlin since shortly after Mr. Putin took office nearly six years ago. His tenure in recent years had turned publicly rocky, and he had become an occasional but memorable critic of Kremlin policy. </p> <p> Russia's lower house of Parliament on Wednesday amended legislation intended to increase the government's control over charities and other private organizations, but left in place core provisions that critics said would open the groups to political pressure or even force them to close. </p> <p> The legislation advanced despite international pressure that included a resolution of the United States Congress and appeals from leading Bush administration officials that the law, if adopted, would stifle free debate and undercut efforts to promote democracy and political pluralism in Russia. </p> <p> Moscow is experiencing a boom in theater construction, a testament both to the importance Russian leaders place on the nation's capital as a cultural showcase and to the money from oil and other commodities flowing through the city's coffers. President Vladimir V. Putin underscored the point Wednesday evening, when he attended the opening of the capital's grandest post-Soviet theater, the nearly $40 million Et Cetera complex in the heart of the city, near the headquarters of one of Russia's largest oil companies and major financial institutions. </p> <p> The complex, the new home of the well-established Et Cetera repertory theater, was inaugurated with a private jazz concert for Mr. Putin; the mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov; and other guests. The general public was treated to a Webcast of a recorded performance of a cornerstone of Et Cetera's repertory: ''Shylock,'' the Georgian director Robert Sturua's interpretation of ''The Merchant of Venice,'' which starred the popular Russian stage and film actor Aleksandr Kalyagin, 63, who is also Et Cetera's director. </p> <p> Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice criticized Russia on Wednesday, saying she had serious concerns about a proposed law that could shut down private groups, including some financed by the United States, that promote democracy, human rights and related issues. </p> <p> She made her remarks during a news conference here with President Viktor A. Yushchenko, who came to power in Ukraine a year ago after a popular uprising. Many leaders of that uprising received instruction and advice from the very groups that Russia is proposing to ban or seriously restrict. </p> <p> Time and again, a phenomenon unfolds on Russian television. Stiff-faced bureaucrats pack a huge concert hall, and after a speech by a leading Kremlin official -- often President Vladimir V. Putin himself -- the show begins. </p> <p> What a patriotic extravaganza it is, combining Las Vegas glitz and the stuffy formalities of a Communist Party congress. There is even a part evoking Bob Hope entertaining the troops. </p> <p> The party of President Vladimir V. Putin took a strong lead on Sunday in city council elections here in what was widely seen as a dress rehearsal for federal elections in 2007 and the election for a successor to Mr. Putin in 2008. </p> <p> Mr. Putin's party, United Russia, had 46 percent of the vote with about 23 percent of it counted. The Communist Party had 17 percent, and a liberal bloc running under the name Yabloko had nearly 11 percent. Throughout the campaign, all of the opposition parties complained about United Russia, the dominant party. </p> <p> For President Vladimir V. Putin and Russia, 2006 was supposed to be a banner year. Instead, it has begun badly, and with problems of the Kremlin's own making. </p> <p> The Kremlin, which labored in 2005 to distance itself from the ill will that accompanied its destruction of the Yukos oil company and the bungled handling of the rigged Ukrainian presidential election in 2004, has begun the new year with a display of politics and bullying, followed by partial retreat, that is raising fresh questions about its reliability as an international energy partner. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin accused foreign intelligence operatives on Wednesday of using private groups to interfere in Russia's internal affairs, saying that accusations that four British diplomats were spies justified new government curbs on the groups. </p> <p> Mr. Putin has previously criticized foreign support for groups involved in politics here, but on Wednesday he linked the groups to intelligence agencies more explicitly than before. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin told Russia's natural gas monopoly, Gazprom, on Saturday to continue selling subsidized gas to Ukraine until the end of March if Ukraine agrees to pay market prices beginning in April. </p> <p> Mr. Putin's order, delivered on national television as Gazprom threatened to cut off gas exports for Ukraine beginning on Jan. 1, put Russia's president in the center of a dispute that has caused Europe to worry whether its gas supply will be disrupted in the January chill. </p> <p> RUSSIA today is not the same country it was only six years ago, when Vladimir Putin became president. Back then, the country was unsettled, tumultuous and impoverished, but it was free. Today Russia is richer -- and not free. </p> <p> A new model of Russia has taken shape. The state has become, essentially, a corporate enterprise that the nominal owners, Russian citizens, no longer control. Indeed, changes in legislation and limitations on political freedoms have effectively devalued the shares in this company -- call it Russian State -- that ordinary Russians hold, while an elite class of investors enjoys ever increasing privileges. </p> <p> Pulling away from an agreed American and European policy, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia said Thursday that he was considering inviting the newly victorious leaders of the radical Palestinian Islamic group Hamas to Moscow to discuss solutions to the conflict in the Middle East. </p> <p> He spoke during a day of chaos and violence in the Gaza Strip, where three armed Palestinians were killed as they attacked Israeli forces and Palestinian gunmen kidnapped an Egyptian diplomat. The kidnapping was the most serious attack against diplomats in Gaza since a United States diplomatic convoy was hit by a roadside bomb in October 2003, killing three security guards. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin on Tuesday defended Russia's handling of natural gas disputes with Ukraine and Georgia, boasted of a new strategic weapon and defended the country's contribution to the Group of 8 in response to suggestions from some critics at home and abroad that his policies have disqualified it from the club of elite democratic nations. </p> <p> ''Everybody wants Russia to join the club and take an active part in its work because nobody wants the G-8 to turn into a gathering of fat cats,'' Mr. Putin said. He argued that Russia, comparatively poor though making economic gains, understood ''the problem facing developing countries better than anyone else in the G-8.'' </p> <p> Boris A. Berezovsky, a self-exiled Russian tycoon, said Friday that he would sell his remaining business interests to a partner, to free them from what he called unrelenting political pressure from the Kremlin. </p> <p> Mr. Berezovsky, at one time Russia's richest man, is wanted by Russian authorities, who accuse him of fraud and other offenses. He has been living in Britain, where he was granted political asylum. Mr. Berezovsky said his partner, Badri Patarkatsishvili, a Georgian citizen who is also wanted in Russia, would buy him out, though Mr. Berezovsky did not say for how much. </p> <p> France on Friday endorsed Russia's decision to hold talks on the Middle East conflict with Hamas, the radical Islamist Palestinian group, saying the discussion ''can contribute to advancing our positions.'' </p> <p> Other European countries distanced themselves from the French statement, which appeared to be in defiance of the American and European view that Hamas is a terrorist organization and therefore should not be officially recognized. Israel condemned it. But the United States took a more cautious approach. </p> <p> Finance ministers from the Group of 8 industrialized nations arrived Friday on a frosty, sunny day for a weekend meeting that is sure to revive doubts on Russia's membership in the club. </p> <p> For the first time, Russia, which holds the chairmanship this year, will be the host of the meeting of the G-8, whose other members are Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States, Canada and Japan. </p> <p> A roof laden with snow collapsed over a vegetable market in an outer district of Moscow early Thursday, killing at least 56 people, mostly young men from Central Asia and the Caucasus who worked as laborers and produce traders. </p> <p> The roof came down on the Basmanny Market, one of the Moscow area's largest, around 5:20 a.m., before the market opened for retail sales but while some wholesale buyers from restaurants and grocery stores were inside, survivors said. </p> <p> A consortium of Western banks led by Société Générale of France filed suit in Moscow Friday seeking to have the Yukos Oil Company declared bankrupt just over a year after the Kremlin seized its largest production asset in a politically tinged tax dispute. </p> <p> Adding to the turmoil at Yukos, the company's managers in Moscow openly defied orders this week from senior managers in self-imposed exile in London, raising concerns over whether the unusual arrangement could continue. The company's former chairman, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, is serving an eight-year sentence in a Siberian penal colony for fraud, embezzlement and tax evasion. </p> <p> President Bush said Wednesday that it would be a mistake for the United States to boycott the Group of 8 meeting in Russia this summer. </p> <p> He also said he needed a personal relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia so he could walk into a room with him and have him ''not throw me out.'' </p> <p> Here in the Caucasus, above Sochi, Russia's only subtropical city, an elite ski resort is rising beside the Layura River. The resort, a multimillion-dollar project with a hotel and conference center, cottages, six lifts and miles of trails, is a centerpiece of Sochi's improbable bid for the Winter Olympic Games of 2014. </p> <p> Even more improbable is the project's developer: Russia's state gas monopoly, Gazprom. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin ordered Wednesday that an oil pipeline being built across Siberia be rerouted away from the northern shore of Lake Baikal, one of the world's natural landmarks. </p> <p> Mr. Putin's edict reversed a controversial government decision last month to allow Russia's pipeline monopoly, Transneft, to build the line within a half mile of Lake Baikal, the world's most voluminous body of fresh water. </p> <p> The authorities in St. Petersburg announced Wednesday that they had broken up an extremist group that had shocked Russia with a string of racially motivated killings, including that of an African student in April and of an expert on hate crimes nearly two years ago. </p> <p> The authorities said they recently arrested five members of the loosely organized group. Two others appeared to have been arrested earlier on separate charges, while an eighth was shot to death as the police tried to arrest him last Thursday. The police seized weapons, explosives and neo-Nazi and other extremist literature in raids of the gang members' apartments, the authorities said. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin fired the head of the customs service and a dozen or so midlevel security agency officials on Friday, ostensibly part of an anticorruption sweep of the Russian bureaucracy but moves that also undermined a pro-Western member of his cabinet. </p> <p> Officials caught up in the mini-purge were accused of smuggling cars, wine and even yachts to Russia, or skimming the billions of dollars in duties collected in Russia's import-dependent economy. </p> <p> SINCE my daughter Maya was born 10 months ago, I've noted that many of my Russian friends are more likely to express amazement than to share my joy. ''Do you really like fussing around with kids?'' asked one of them, a television journalist, with sincere incredulity. </p> <p> It might be that this notion of children as a burden, as an unnecessary bother, is the psychological reason for the catastrophic decline in Russian birth rates (the average woman has 1.34 children, and for every 16 Russians who died in 2004, only 10.4 babies were born). It's hard enough to get by -- let's leave children for the future. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin on Friday appointed the chief prosecutor he dismissed three weeks ago to be Russia's new justice minister. The decision suggested that the prosecutor's removal was less of a drastic shake-up than officials close to the Kremlin initially claimed. </p> <p> The former prosecutor, Vladimir V. Ustinov, was dismissed on June 3 in the midst of a wave of arrests and dismissals that officials and commentators described as a vigorous new assault on corruption -- one that Mr. Ustinov was both accused of hindering and credited for leading. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin on Wednesday ordered Russia's secret services to find and kill those who kidnapped and killed four Russian Embassy employees in Iraq, the Kremlin announced in a statement. </p> <p> The bluntness of the statement reflected the deep shock and anger -- much directed at the United States -- that have unfolded in Russia after the kidnapping on June 3 in an attack that killed a fifth Russian. </p> <p> For wine drinkers here, things were bad enough when the authorities banned imports from Georgia and Moldova in the spring, but one could get by with other imports that were -- no offense -- better. Things are about to get worse. </p> <p> In the last few days, wines from France, Italy, the United States and everywhere else have started disappearing from shops, supermarkets and restaurants. So have the whiskeys of Scotland and Ireland, the gins of England, the tequilas of Mexico. The reason is neither panic buying (though that would be in order) nor an unexpected appearance of Russian teetotalism, but rather a new federal excise law that has bottles flying off the shelves in a way no one intended. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin has dismissed Russia's chief prosecutor, who only a week ago promised to disclose new ''high-profile criminal cases'' involving government corruption, officials said Friday. </p> <p> The dismissal, ordered on Thursday and approved by legislators on Friday, was unexpected and, as is typical for the Kremlin, largely unexplained. It prompted a flurry of speculation about Mr. Putin's motives. </p> <p> Shortly before Christmas, the White House received some strange and decidedly awkward news out of Moscow. </p> <p> A Russian oil company was courting one of President Bush's closest friends, former Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans, to be its chairman. Even more surprising was that President Vladimir V. Putin personally delivered the job offer. </p> <p> Deep beneath the thick forests of Siberia, near Lake Baikal, lies a vast deposit of natural gas known as Kovykta, a field so large it could supply all the United States' needs for three years. </p> <p> But Russia has so far refused to allow the private companies developing the field to build a pipeline to export the gas. Instead, the only customer is a tiny neighboring logging town happy to replace its soot-belching, coal-fired power with gas. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin took an acerbic jab at the White House on Wednesday, likening a speech by Vice President Dick Cheney criticizing Russian policy to Mr. Cheney's much publicized hunting accident in February. </p> <p> Mr. Putin was asked about a strong rebuke, delivered May 4 by Mr. Cheney in Lithuania, a former Soviet republic, in which the vice president said the government in Moscow ''unfairly and improperly restricted'' people's rights, and suggested that the Kremlin sought to use the country's vast resources of oil and gas as tools to intimidate its neighbors. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin awarded medals to members of the former K.G.B. on Thursday for what the Kremlin said was their role in the killing of the terrorist leader Shamil Basayev this month. </p> <p> The ceremony, held behind closed doors, took place even as questions swirled about Mr. Basayev's death, which has become the latest of Russia's public mysteries. </p> <p> WHEN observing the West's conciliatory dealings with Russia, I'm reminded of a quotation often attributed to Winston Churchill: ''However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.'' </p> <p> For five years, President Bush has been talking about maintaining an open dialogue with Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, and about how hard he has worked to convince the Russian leader that ''it's in his interest to adopt Western-style values and universal values.'' This sounds reasonable, but we don't have to go on theory. There's a track record -- one that clearly shows that persuasion and appeasement toward Russia have failed. </p> <p> Cherie Blair, the wife of Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, on Monday stepped into the debate over Kremlin pressures on Russian civil society, offering legal assistance to human rights and aid groups to challenge a disputed new law, members of the organizations said. </p> <p> The offer by Ms. Blair, a human rights lawyer, came at the end of the Group of 8 summit meeting here, during which President Bush and Mr. Blair tried to balance their shared interests with Russia and their concerns over President Vladimir V. Putin's authoritarian tilt. </p> <p> The Russian security officers, in plain clothes, arrived in the late afternoon at a hotel where a pro-democracy conference was being held, witnesses said. </p> <p> They swiftly seized four members of a political movement opposed to President Vladimir V. Putin, handcuffed them and rushed them away. Then they turned on a German magazine correspondent who tried to photograph the arrests. One of the officers snatched his camera and left with it, too. </p> <p> President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Saturday will announce a new global program to track potential nuclear terrorists, detect and lock up bomb-making materials and coordinate their responses if terrorists obtain a weapon, according to administration officials who have negotiated the deal. </p> <p> Within months, the officials said, they expect China, Japan, the major European powers, Kazakhstan and Australia to form the initial group of nations under what the two leaders are calling ''The Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism.'' The informal organization of countries is based on the American-led ''Proliferation Security Initiative,'' a group of more than 70 countries that have pledged to help seize illicit weapons as they move across oceans or are transported by air. Some countries in that group now hold regular drills to share intelligence and practice seizures. </p> <p> President Bush met with some of President Vladimir V. Putin's most persistent critics upon arriving here Friday, in a signal of concern to his uneasy ally about the tenuous state of Russian democracy. </p> <p> The meeting came just hours before the two and their wives dined together privately at the 1,000-room Konstantinovsky Palace in nearby Strelna, where Russia is to play host to the annual summit meeting of the world's largest economic powers starting Saturday. </p> <p> Shamil Basayev, the Chechen rebel who organized the deadliest terrorist attacks against Russia, was killed in an explosion early Monday, in what the director of the country's security service described as a special operation that began by tracking shipments of weapons and explosives from abroad. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin declared the death of the country's most wanted man -- who had a price of more than $10 million on his head -- in Ingushetia, a region on Chechnya's western border, a ''just retaliation'' for the bloodshed Mr. Basayev had caused. </p> <p> American-financed radio news broadcasts to Russia, a staple of the American government's outreach efforts since the cold war, have been sharply curtailed in recent months under legal pressure from the Russian government, according to Russian and American officials. </p> <p> The pressure has knocked programs off the air in much of the country, limiting the Russian-language news broadcasts of Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty almost entirely to Moscow and St. Petersburg. </p> <p> Were he still around, what would Peter the Great make of the Group of 8 summit meeting being held this weekend in his imperial capital? Would he find any kindred autocratic spirits among the leaders of the industrialized world as they confer in the grand palaces of St. Petersburg? For critics of George W. Bush and his expansive view of presidential power, the question answers itself, and Jacques Chirac certainly wins points for hauteur. But compared to other presidents making headlines lately (leaders chosen, more or less, by their own people) Bush and Chirac have been models of executive self-restraint. </p> <p> In a new case of cold-war-style espionage, Russia on Wednesday announced the conviction of a retired military officer who had pleaded guilty to charges that he passed state secrets to Britain for nearly a decade. </p> <p> The officer, identified as Col. Sergei V. Skripal, was sentenced to 13 years in prison for treason stemming from a collaboration with Britain's secret intelligence service, MI6, officials said in interviews and in statements to Russian news media. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia arrived in South Africa on Tuesday for a two-day state visit, the first for a Kremlin leader, that reunites two old ideological soulmates under a new banner: making money. </p> <p> Hours after landing in Cape Town and meeting with President Thabo Mbeki, Mr. Putin said at a news conference that Russia planned multibillion dollar investments in South Africa, signed a business cooperation agreement and announced a deal to extend sales of nuclear fuel and technology to South Africa's nascent nuclear power industry. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia dismissed concerns over his country's growing interest in the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company at a meeting here Saturday with his French and German counterparts. </p> <p> ''As far as the acquisition of a 5 percent stake is concerned, it is not at all evidence of aggressive behavior on the part of the Russian side,'' Mr. Putin told reporters after discussions with President Jacques Chirac of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany at Compiègne, north of Paris, that ranged from Russia's handling of its energy resources to such diplomatic issues as Lebanon and Iran. ''We will not use this stake to change in any way the institutional situation of EADS.'' </p> <p> Anna Politkovskaya, the veteran Russian journalist and author who made her name as a searing critic of the Kremlin and its policies in Chechnya, was found dead on Saturday in her apartment building, shot in the head with a pistol, the authorities and her colleagues said. </p> <p> Ms. Politkovskaya, 48, was a journalist with few equals in Russia. She was a special correspondent for the Novaya Gazeta newspaper and had become one of the country's most prominent human rights advocates. </p> <p> The mourners stood in the rain, which fell heavily at moments on Tuesday, fulfilling their part in a ritual of sadness and anger and, politically speaking, inconsequence, which has become strikingly common in Russia today. </p> <p> They gathered, in this case, on the western edge of Moscow for the funeral of Anna Politkovskaya, a tenacious, sometimes reckless, but always passionate journalist and human rights advocate, who died three days ago at the hands of, from all appearances, a professional killer. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin has a penchant for making pithy, acerbic, sometimes coarse comments. On Wednesday, a microphone inadvertently left on during a brief appearance with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel captured his views on the sex scandal involving Israel's president. </p> <p> According to journalists and officials in the room and published accounts by Agence France-Presse late Wednesday and Kommersant and The Jerusalem Post on Thursday, Mr. Putin was heard saying, ''Say hello to your president,'' to Mr. Olmert, referring to President Moshe Katsav, who could face criminal charges that he raped and assaulted two former employees. Mr. Putin added, ''He really surprised us.'' </p> <p> Russia announced Monday that it was suspending air, rail, sea and road links to its small southern neighbor, Georgia, taking its first significant retaliatory steps after last week's arrests by Georgia of four Russian military officers on accusations of espionage. </p> <p> Several hours after Russia suspended travel, as well as postal service, between the countries, Georgia released the four officers into the custody of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, an international body to which both countries belong that had helped negotiate the release. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin, a former spy who is still popular in Russia after six years in office, said Wednesday that he would continue to ''influence the life in our country'' after his second term is up in 2008, but that he would not run for president again. </p> <p> Mr. Putin said he would step down ''even though I like my work.'' Although a third consecutive term is forbidden under Russia's 1993 Constitution, his supporters have called for a referendum to do away with that ban. </p> <p> Could there be a better symbol for the new Moscow -- seductive, indulgent, awash in got-quick riches -- than the casino? </p> <p> There are more than 60 of them in the city now, neon palaces of capitalist glitter and risk that have become as ubiquitous as the onion domes of Russian Orthodoxy. One major street, Novy Arbat, has more than a passing resemblance to the Las Vegas Strip, and even a casino called the Mirage. </p> <p> The British police on Sunday sought to retrace the movements of Alexander V. Litvinenko, a former Russian secret agent, before he fell ill from the radiation poisoning that killed him last week. </p> <p> But the police insisted, as they have for several days, that Mr. Litvinenko's macabre death on Thursday remained in the ''suspicious'' category and that they were not at this time treating the case as a murder inquiry. </p> <p> Doctors in London remained uncertain yesterday what substance could have felled Alexander V. Litvinenko, a former K.G.B. operative seriously ill in an intensive care unit. Scotland Yard is investigating the case as a probable poisoning, and doctors are trying to learn how the substance was delivered. </p> <p> Although the London hospital has not released a full accounting of his illness, the doctors have indicated that he is suffering from gastrointestinal problems, hair loss, pain and failure of the bone marrow, the body's factory for producing blood and immune cells. </p> <p> Radiation poisoning killed Alexander V. Litvinenko, the former Russian K.G.B. officer and foe of the Kremlin, authorities here said Friday, further complicating a case that has taken on all the mystery and menace of a political thriller. </p> <p> From his deathbed, Mr. Litvinenko's family said, he had accused President Vladimir V. Putin of being behind his poisoning. Outside the hospital where he died late Thursday, alarm spread across London after the police found traces of radiation in three places the former spy had been: a sushi bar, a hotel and his North London home. </p> <p> A rental car agency in this capital of fast deals but snail-paced traffic advertised an unusual service for those with plenty of money but little time: rent-a-motorcade. </p> <p> Business Car Service promised to provide as an escort an actual police car and two traffic policemen for eight hours at a cost of only $900. The car is equipped with a siren and, most important, a flashing blue light to get you places fast. </p> <p> A Russian government agency said Thursday that it would test several passenger airplanes for traces of the radioactive isotope that killed Alexander V. Litvinenko last month in London, but officials at the state-controlled airline, Aeroflot, said the agency had told them there would be no inspections. </p> <p> The contradictory, perhaps confused, statements underscored the uncertain response of the Russian authorities in a murder case that the victim, without direct evidence, laid at the feet of President Vladimir V. Putin and the country's secretive security services. </p> <p> Perhaps the kindest thing to say about Gerhard Schröder's return to private life last year is that it was not as unseemly as that of his predecessor as German chancellor, Helmut Kohl. </p> <p> Mr. Kohl admitted he took illegal cash payments, leaving his reputation in tatters. Mr. Schröder, by contrast, took a job as chairman of the board of a Russian-German pipeline joint venture, and was roundly condemned by critics who said he had championed the pipeline while in office and improperly cashed in on his friendship with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. </p> <p> A Russian parliamentary commission on Friday issued its final report on the terrorist seizure of a public school in Beslan in 2004. The report briefly highlighted law enforcement mistakes but placed blame for the hundreds of deaths on the terrorists alone. </p> <p> The report's long-awaited conclusion, read aloud by the commission's chairman during a session of Parliament's upper house, ended more than two years of investigation into the worst terrorist act in post-Soviet Russian history. </p> <p> Seven bartenders at an upscale hotel in central London have tested positive for radioactive contamination, the British authorities said Thursday, raising new questions about the radiation poisoning death of Alexander V. Litvinenko, a former Russian agent. </p> <p> In Moscow, Russia said it had opened its own criminal investigation into the death of Mr. Litvinenko, who was buried Thursday, two weeks after he died, in a private ceremony in London. Russian authorities also said a Russian businessman, Dmitri V. Kovtun, who was interviewed by British investigators in Moscow, was found to have signs of radioactive poisoning. </p> <p> Just before Christmas, in a fancy Azeri restaurant in Moscow, the German Embassy arranged a meeting between journalists and representatives of two leading independent human rights groups. </p> <p> It was a timely occasion given that the Kremlin of President Vladimir V. Putin had tried to restrict the activities of nongovernmental organizations after successfully muzzling much of the news media. </p> <p> Russia's Prosecutor General's Office on Wednesday produced a startling new twist in the investigation of the killing of Alexander V. Litvinenko, the former K.G.B. officer who died in London in November of radiation poisoning. It announced that it was investigating the possible involvement of former executives of Yukos Oil, the company dismantled by a prosecutorial assault last year. </p> <p> In a statement released Wednesday evening, the prosecutor's office said its investigation indicated a link between the poisoning of Mr. Litvinenko and criminal cases under way against Yukos executives. It singled out Leonid B. Nevzlin, a major shareholder and partner of the company's jailed chief executive, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky. </p> <p> Karl Marx wrote that the state was nothing more than the executive committee of the bourgeoisie. But in Russia, President Vladimir Putin has stood Marx on his head: the state dominates many of the most important businesses, not the other way around. A new hybrid of country and corporation has been created, fusing the public and private sectors together to serve the Kremlin. Andrei Illarionov, who in December 2005 resigned as an economic adviser to Putin, calls it ''a corporate state.'' </p> <p> The investigation into the poisoning of Alexander V. Litvinenko, a former Russian K.G.B. operative, will likely broaden in coming days, Britain's highest ranking law enforcement officer said Sunday, and media reports said British counterterrorism officers were planning to fly to Moscow to interview witnesses. </p> <p> Mr. Litvinenko died Nov. 23 of radiation poisoning, and a radioactive isotope, polonium 210, was found in his urine. Since then, the investigation into his death has led the police along a trail of places where traces of radiation were found -- including British Airways airplanes flying to and from Moscow and several locations in central and north London. </p> <p> An unyielding President Vladimir V. Putin on Tuesday raised the possibility of diverting oil transit routes away from Belarus, a day after Moscow cut off pipeline deliveries of crude oil headed to customers in Eastern and Central Europe through the country. </p> <p> Such a change, which would be years in the making, would cut Belarus out of any role in the transshipment of oil to Europe without offering the customers any immediate assurance that their supplies were reliable. </p> <p> A new nuclear accord, booming trade and an ever closer partnership with the United States notwithstanding, the guest of honor this week at India's Republic Day ceremony, an annual display of military pomp, will be a symbol of New Delhi's newest old friend: President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. </p> <p> Mr. Putin's two-day visit to this country, starting Thursday, is his fourth since becoming president and is seen as testament to the enduring ties between India and Russia. Battered by the end of the cold war and challenged by India's warmer relations with the United States, those links have been revived by the strategic demands of a prospering India, namely energy and arms. In both areas Russia stands to be an important partner. </p> <p> India sealed a wide-ranging package of agreements with Russia on Thursday, the first day of a summit meeting intended to demonstrate that their longstanding relationship had not deteriorated as a result of India's growing engagement with the United States. </p> <p> In a joint statement issued after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia met with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India, Russia offered to build four new nuclear power plants in India, in addition to the two reactors it is already building here. </p> <p> New Year's has long been the favored holiday here, celebrated with Champagne and fireworks and gifts under the Christmas tree. Then there was Jan. 2, also traditionally a holiday. Now there is the 3rd and the 4th and the 5th. </p> <p> There is, in fact, not another official workday this year until Jan. 9, a protracted holiday break that began eight days ago. It seems like a deep breath, a really deep breath, before plunging into 2007. </p> <p> Russia's elite players came to the World Economic Forum high in the Swiss Alps with a mission. At a meeting as much about posturing and politics as it is about business and trade, Moscow's emissaries were here to say loudly that their country was not the bully its detractors depicted it to be. </p> <p> In truth, last year was a grim one for Russia's reputation, tarnished by the unsolved murders of Kremlin critics at home and abroad and by President Vladimir V. Putin's continued moves to tighten state control of economic and public life. </p> <p> Foreign policy experts are still trying to parse Vladimir Putin's weekend blast against America, which he described as a brutish country that ''has overstepped its national borders, in every area.'' But rather than asking what exactly motivated Mr. Putin to lash out at the U.S. in this way, the question we should be asking is: why do remarks like these play so well in Russia today? </p> <p> I've just returned from Moscow and I can tell you what analysts there told me, what even Russian liberals reminded me of: NATO expansion. We need to stop kidding ourselves. After the end of the cold war and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in 1991, the Bush I and Clinton administrations decided to build a new security alliance -- an expanded NATO -- and told Russia it could not be a member. </p> <p> Russia today is a country that takes three hands to describe. </p> <p> On the one hand, it is impossible any more to call Vladimir Putin's government ''democratic,'' given the way it has neutered the Russian Parliament, intimidated or taken over much of the Russian press, subordinated the judiciary and coercively extended its control over the country's key energy companies. </p> <p> Sergei B. Ivanov walked in late to the holiday performance of the army's Academy of Song and Dance. He sat in a seat saved for him between a mop-haired boy and a girl with a fluffy white ribbon in her hair. He watched, stiffly tapping his foot, as Soldier Ivan danced with fairies on his way to saving the children's New Year's presents from the old witch Baba Yaga. Grandfather Frost Russia's Santa Claus arrived in the end, of course, with gifts for the children in the audience, sons and daughters of Russia's military men. The soldier/actor's voice boomed as he introduced ''a very big present,'' ''our wonderful guest'': Ivanov, then the country's minister of defense (and soon to be named first deputy prime minister), the man who might well be the next president of Russia. </p> <p> Two candidates in local elections here in March, a soccer star and figure skating champion, have no known intention of giving up sports for legislative politics. If they win, as they almost certainly will, their Kremlin-friendly parties, not the voters, will choose the candidates to fill their seats. </p> <p> An opposition party was kicked off the ballot for forging signatures but given little chance to prove otherwise. Government-controlled television has effectively barred parties except those loyal to President Vladimir V. Putin from the airwaves. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia arrived Sunday night in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, for a visit intended to expand trade and military links between the nations, among the world's largest oil producers. </p> <p> The overnight visit was part of a three-day tour of the Middle East intended to bolster bilateral ties with major Arab countries. </p> <p> Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, disputing a lengthy critique of American power by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Saturday, said Sunday at a European security conference here, ''One cold war was quite enough.'' </p> <p> Government leaders, legislators and military officials here continued speculating on Mr. Putin's motivation for delivering his long list of complaints about American domination of global affairs, but Mr. Gates chose words of velvet, not steel, in offering Washington's fullest response. As Mr. Putin had, he invoked the cold war more than once. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin on Thursday added intrigue to the unsettled but widely debated question of who might succeed him as Russia's leader in 2008 when he promoted his minister of defense in an unexpected cabinet tinkering. </p> <p> Sergei B. Ivanov, a former K.G.B. officer who became the first civilian to lead the country's military in 2001, will now serve as a first deputy prime minister, giving him expanded duties. He will have the same rank in government and title as another closely watched contender, Dmitri A. Medvedev. </p> <p> Even as the United States intensifies its efforts to isolate Iran, President Vladimir V. Putin said Thursday that Russia would consider OPEC-like cooperation with Tehran on sales of natural gas. He stopped short of endorsing price fixing, however, saying he was concerned only with ensuring stable supplies for consuming nations. </p> <p> Mr. Putin reiterated Russia's opposition to Iran acquiring nuclear weapons, but his remarks underscored a widening rift with the United States and its allies over how to force Tehran to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia accused the United States on Saturday of provoking a new nuclear arms race by developing ballistic missile defenses, undermining international institutions and making the Middle East more unstable through its clumsy handling of the Iraq war. </p> <p> In an address to an international security conference, Mr. Putin dropped all diplomatic gloss to recite a long list of complaints about American domination of global affairs, including many of the themes that have strained relations between the Kremlin and the United States during his seven-year administration. </p> <p> A fire that swept through a home for the elderly and disabled in southern Russia killed at least 62 people early Tuesday, a toll that officials attributed to safety violations and a night watchman's negligence. Many of the dead were confined to their beds and unable to flee the smoke and flames, the officials said. </p> <p> The disaster comes on the heels of a mine explosion on Monday that killed more than 100 people and an airplane crash on Saturday in Samara, on the Volga River, that killed 7 and injured more than 20 of 57 aboard. The incident highlighted concerns about the state of Russia's buildings and industries, the laxity of safety standards and enforcement, and the strains on emergency rescue services, despite an economic boom fueled by rising oil and gas production. </p> <p> Here in Russia's third-largest city on Saturday, barely was a banner unfurled or an anti-Kremlin slogan chanted before a wave of heavily armored police officers engulfed a small group of demonstrators and journalists gathered for a protest against President Vladimir V. Putin's government. </p> <p> Protest organizers said about 200 marchers made it to Gorky Square in the city center before the police, wielding nightsticks, descended. About 10 elderly people yelling ''Fascists! Fascists!'' pressed their backs against the shields of a second wave of police officers but were knocked to the ground. After the initial police charge, most demonstrators melted into the crowd of onlookers, though the police herded about 30 people, including some foreign news photographers, into waiting buses. </p> <p> GARRY KASPAROV, the former world chess champion, took a pen and notebook and diagramed the protesters' march through St. Petersburg on March 3. Like a general reliving a battle or a player analyzing a winning combination, he sketched Uprising Square and showed where the police had gathered in strength, blocking the street leading to the governor's office. </p> <p> A tactical mistake! ''This is typical for this government,'' he explained. ''They protect themselves.'' </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin has ruled it out, and the Kremlin was quick to do so again on Friday, but the idea never quite dies: amending Russia's Constitution to allow Mr. Putin to extend his presidency beyond its legal end in 2008, now only a year away. </p> <p> The proposal seemed to gain new life when Sergei Mironov, the chairman of the upper house of Parliament, or Federation Council, proposed Friday not only to allow Mr. Putin to seek a third term but also to expand presidential terms to five or seven years from the current four. </p> <p> An unusually large and unruly protest against the government of President Vladimir V. Putin ended here Saturday in clashes with the police and the arrest of opposition leaders. Rally organizers and the police said more than 100 people were arrested after a midafternoon scuffle between marchers and riot police on the main street, Nevsky Prospekt, in the heart of the city's tourist district. St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city, is Mr. Putin's hometown. </p> <p> The rally was held in advance of local elections scheduled for March 11. Opposition events typically draw no more than several hundred people, but several thousand gathered for the rally in Vosstaniya Square. </p> <p> Riot police officers swarmed on a group of several dozen journalists and demonstrators on Saturday in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia's third-largest city, cutting off a protest against the government of President Vladimir V. Putin. </p> <p> The police, vastly outnumbering the protesters and wielding night sticks and metal shields, detained about 30 people, the Interfax agency quoted a spokesman as saying. A protest organizer said the number of people detained at the raid was more than 100, plus another 100 who had been arrested in an earlier roundup. Among those detained were several foreign and Russian journalists, including a photographer for The New York Times who was later released. </p> <p> Only a few visible traces of Yukos Oil remain in Nefteyugansk, a remote Siberian town so inseparable from Russia's energy wealth that it has neft, or oil, in its name. Here and there, workers' barracks, trucks and some aging equipment are still painted yellow and green, the color of Yukos's logo. </p> <p> The rest of what was once the most valuable subsidiary of the richest Russian company has new colors -- black and gold -- and a new owner, Rosneft. </p> <p> The Bush administration has decided to reach out more often and more intensively to Russia at a time when the leadership in Moscow is harshly criticizing American policy and some scholars say the United States has not sufficiently tended to an important relationship. </p> <p> Plans by the United States to base elements of a missile defense system in Eastern Europe, as well as Washington's support for expanding NATO, have compounded a sense of resentment within a Russian leadership emboldened by a flood of petrodollars. </p> <p> A methane gas explosion on Monday in a Siberian coal mine, in a region notorious for mine accidents, killed at least 78 people, and dozens were still trapped underground by late evening, emergency officials said. </p> <p> The explosion, one of the most deadly in recent years, occurred at the Ulyanovskaya coal mine in the city of Novokuznetsk, in south-central Russia, with about 200 people inside, said Valery B. Korchagin, a spokesman for the local emergency affairs ministry. Rescuers have pulled at least 83 survivors from the mine, 2 of whom were injured, he said. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Thursday appointed Ramzan A. Kadyrov, a widely feared young official whose security forces have been accused of kidnappings, torture and other abuses, to be president of Chechnya, the battered southern republic. </p> <p> The appointment, while expected, cemented Mr. Kadyrov's position as the dominant political figure in Chechnya, where Russian and Chechen forces have largely quashed a separatist movement after two wars, beginning in 1994. </p> <p> Boris A. Berezovsky, a self-exiled Russian tycoon, earned sharp rebukes from London and Moscow on Friday when he urged the forceful ouster of Vladimir V. Putin as president of Russia and a new revolution there. </p> <p> ''We need to use force to change this regime, because this regime is anticonstitutional,'' he said of Mr. Putin's government in an interview in the newspaper The Guardian on Friday. Asked if he was seeking to foment revolution, he declared, ''You are absolutely correct.'' </p> <p> Boris N. Yeltsin, Russia's first democratically elected president, was buried Wednesday after a somber, symbolic funeral service attended by Russia's political elite, current and former world leaders, family and close friends. </p> <p> The service was held in full accordance with Orthodox Christian tradition in the ornate Christ the Savior Cathedral, which was destroyed by the Soviet government in 1931, the year of Mr. Yeltsin's birth, and reconstructed with his approval. It was the first time since the death of Czar Aleksandr III in 1894 that the Orthodox church officially presided over the funeral of a head of state. </p> <p> Riot police officers dispersed an opposition rally in St. Petersburg on Sunday, rounding up and arresting protesters and their leaders in a chaotic street scene. </p> <p> The crackdown, on several hundred people who had gathered for an authorized rally but who then began an unauthorized march, followed a similar police action on Saturday in Moscow after a protest that attracted several thousand people. </p> <p> Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates pressed the Kremlin's top leaders on Monday to accept a detailed new plan for cooperation on missile defense in Europe that he said would make Russia a full partner in the American effort by sharing information, jointly developing new technology and even combining the two countries' defensive radar systems. </p> <p> The immediate answer from Russia's new defense minister, Anatoly E. Serdyukov, was a firm statement that the Kremlin had not dropped its strong opposition to American proposals for antimissile bases in Poland and the Czech Republic. </p> <p> AS I walked behind Boris Yeltsin's coffin at Novodevichy Cemetery on Wednesday, I found myself thinking about the man I worked with closely for nearly eight years and the role he played in changing the world, mostly for the better. </p> <p> Every time I met with him, Mr. Yeltsin left no doubt that he had two objectives above all others. The first was to make sure that the Russian people never again had to live under communism, or autocratic ultranationalism. The second was to form a solid, lasting partnership between a democratic Russia and the West. </p> <p> Garry Kasparov, the former chess champion turned opposition politician in Russia, was arrested with nearly 200 other protesters during a rally in Moscow on Saturday that ended in clashes with riot troops. </p> <p> The rally, the third so-called Dissenters' March held by a loose antigovernment coalition known as Other Russia, was noteworthy because authorities aggressively pursued the organizers, including President Vladimir V. Putin's former prime minister, Mikhail M. Kasyanov, whom the police jostled but did not arrest. Mr. Kasparov was later fined and released. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin said Thursday that Russia would suspend its compliance with a treaty on conventional arms in Europe that was forged at the end of the cold war, opening a fresh and intense dispute in the souring relations between NATO and the Kremlin. </p> <p> The announcement, made in Mr. Putin's annual address to Parliament, underscored the Kremlin's anger at the United States for proposing a new missile defense system in Europe, which the Bush administration insists is meant to counter potential threats from North Korea and Iran. </p> <p> Russia held a test launching of a new intercontinental ballistic missile on Tuesday and said it had successfully fired the weapon almost entirely across its northern airspace to the Russian Far East. </p> <p> The launching of the missile, which traveled more than 5,000 miles and was covered extensively on state television, occurred as President Vladimir V. Putin again chided the West for American-led plans to install an antimissile shield in Europe. </p> <p> Russia called Monday for an emergency meeting with the United States and European countries to discuss the future of a conventional arms treaty in Europe, which President Vladimir V. Putin suspended last month and has threatened to withdraw from altogether. </p> <p> The request for a meeting, which Russia asked to be held in mid-June, could be a step toward scuttling the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe, known as C.F.E. </p> <p> When Estonian authorities began removing a bronze statue of a World War II-era Soviet soldier from a park in this bustling Baltic seaport last month, they expected violent street protests by Estonians of Russian descent. </p> <p> They also knew from experience that ''if there are fights on the street, there are going to be fights on the Internet,'' said Hillar Aarelaid, the director of Estonia's Computer Emergency Response Team. After all, for people here the Internet is almost as vital as running water; it is used routinely to vote, file their taxes, and, with their cellphones, to shop or pay for parking. </p> <p> Russia agreed Tuesday to tone down the harsh language its senior officials have used against the United States in recent months, but the two countries remained at an impasse on several issues that have strained relations. </p> <p> The agreement to soften their public discourse was announced by the Kremlin after a meeting outside the capital between President Vladimir V. Putin and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and seemed to signal a restoration of state cordiality in the face of lingering disagreements. </p> <p> President Bush, under pressure from allies in Europe to be more forthcoming about his plans for basing missile interceptors in the region, said Monday that he was intensifying his efforts to persuade Russia to cooperate with the United States on the initiative ''so that they don't see us as an antagonistic force, but see us as a friendly force.'' </p> <p> Mr. Bush said he was trying to convince President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia that cooperation was ''in Russia's security interests,'' even though Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates did not win Mr. Putin's support during a trip to Moscow last week. </p> <p> Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Monday that while Russia and the United States were going through a period of uneasy relations, the problems fell far short of those of the cold war and that the two countries continued to cooperate in a number of important areas. </p> <p> ''Russia is not the Soviet Union, so this is not a U.S.-Soviet relationship,'' Ms. Rice said, speaking en route to Moscow and planned meetings with President Vladimir V. Putin and senior Russian officials. </p> <p> THE criticism by Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, of the United States and NATO put one in mind of an alpha dog at the junkyard gate -- tough, unrelenting, pugnacious. The trend started with his Feb. 10 speech in Munich, and in Moscow on April 26 his annual address to Parliament carried it forward. He railed against foreigners trying to change the economic and political system, even the culture, of the Russian Federation and called for a new law to prevent such imprecations. He also suspended Russian participation in a key arms control agreement, the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty. </p> <p> Russians are clearly frustrated with what they perceive to be a lack of respect for their concerns, especially regarding the proposed deployment of American missile defenses in Poland and the Czech Republic. But to insist that the United States and NATO are the enemy? The argument contradicts Russia's own interests, never mind that it has little link to reality. The cold war is, in fact, over. </p> <p> AS we all know, there is such a thing as a good idea whose time has not yet come. This adage can hold even for presidents of the United States. </p> <p> A case in point is the American proposal to establish a new ballistic missile defense site in Poland and the Czech Republic. The system -- which would complement the one established in recent years in California and Alaska -- is intended primarily to protect Europe and America from a missile launched from the Middle East. It is in principle a worthy idea, but the military benefits in the short term are not worth the worsening of relations with Russia that it has already engendered. </p> <p> The atmosphere was tense, laced with nearly a century of mistrust and bitter feelings, when President Vladimir V. Putin met in New York in 2003 with leaders of an émigré church that had broken with the Russian Orthodox Church after the Bolshevik Revolution. The breakaway church had vowed never to return as long as the ''godless regime'' was in power. </p> <p> ''I want to assure all of you,'' Mr. Putin said at the meeting, ''that this godless regime is no longer there.'' Then, recalled the Rev. Serafim Gan, a senior priest of the breakaway church, the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, he added, ''You are sitting with a believing president.'' </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin seemed to obliquely compare the foreign policy of the United States to the Third Reich in a speech on Wednesday commemorating the 62nd anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany. </p> <p> The comments were the latest in a series of sharply worded Russian criticisms of the foreign policy of the United States -- on Iraq, missile defense, NATO expansion and, more broadly, United States unilateralism in foreign affairs. </p> <p> Germany's relations with Russia were never likely to be as cozy under Angela Merkel as under her predecessor, Gerhard Schröder, who adopted a 3-year-old Russian girl and, on his 60th birthday, invited President Vladimir V. Putin home to celebrate. </p> <p> But Mrs. Merkel's tense exchanges with Mr. Putin over human rights and other contentious issues at a Europe-Russia summit meeting last week underscore how much has changed, at least in tone. </p> <p> The United States and Russia, with relations between them at their most contentious since the collapse of the Soviet Union, openly sparred here on Wednesday at a meeting of foreign ministers of the Group of 8 industrialized nations. </p> <p> The Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, accused the United States of starting a new arms race and implicitly threatened to veto any United Nations Security Council resolution that, like the one proposed by the United States and its European allies, would recognize the independence of Kosovo. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia brokered an agreement on Saturday with two Central Asian countries to build a new gas pipeline to Russia, delivering a major setback to continuing American efforts to send Central Asian natural gas exports directly to Europe. </p> <p> The presidents of Russia, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan agreed to build a new pipeline around the Caspian Sea, giving Russia significantly more control over much of Central Asia's vast natural gas reserves. Russia has its own bounty of natural gas, but the country's gas monopoly, Gazprom, has preferred to distribute subsidized domestic gas internally while reselling Central Asian gas to Europe at prices that are typically more than double what it is charged. </p> <p> The police detained more than a dozen opposition leaders and journalists here on Friday, preventing them from flying to a provincial city to take part in anti-Kremlin protests. The action followed a wave of harassment of the protest's organizers. </p> <p> The detentions added a new element of frostiness to President Vladimir V. Putin's meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and other leaders of the European Union near the city, Samara. </p> <p> The largest society of independent journalists in Russia, long critical of the Kremlin's curtailment of the independent news media, defied a government eviction notice on Friday, saying it would try to remain in its offices in spite of state pressure. </p> <p> The refusal by the society, the Russian Union of Journalists, to follow the government's order punctuated a day of resistance to a fresh round of crackdowns on the independent news media here. </p> <p> When President Bush declared last week that political openness naturally accompanied economic openness, his counterparts in Beijing and Moscow were not the only ones to object. Liberal and conservative intellectuals, even once ardent supporters, have backed away from the century-old theory that democracy and capitalism, like Paris Hilton and paparazzi, need each other to survive. </p> <p> From China, where astounding economic growth persists despite Communist Party rule, to Russia, where President Vladimir V. Putin has squelched opposition, to Venezuela, where dissent is silenced, developments around the world have been tearing jawbreaker-size holes in what has been a remarkably powerful idea, not only in academic circles but also in both Republican and Democratic administrations -- that capitalism and democracy are two sides of a coin. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin offered new suggestions on Friday for alternatives to a missile defense system in Europe, saying Russia would not object to American interceptor missiles in Iraq, Turkey or at sea, and proposing that Russia and the West study emerging missile threats jointly. </p> <p> Mr. Putin made his latest proposals hours after Azerbaijan said it was willing to discuss another Russian proposal, made Thursday, to use a Soviet-era early warning radar on its territory in the Caucasus as part of a missile defense system against Iran. </p> <p> The suspect in the fatal poisoning of Alexander V. Litvinenko, the former K.G.B. officer and Kremlin critic who died last year in Britain, said Thursday that Britain's foreign intelligence agency and a self-exiled Russian tycoon had organized the killing and framed him to create a political scandal. </p> <p> The suspect, the Russian businessman Andrei K. Lugovoi, also contended that British intelligence officers had tried to recruit him to collect compromising material about President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. </p> <p> A top Russia expert at the State Department issued an unusually sharp public criticism on Thursday of Moscow's behavior under President Vladimir V. Putin, describing the Kremlin as bullying its neighbors while silencing political opponents and suppressing individual rights at home. </p> <p> The comments, approved by the White House, are the latest volley of criticism between Washington and Moscow in recent days. Although the White House said this week that President Bush would play host to Mr. Putin on July 1 at the Bush family compound in Maine, the speech is likely to add tension at a time when the broader dialogue between Washington and Moscow is already taking the most caustic tones since the collapse of communism. </p> <p> President Bush delivered a two-pronged message to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Tuesday, two days before their scheduled meeting in Germany, chiding Mr. Putin for derailing democratic reforms while assuring the Russian leader that he had nothing to fear from a missile defense system in Europe. </p> <p> Mr. Bush issued the human rights rebuke on the first day of an eight-day swing through Europe, in a venue laden with symbolism: a conference on democracy co-led by the former Soviet dissident, Natan Sharansky. Democracy advocates and dissidents from 17 countries had gathered in Czernin Palace, in the very room where the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact was dissolved, to hear Mr. Bush speak. </p> <p> Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates made clear Thursday that the United States would not alter plans to deploy parts of a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic, despite an unexpected proposal by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to use a radar base in Azerbaijan instead. </p> <p> During a session of defense ministers here, Mr. Gates also effectively secured NATO's endorsement for an American plan to build the missile defense bases in Central Europe, overcoming the concerns of some alliance members that the effort could rupture relations with Russia. </p> <p> It was among the more shocking contract murders in recent years in Moscow, a city that has seen more than its share of such crimes. </p> <p> Men wielding pistols walked up to the first deputy chairman of the Russian Central Bank in a parking lot of a soccer stadium and shot him in the head. Andrei A. Kozlov, 41, died early the next morning. </p> <p> After months of angrily rejecting a White House plan for missile defense in Europe, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia surprised President Bush on Thursday with an offer to build a joint system in the former Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan. </p> <p> The proposed system, designed to guard against a missile attack from Iran, poses serious diplomatic and technical challenges, experts said. But the fact that it was suggested by Mr. Putin, and not immediately rejected by Mr. Bush, indicated a desire on both sides to cool the hostile exchanges that in recent months had driven relations to a low point in the post-cold-war era. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin said that Russia could benefit from longer presidential terms, though he again ruled out the possibility that he would remain in office after the expiration of his second term next year, according to remarks published Monday. </p> <p> The remarks, made in an interview with a group of invited journalists from Group of 8 countries at his residence outside Moscow on Friday, further clouded the situation around Mr. Putin's post-presidential plans and his possible successor. The Kremlin published the text of the interview at kremlin.ru/eng/. </p> <p> At a moment of rising tensions between Washington and Moscow, President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia appear likely to use a meeting in Germany this week to focus on the one area where they appear to share a common interest: slowing Iran's ability to produce nuclear fuel. </p> <p> On virtually everything else -- independence for Kosovo, missile defense and a sharp turn toward authoritarianism in Russia -- Mr. Bush's aides say they expect to have little leverage over Mr. Putin. Over the weekend, the Russian president threatened to once again point missiles at European targets if the United States went through with its plan to build a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic. </p> <p> In the belief that a free market in Russia requires a convertible currency as quickly as possible, President Boris N. Yeltsin's financial advisers are pushing to achieve this goal in the next few weeks -- over the objections of the Russian central bank and the doubts of the Bush Administration. </p> <p> The battle over convertible currency, which would greatly increase the country's attractiveness to foreign investors, is the most visible aspect of a larger struggle between those who want the Yeltsin Government to end numerous subsidies and payments to the people as quickly as possible, and those who favor a slower phasing out of Government supports. </p> <p> In the belief that a free market in Russia requires a convertible currency as quickly as possible, President Boris N.

"If we pull back, the agricultural sector has no other means of obtaining credit." </p> <p> Guns have always been Izhevsk's business, even when this city on the western edge of the Ural Mountains was a ramshackle outpost of the czar's empire. In 1947, the city produced the first AK-47 rifle, which became perhaps the world's most popular automatic and arguably one of the best known products of the Soviet Union's vaunted and secretive military-industrial complex. </p> <p> Today, nine months after officially opening its doors to the outside world, Izhevsk finds itself on the edge of an economic void. Military contracts, which once accounted for more than 70 percent of local production, have been cut back to practically nothing, leaving factories that produce guns, rockets, anti-aircraft systems and other sophisticated equipment to fend for themselves in an empty marketplace. </p> <p> The Bush Administration has quietly blocked the purchase of missiles, rocket engines, satellites, space reactors, spacecraft and other aerospace technology from the former Soviet Union, Federal and industry officials said last week. </p> <p> The Federal officials said their opposition to the purchases is part of an Administration policy intended to force the Russian space and military industry into such a decline that it poses no future threat to the United States. </p> <p> Although there has been much talk about building a new political order in the post-cold-war world, the events here in the last few days make clear that a new economic order is also rapidly emerging. </p> <p> Consider these developments in the whirlwind of high-level economic meetings in Washington: </p> <p> The United States pressed the United Nations Security Council today to impose an immediate and virtually total economic embargo, including a ban on all oil sales, on the rump Yugoslav Government in Belgrade to force it to end Serbian intervention in neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina. </p> <p> Britain, France and Belgium, the Council's three European Community members, accepted the American position in consultations at the Security Council today after favoring a weaker plan for imposing sanctions in stages. But Russia and China, two permanent Council members with veto power, which are also Serbia's principal oil suppliers, have appeared reluctant about sanctions. It was not certain that they would accept the embargo plan being pushed by Washington. Medicine and Food Are Exempt </p> <p> The sanctions the United States now wants are as comprehensive as those imposed on Iraq before the Persian Gulf war. They include a ban on trade, with the exception of medicine and approved supplies of food. An embargo on arms deliveries is already in effect. </p> <p> At least 13 of the 15 members of the United Nations Security Council, including Russia, appear ready to support tough economic sanctions against the Government of Yugoslavia when the issue comes to a vote on Saturday, diplomats said tonight. </p> <p> They said that after a day of consultations, it appeared that four of the five Security Council members with veto power would support the sanctions resolution drafted by the United States, and that the fifth, China, would abstain. </p> <p> In an eleventh-hour effort to head off mandatory Security Council sanctions, the leadership of the Serbian-led Yugoslav Government offered today to work with the United Nations to end the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to speed the flow of emergency relief supplies there. </p> <p> It also asked the 15-nation Security Council to send a delegation to visit the region in order to assess the situation and avoid what it described as "judgments based on assumptions rather than established facts." </p> <p> Rejecting last-minute Serbian appeals for a delay, the Security Council voted overwhelmingly today to follow the Bush Administration's lead and impose tough economic sanctions on the Yugoslav Government in an effort to force Belgrade try to bring peace to Bosnia and Herzegovina. </p> <p> In addition to calling for the establishment of a "security zone" around the Sarajevo airport to allow emergency supplies to be flown into the Bosnian capital, today's resolution committed the Council to "consider immediately, whenever necessary, further steps to achieve a peaceful solution in conformity with relevant resolutions of the Council."  [ Excerpts from the resolution, Page 8. ] U.S. to Seize Yugoslav Assets </p> <p> Although the resolution, which passed with 13 votes in favor and two abstentions, made no specific reference to using force, some Council members are informally discussing the possibility of a naval blockade of the Adriatic ports and closing Bosnian air space to Serbian planes that are supporting forces fighting there. In Sarajevo today, Bosnian Serbs and Muslim Slavs battled at an army barracks, but the Serbs were later reported to have ordered their troops to halt artillery fire.. </p> <p> In one of the largest joint ventures between a Western company and a former Soviet republic, the Chevron Corporation signed an agreement with Kazakhstan today that envisions producing 700,000 barrels of oil a day and revenues of more than $5 billion a year. </p> <p> The agreement, signed in Washington by President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, calls on Chevron to invest $10 billion over 40 years to develop the Tengiz oil field, one of the largest in the world. Russia Raises Fuel Prices </p> <p> In another move to increase oil production and exports, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia signed a resolution today raising the prices of oil and natural gas more than fivefold. The higher prices are expected to send new shock waves through the fragile Russian economy, where factories, farms and transportation have long relied on inexpensive fuel. </p> <p> Russia's vote to join United Nations sanctions against Serbia has set off a protest from right-wing nationalists in the Russian Parliament, who are accusing the Government of "betraying" their Slavic brothers and selling out to "pro-American interests" in Europe. </p> <p> Moscow's about-face on Yugoslavia has proved to be a litmus test not only of Russia's longstanding historical and cultural ties to Serbia, but also of the perception in some political circles here that Russia has had to fall in line behind the West's policy as the price for Western credits and aid. </p> <p> President Bush and President Boris N. Yeltsin flung open the door today to increased trade and investment, signing a package of commercial agreements that brush aside barricades put up during the cold war to block commerce between the United States and Russia. </p> <p> In a major trade development, the United States granted Russia most-favored-nation status in trade relations for the first time in more than four decades, giving it the same low tariffs that it gives other friendly nations. </p> <p> Of the many things that Russia lacks, peanut butter is one. To be sure, no one here knew they were missing it. But this week, in a gesture of self-interested humanitarian aid, the National Peanut Council of America presented this hungry nation with its first peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich. </p> <p> The formal tasting took place at the Exhibition of National Economic Achievements, a centerpiece of gilded fountains, giant airships and other monuments of the Soviet era. The first verdict by a troupe from the Moscow Children's Theater was that peanut butter -- or arakhisovoye maslo -- was "on the salty side." No one complained about it sticking to the roof of his mouth. </p> <p> The leaders of seven major industrial democracies warned the belligerents in Bosnia and Herzegovina today that they would support United Nations-backed military action if it became necessary to get aid through to civilians in Sarajevo and other parts of the war-torn country. </p> <p> The leaders issued a strong warning to the leaders of Serbia and of the armies it controls that further fighting was unacceptable. Resurgent nationalism and ethnic tensions there and in parts of the former Soviet Union, they said, were causing "death, destruction, and widespread dislocation of innocent people." </p> <p> Among Russia's giant state-owned manufacturing enterprises, the Volga Automobile Associated Works is one of the few that seem likely to survive and prosper in a market economy -- but not by selling cars to the many Russians who want them. The company's energies and money are focused instead on making cars for sale abroad. </p> <p> The concentration on exports is readily apparent at the auto works on the outskirts of this Volga River city. Western machinery packed in huge wooden crates sits outside a nearly finished building where parts will be made for a new model, one with the lines of a Ford Taurus, that the company hopes will be a big seller abroad. And a factory tour soon reveals that the company's top current export model is made with robots and computerized machine tools, while 20-year-old technology is used on cars sold to Russians. </p> <p> Desperate for hard currency, Russia offered yesterday to sell the United States tons of uranium from retired nuclear arms, saying the concentrated material could be diluted into fuel for civilian reactors that make electricity. </p> <p> Any East-West deal that turned nuclear swords into plowshares would be a milestone in dismantling the cold war's machinery. For the Russians, the main alternative is to store highly enriched uranium in underground bunkers. Some Western experts say they fear that material put in storage might eventually find its way back into bombs. </p> <p> The United States announced yesterday that it had agreed in principle to buy billions of dollars' worth of bomb-grade uranium from scrapped Soviet nuclear arms in an attempt to bolster the shaky Russian economy and to reduce the risks of nuclear accidents or theft. </p> <p> The agreement, which would require the formal approval of both Governments, calls for highly enriched uranium from Russian nuclear arms to be diluted for sale as commercial reactor fuel. It would be the first such agreement, and, if approved, would be a major step to reducing the dangers that made the cold war so unnerving. </p> <p> Federal officials say an East-West deal in which the United States would buy Russian uranium from scrapped nuclear arms involves far greater amounts than generally reported, at least 500 metric tons of highly enriched uranium. The purchased uranium is to be diluted for sale as commercial reactor fuel. </p> <p> The agreement was announced by the White House late on Monday, but its complete terms were not spelled out, leading to differing interpretations of its meaning. </p> <p> A Bush Administration official announced today that the United States was close to lending $2 billion to Russia for the purchase of American oil and gas production equipment, but legal and financial hurdles remain before any money can be disbursed. </p> <p> The money from the Export-Import Bank of the United States would allow Russia to buy badly needed spare parts and halt a steep decline in oil and gas output, said Eugene K. Lawson, the bank's acting chairman and president. The lack of spare parts has idled up to 36,000 oil wells in Russia, a fifth of the country's total, and hurt the country's ability to earn foreign currencies to pay for its economic changes, he said. </p> <p> As Bill Clinton prepares for inauguration, his Presidency already seems haunted by the great issue he pointedly avoided in the campaign -- national security and foreign policy. History will judge the Bush Administration's missed opportunities and neglect of a revolutionary world as an almost epic blunder, leaving a legacy of contradiction and hazard. </p> <p> Unless the new Administration develops a coherent view of a transformed world and of America's new international interest, role and purpose, there will be no more than a marginal, politically arbitrary reapportionment of huge national security budgets, which are now largely wasted on cold war vestiges yet are essential to finance domestic revival and deficit reduction. The same capricious politics are likely to raid non-military international spending or exploit trade tensions for short-run advantage, all with insidious effect. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration plans to make the modernization of the Russian oil industry a priority of the Energy Department under a program to aid American industry, stabilize world oil markets and assist Russian democracy by providing hard currency. </p> <p> That goal was one of a broad range of programs outlined by Hazel R. O'Leary, the nominee for Energy Secretary, in a written response to questions from the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. </p> <p> President Clinton declared today that having spent trillions of dollars to win the cold war, the United States must summon the will to spend much more than planned in Russia and the other former Soviet republics "to support democracy's success where Communism failed." </p> <p> Documents sent to Capitol Hill with the President's economic message last week, but little noticed at the time, indicated the President will ask for $700 million in aid next year for the former Soviet republics, nearly doubling the $417 million allotted for this year. Mr. Clinton, who plans to meet with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia on April 4, said "the world will suffer" if Russia's tottering economic reforms collapse.  [ Excerpts, page 6. ] Wants America to Compete </p> <p> In a speech at American University consciously evocative of one delivered there 30 years ago by John F. Kennedy, the President endorsed the broad thrust of former President George Bush's trade policies. But at the same time, he sent two signals of change with his call for greater support for Russia and a suggestion that he would demand progress on human rights as the price for continued growth in trade with China. </p> <p> Following is a transcript of the question-and-answer portion of President Clinton's first official news conference, held in the East Room of the White House today, as recorded by The New York Times: </p> <p> Q.  Mr. President, would you be willing to hold the summit meeting in Moscow if it would be best for President Yeltsin's political health? Have you spoken to President Yeltsin? And don't you think that if you did go through Moscow it would engage the U.S. too closely in the power struggle in the capital? </p> <p> President Clinton said today that he would support an emergency meeting of the major industrialized democracies to discuss how they can bolster the Russian democracy movement, adding that the group's next planned summit in July might be too long to wait. </p> <p> "The important point I'd like to make," Mr. Clinton said, after talks with President Francois Mitterrand of France, "is I don't believe we can wait until July for the major countries of the world, who care about what happens in Russia and who would like very much to keep political and economic reform on track there, to move." </p> <p> The President of Bosnia's Muslim-dominated Government agreed today to a plan to end the year-old war that has torn apart his country, and international mediators said later that the world must prepare to take tougher action against the Serbs, whose leadership in Bosnia still refuses to make peace. </p> <p> After a day of last-minute bargaining and delays, President Alija Izetbegovic approved a map dividing Bosnia and Herzegovina into 10 near-autonomous provinces and an amended plan for governing the country while a new constitution is drawn up. </p> <p> Russia's Foreign Minister said today that he was looking to the United States to put some substance into its protestations of support for Moscow at President Clinton's meeting next month with President Boris N. Yeltsin, not only through material aid but by making room for Russia in the international market for high technology and arms. </p> <p> Interviewed in the Stalinesque ministry building where he seemed to be working almost alone on a holiday weekend, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev said the United States could not sit back waiting for Russia to sort out its domestic problems but must rather "actively support the reformers" -- above all Mr. Yeltsin. </p> <p> The United Nations issued an emergency appeal for more food for Bosnia and Herzegovina today as five Security Council members raised the flag of revolt against the attempt by the United States and Russia to delay new sanctions against Serbia. </p> <p> In Geneva, Sadako Ogata, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, wrote to aid-giving governments expressing "deep alarm" at the shortage of food for the 2.8 million people now dependent on United Nations rations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. </p> <p> Vietnam provided American investigators with documents today that it says prove the fraudulence of a report found in Russia which suggests that hundreds of American prisoners of war were never freed. </p> <p> John W. Vessey Jr., a retired Army general who is President Clinton's envoy to Vietnam, said it was too early to assess the Vietnamese documents. But at a meeting with Hanoi officials, he warned that the report, a Russian translation of a 1972 Vietnamese document, appeared to be authentic and had "created very serious questions" about the fate of missing Americans. </p> <p> At Moscow's urging and with the support of the Clinton Administration, the Security Council today postponed voting new economic sanctions against the Yugoslav Serbs until after a referendum in Russia on April 25. </p> <p> The postponement is an effort to help President Boris N. Yeltsin win his struggle with the Russian Parliament. </p> <p> Despite its strong statements supporting new sanctions against the Serbs, the Clinton Administration bowed today to a Russian request that such a move be delayed to give Moscow more time to pressure the Serbs directly, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said. </p> <p> The United Nations Security Council delayed voting on sanctions until after Russia holds a referendum on April 25 on constitutional revisions. </p> <p> Underscoring the international community's problems in pushing through even modest measures to punish the Serbs for resisting a peace accord for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Russia refused today to accept a toughened set of American-sponsored sanctions against Belgrade. </p> <p> In a threat to Washington's hopes for a positive vote on the new sanctions at the United Nations on Monday, Russia told the Security Council that it cannot agree to their main points: seizing Yugoslav transport equipment, banning all ships entering Yugoslav waters and more strictly enforcing an existing trade embargo. </p> <p> Russia pressed tonight for further postponement of a Security Council vote planned for Monday on tightening the economic embargo against Yugoslavia, diplomats said. </p> <p> Consultations continued between Council members over sanctions that are intended to press what remains of Yugoslavia to use its influence to help end the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where Bosnian Serbs have been fighting Muslims and Croats for more than a year. One diplomat involved in the issue thought postponement of the vote was likely, but others said a final decision on whether to proceed with the new sanctions probably would be made on Monday. </p> <p> After a day of tense negotiations, the United Nations Security Council brushed aside a new cease-fire agreement in the battered Bosnian Muslim town of Srebrenica and voted late tonight to impose Draconian new sanctions on the rump Yugoslav federation of Serbia and Montenegro. </p> <p> Russia had fought hard to delay the vote until after the April 25 referendum on President Boris N. Yeltsin and his economic reforms because his nationalist opponents sympathize with the Serbs. But after hours of brinkmanship, Russia finally accepted defeat and abstained instead of using its Security Council veto to block the new sanctions. China also abstained.  'Total Isolation' </p> <p> But all 13 other Security Council members voted in favor of the punishing new sanctions, which France's representative, Jean Bernard Merimee, described as "the total economic and financial isolation of Serbia." </p> <p> After a day of tense negotiations, the United Nations Security Council brushed aside a new cease-fire agreement in the battered Bosnian Muslim town of Srebrenica and voted late tonight to impose Draconian new sanctions on the rump Yugoslav federation of Serbia and Montenegro. </p> <p> Russia had fought hard to delay the vote until after the April 25 referendum on President Boris N. Yeltsin and his economic reforms because his nationalist opponents sympathize with the Serbs.

Yeltsin and his economic reforms because his nationalist opponents sympathize with the Serbs. But after hours of brinkmanship, Russia finally accepted defeat and abstained instead of using its Security Council veto to block the new sanctions. China also abstained. </p> <p> President Clinton today threw his full political support behind Boris N. Yeltsin in Russia's fateful political struggle and pledged a larger-than-expected $1.6 million in assistance intended to show "immediate and tangible" support for Russia's reforms. </p> <p> "Mr. President, our nation will not stand on the sidelines when it comes to democracy in Russia," Mr. Clinton pledged in a statement that drew on Walt Whitman to bolster the President's insistence that it was the "high duty" of the world's democracies to rise to Russia's support. </p> <p> The Security Council is expected to hold an emergency session on Friday to consider imposing tough new sanctions on Yugoslavia immediately if the besieged Bosnian town of Srebrenica falls to Serbian forces. </p> <p> "I would definitely convene the Council, and I personally think we should move ahead immediately with the new sanctions," Jamsheed K. A. Marker of Pakistan, this month's Council president, said after reports that the Bosnian defenders of Srebrenica are negotiating the town's surrender. </p> <p> Despite all their reluctance to agree with the United States about military steps to stop the killing in the Balkans, what the European allies have really wanted from President Clinton is firm leadership now that he has consulted with them. </p> <p> More than one European diplomat has said in recent conversations that Mr. Clinton should stop asking them their opinion on what he plans to do and start telling them instead what he plans to go ahead with, preferably with their support. </p> <p> Secretary of State Warren Christopher will return home on Friday without winning an endorsement of President Clinton's proposal for the use of military force to curb Serbian aggression in Bosnia, despite the Bosnian Serbs' rejection of an international peace agreement. </p> <p> French, British and Russian leaders all agreed with Mr. Christopher's view that they must jointly take tougher action against the Bosnian Serbs. But none embraced what senior British and French officials described as the core of the American plan: the selective lifting of the United Nations arms embargo so that the United States and its allies can arm the Bosnian Muslim Government. </p> <p> The United States has imposed sanctions on Russian companies for selling missile technology in violation of international export controls, Clinton Administration officials said today. </p> <p> But the sanctions have been waived until mid-July while Washington and Moscow make a last-ditch effort to resolve their differences. </p> <p> Russia halted deliveries of natural gas to the Baltic state of Estonia today in a move seen as retribution for a new Estonian residency law condemned by Moscow as a form of ethnic "apartheid." </p> <p> Although Russian officials said the gas cutoff was because of a backlog of unpaid debts, the Estonian Prime Minister, Mart Laar, called the move a grave act that could lead to the closing of local factories, according to the news agency Baltfax. </p> <p> With their easy banter, upscale clothes and shared bottles of imported vodka, the large group of young Russians on the eight-hour Moscow-to-Vladivostok flight were obviously people who did this often. </p> <p> Halfway through the overnight flight, when most of his group had dozed off, Roman, the leader, agreed to explain who they were and what they did. It was a variation on a story often heard among Russian entrepreneurs trying to break out of the encrusted mold of socialism. </p> <p> The United States is trying to block the shipment of rocket-fuel ingredients from Russia to Libya, officials said today. The shipment is the latest in a string of exports that have caused major worry in the Clinton Administration. </p> <p> With a deteriorating economy, Russia has been increasingly dependent on military sales to earn hard currency. </p> <p> Japan's Foreign Minister, Kabun Muto, said today that a Clinton Administration proposal to create a $4 billion fund to help turn Russia's state-owned enterprises into private companies was "preposterous," and added that an agreement had been reached to scale the fund back to about $500 million. </p> <p> The proposal was made in April during a meeting here of the finance and foreign ministers of the Group of Seven industrial democracies. The meeting produced an agreement to provide $28 billion in aid to support Russia's transition to a capitalist economy, but the $4 billion fund was not part of that total. </p> <p> The United Nations agency overseeing the nuclear power industry called today for an independent international assessment of new evidence Russia has just given it suggesting one of the Chernobyl-type reactors that the major Western nations want shut down is safer than they think. </p> <p> In a statement here, the International Atomic Energy Agency called for "independent international verification" of the Russian assertions that were presented to a team of 20 nuclear experts from 10 Western countries while they were conducting an intensive examination of this "top of the line" 1,000-megawatt RBMK reactor at Smolensk earlier this month. </p> <p> With trade issues deadlocked and resistance building to American aid strategy for Russia just days before the economic summit meeting in Tokyo, the Clinton Administration has turned its attention to the group's political declaration as a way of making the meeting a success. </p> <p> "There's less progress on the economic side than the political side, so we're focusing on things we can control," a senior Administration official said. </p> <p> The Security Council today defeated a resolution, supported only by the United States and five nonaligned countries, that would have lifted the arms embargo against the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government. Britain, France and Russia abstained in a successful effort to defeat the measure. </p> <p> Six countries voted in favor of the resolution; the other nine members of the Council abstained. In order to pass, the resolution needed eight votes in favor. </p> <p> President Clinton and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa reached a major accord this morning on a hard-fought "framework" for resolving a series of mounting trade disputes between the two nations. Mr. Clinton said it committed Japan to bring about "a highly significant reduction" in Japan's huge trade surpluses with the United States and the world. </p> <p> The accord was announced after negotiations that lasted all night -- including a decisive 2 a.m. meeting in the President's hotel suite -- and hours after the Group of Seven summit meeting ended Friday, with Mr. Clinton declaring that his first major effort to create jobs through international trade negotiations had been a success. </p> <p> Following are excerpts from President Clinton's news conference yesterday in Tokyo after the 19th summit meeting by the Group of Seven industrial nations, as recorded by the Associated Press: STATEMENT </p> <p> The summit we have concluded sends a message of hope to America and to the world. </p> <p> From $30,000 Cartier watches to $150,000 stretch limousines, there is a brisk business to be done in Moscow these days catering to the gaudy and gargantuan appetites of Russia's new rich. </p> <p> At the Escada shop on the second floor of the old State Department Store, known as GUM, across Red Square from the Kremlin, young women breeze through racks of $2,000 suits without even a grimace. At the Almaz Jewelry Store on Kutuzovsky Prospekt, less expensive Cartier watches, priced at about $6,000, sell out as fast they are shipped in. </p> <p> Arriving at the economic summit meeting as leaders of the seven leading industrial nations were preparing a new aid package for his country, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia offered unusually conciliatory words today in an effort to warm decades of icy relations with Japan. </p> <p> The financial package, announced as a near certainty late today by Treasury Secretary Lloyd M. Bentsen, includes funds for training, grants and loans to help put Russia's state-owned companies into private hands. </p> <p> Leaders of the world's seven major industrial democracies agreed today to provide an immediate $3 billion in aid to Russia and pledged to push for economic growth and lower trade barriers. </p> <p> The leaders also agreed to send senior officials to the United States this fall for what Administration officials have described as a "jobs summit" that would address the problem of unemployment that persists even when economies are growing. </p> <p> Concerned that infectious diseases like hepatitis and AIDS can be spread by tissue transplants, the Food and Drug Administration will seek expanded authority to regulate bone, skin, cornea and other human tissue used for more than 400,000 transplants a year. </p> <p> Federal health officials and spokesmen for the growing tissue transplant industry say the transplants, which also include blood vessels, tendons, ligaments, cartilage and heart valves, are generally safe and have rarely been the cause of infectious disease. </p> <p> Russia has threatened to use its Security Council veto to block new sanctions that the United States, Britain and France want to impose on Libya for refusing to hand over two citizens accused of blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 in December 1988, United Nations diplomats say. </p> <p> The strongly worded threat, made in a letter to Secretary of State Warren Christopher that arrived last weekend, surprised and angered Administration officials. A total of 270 people died in the blast over Lockerbie, Scotland. </p> <p> Russia is threatening to veto new Security Council sanctions against Libya for refusing to surrender two suspects in the bombing of a Pan American World Airlines airliner over Scotland five years ago unless the United States, Britain and France give it an interest-free loan to cover a $4 billion debt Tripoli owes it. </p> <p> The United States and its allies are resisting the Russian demand, which one American diplomat described as "a nonstarter." </p> <p> The United States, Britain and France have warned President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia that relations between their countries will suffer if Moscow continues to block plans for new sanctions against Libya over its refusal to extradite two men accused in the bombing of a Pan American World Airways jet over Scotland five years ago. </p> <p> President Clinton and Prime Ministers John Major of Britain and Edouard Balladur of France sent separate messages to Mr. Yeltsin this week conveying this warning and saying that public opinion in their countries demands additional measures against Libya over the Pan Am bombing, in which 271 people were killed, diplomats here say. </p> <p> This is the coldest autumn here in 50 years, and Ukrainians are beginning to feel it indoors as well as out. Throughout the country, apartments and offices are getting colder, hot water is running out and brownouts are more common. </p> <p> Temperatures have already dipped to 8 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, and even the Parliament building is freezing inside. At many factories, like Gostomel Glass Works outside Kiev, workers on the assembly lines dress in thick parkas, fur hats and gloves. </p> <p> The United States warned Libya today that it may face a global boycott of its oil if it does not hand over suspected terrorists. The warning came after Russia, under Western pressure, dropped its objections to a new set of Security Council sanctions against the North African oil-producing country. </p> <p> American officials said the Administration would press for a total oil boycott if the new limited trade and financial embargo just worked out between the United States, Britain, France and Russia does not prompt Libya to surrender the two suspects indicted in the bombing of Pan American World Airlines Flight 103, which exploded over Scotland five years ago with the loss of 270 lives. </p> <p> The Administration announced today that Russia had agreed to allow the sale of virtually all drugs made in the United States and approved by the Food and Drug Administration. </p> <p> The agreement, which takes effect immediately, was described by the F.D.A. as the first in which any nation has formally agreed to rely so heavily on another nation to insure that drugs sold are safe and effective. </p> <p> Russian officials reportedly complained last November that State Department officials were discouraging them from releasing documents about prisoners of war in Vietnam. The report came in a classified cable made available today by Administration officials angry over President Clinton's decision to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam. </p> <p> According to the cable, the Russians said they were receiving a mixed message from Washington: while many American officials were pressing them to turn over as many documents as possible about the missing, others were saying that releasing such documents would hurt relations. </p> <p> Ukraine has ruled out handing over its share of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia as part payment of a mounting debt for oil and gas, the commander of the Ukrainian Navy said in an interview last week. </p> <p> Six months ago, the barter looked like a promising resolution to two of the most irksome issues between Russia and Ukraine. It emerged after September talks between President Boris N. Yeltsin and President Leonid M. Kravchuk in Massandra on the Black Sea. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration announced today that it was scrapping virtually all export controls imposed during the cold war on shipments of telecommunications equipment and computers to China, and to Russia and most other former Soviet bloc countries. The move is expected to open a market worth roughly $150 billion over the next decade. </p> <p> Administration officials said that stringent export controls would be kept on complex supercomputers and material that could be used in making nuclear bombs and other weapons of mass destruction. </p> <p> As Russia's natural-gas company announced a further deep cut in supplies to Ukraine over the weekend, President Leonid M. Kravchuk suggested that the move could derail the deal to give up his country's large nuclear arsenal. </p> <p> Speaking to the television of the Commonwealth of Independent States from Washington on Saturday night, Mr. Kravchuk said: "Fulfillment of all agreements, including agreements on nuclear commitments, is possible only if the economy works. If tomorrow factories come to a halt in Ukraine, and this is a reality if there is no gas, what carrying out of commitments can be spoken of?" </p> <p> The State Department said today that some Nigerians, with the help of their Government, have created global drug trafficking networks in Europe and Asia that officials estimate provide 35 percent to 40 percent of the heroin that enters the United States. </p> <p> The report, an annual world survey of drug cultivation and trafficking, also describes a dramatic expansion of Russian criminal groups involved in smuggling and distributing heroin from Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran, where heroin production continues to increase. </p> <p> President Clinton today approved a proposal for the wider use of NATO air power to protect Gorazde and other United Nations-designated "safe areas" in Bosnia and Herzegovina, senior Administration officials said. They said the President had directed his advisers to begin consulting immediately with European allies. </p> <p> The United States will also explore ways to tighten economic sanctions against Serbia, which is supplying the Bosnian Serbs who are threatening Gorazde, the officials added. The harder look at sanctions comes even as the Russians and Europeans are calling for a meeting with the United States and the United Nations on a timetable for eventually lifting them. </p> <p> In a move bound to increase concern in the West about Russian neo-imperialism, the Prime Ministers of Russia and Belarus signed a treaty today to unify their monetary systems and lift customs barriers. </p> <p> In a set of agreements that will be carried out in stages, Belarus will give up the right to control its money supply, handing over all monetary and credit controls to the Russian Central Bank. Russia will also receive a free lease on military bases for its troops. </p> <p> Russia formally joined the United States and the European Union today in a reinvigorated international effort to end the two-year-old war in Bosnia, supporting a plan that calls on the Bosnian Serbs to cede nearly a third of the land they control to the Muslim-dominated Bosnian Government. </p> <p> Under the plan backed today, that Government, now federated with the Bosnian Croats, would be given control of 51 percent of the country, while the Bosnian Serbs, who now control more than 70 percent, would receive 49 percent. </p> <p> In a nation brimming with advanced technology but sorely lacking in business acumen, one of the old Soviet Union's most impressive legacies, its space program, is shaping up to be one of the new Russia's rare economic success stories. </p> <p> Unquestioned in their technological prowess, Russia's rocket and satellite makers and other space-oriented enterprises have also displayed a surprisingly deft capitalist touch in forging ties with Western partners and finding new markets for their products around the world. </p> <p> The United States has decided to support a European strategy for ending the war in Bosnia that envisions possible punitive steps against either warring party that does not accept an emerging peace plan, senior American and French officials said today. </p> <p> President Clinton told the French Prime Minister, Edouard Balladur, in a meeting on Tuesday that it was important for American, Western European and Russian negotiators to work as one to complete a map dividing the country, present it to the Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-Croatian federation based in Sarajevo, and make clear that there would be consequences if either side rejected it, the officials said. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin pressed his campaign for closer Western ties today at the European Union summit meeting, concluding an agreement that is intended to free up trade with member countries and bring his vast, struggling land closer to rich Western economies. </p> <p> The signing ceremony, and others formally inviting four new members to join the union, took place on the grounds of Corfu's Venetian fortress in the neo-classical Chapel of St. George, overlooking the Ionian Sea. </p> <p> Complaining that Washington has again neglected to consult adequately with Moscow on a vital issue of international security, Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev refused today to support a Security Council resolution drafted by the United States that would impose sanctions on North Korea. </p> <p> It was the second time this week that Mr. Kozyrev had lashed out at the United States. On Tuesday, he warned Congress that its vote to end the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government could ignite "a new world war." </p> <p> North Korea deepened its confrontation with the United Nations and the Clinton Administration late Monday, announcing that it would immediately withdraw from the International Atomic Energy Agency and that the agency's inspectors would no longer be allowed in the country. </p> <p> The declaration would appear to mean that the two inspectors in North Korea will be expelled, but the statement did not explicitly refer to them. Without inspectors present, the spent fuel rods extracted from North Korea's largest nuclear reactor during the last month could be converted into weapons fuel without detection. </p> <p> An unusual trade agreement in which the United States has tried to cement good relations with Russia and stabilize the Yeltsin Government is under siege. The uproar is a lesson in what happens when noble foreign-policy goals clash with rigid trade laws that were constructed to protect American industry. </p> <p> The agreement, signed in March, allowed the Russians to export to the United States far more uranium fuel for nuclear power plants at a far lower price than would normally be allowed under American trade laws. At the same time it required that the Russians pay American uranium producers a subsidy to compensate for the falling price caused by the exports. </p> <p> In the face of renewed attacks by Bosnian Serbs on Muslim enclaves and United Nations peacekeepers, the United States is pressing for quick retaliation, American and European officials said today. </p> <p> Secretary of State Warren Christopher is scheduled to meet in Geneva on Saturday with the Foreign Ministers of Britain, France, Germany and Russia, and  is expected to urge tighter economic sanctions and stricter enforcement of United Nations-designated safe areas. </p> <p> The United States, Russia and the European Union agreed today to seek fresh economic sanctions against Serbia in reprisal for the Bosnian Serbs' rejection of their peace plan last week. But apparently wary of risking their own fragile  unity, the powers shied away from tougher measures like a renewed threat of NATO air strikes. </p> <p> After a six-hour meeting here, Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the  Foreign Ministers of Britain, France, Germany and Russia defended their decision as consistent with a step-by-step approach aimed at persuading the leadership of the Bosnian Serbs to accept the proposed territorial division of Bosnia. Serbia  is the main supporter of the Bosnian Serbs, and the new sanctions are intended to make Belgrade press its Bosnian allies to agree to the plan. </p> <p> At a bustling little market on the edge of the diplomatic enclave, foreign window shoppers and serious buyers in sunglasses, shorts and T-shirts stroll in the summer heat, glancing at signs in Russian. </p> <p> This is the Yashwant Place Shopping Center, better known as Little Russia, where Indian storekeepers speak fluent Russian. Even the menus at the tiny Tibetan restaurants are in Russian. </p> <p> Even as the Administration tries in talks with Cuba to put one crisis to rest, senior aides to President Clinton say he faces more troubles abroad this fall, with tensions over Bosnia about to jump back to center stage. </p> <p> The officials say they harbor no illusion that the forces that have pulled the United States toward a more prominent role in Bosnia can be kept dormant much longer. They cite a volatile mix of Serbian stubbornness in resisting peace plans, Russia's independence in easing its pressure on the Serbs and a desire in Congress to end the arms embargo on the Bosnian Government -- all of which could increase the pressure for American action, pressure that will only intensify as the November elections near. </p> <p> After the President has addressed the nation about his need to make good on his stream of threats to the Haitian junta; after partisans in Congress do their mutual somersaults on the War Powers Act; after we hail a victory over a pipsqueak principality in a war of nerves or forces -- then a real foreign-policy crisis will have to be faced. </p> <p> The Bosnian clock now stands at one month to midnight. Being put to the test is the credibility of NATO and the strength of the new relationship between the U.S. and Russia. </p> <p> In a new sign of division over the path to peace in Bosnia, Russia has issued a strong private message to President Clinton warning him not to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government, Administration officials said today. </p> <p> Mr. Clinton said last month that he would press for a lifting of the embargo if the Bosnian Serbs had not accepted a peace settlement drafted by the Western allies and Russia by Oct. 15. The embargo bars arms shipments to all sides in the conflict, but hurts the Bosnian Government most because the Bosnian Serbs are much better armed. </p> <p> In a good-will gesture for a summit meeting with Russia next week, President Clinton signed a declaration today that frees the former Soviet state from one of the central political weapons of the cold war, a law tying trade conditions to emigration, senior Administration officials said. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, who will meet with Mr. Clinton in Washington next week, had contended that his country remained unfairly burdened by the 20-year-old American law, known as the Jackson-Vanik amendment, which was intended to embarrass Moscow for policies that made it difficult for Jews to emigrate. </p> <p> As he prepared to address the United Nations and got ready for a two-day meeting with President Boris N. Yeltsin, President Clinton began to search yesterday for a way out of a promise that threatens to divide the United States from Russia and other allies over efforts toward Bosnia. </p> <p> In an afternoon meeting with President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia, Mr. Clinton began to explore whether the Bosnian Government might be satisfied with a plan that would delay his pledge to seek United Nations approval for a lifting of the arms embargo against his Muslim-dominated forces if the Serbs did not agree to an American-backed peace agreement by Oct. 15. </p> <p> As President Saddam Hussein pulled back most of his troops from the border with Kuwait, the United States sought allied support today for a plan that would require Iraq to permanently withdraw its better-equipped Republican Guards but would allow 50,000 regular Army troops to remain in the area. </p> <p> The proposal was less sweeping than an idea suggested on Monday by Defense Secretary William J. Perry: a huge demilitarized zone that would have excluded all tanks and heavy artillery and left Mr. Hussein with virtually no military control over the southern part of his country. </p> <p> As the United States lobbied hard for a new Security Council resolution to deter Iraq from repeating its recent threatening military moves, Iraq and Russia announced tonight in Baghdad that they had reached an agreement that would lead to Iraqi recognition of Kuwait. </p> <p> The Iraqi concession, which would also recognize Kuwait's borders as demarcated by the United Nations, would be linked to the lifting of some of the international sanctions now imposed on Iraq within six months. </p> <p> Iraqi officials said today that Iraq has no intention of attacking Kuwait and that neither the Iraqi Army nor the economy could sustain such a military operation. </p> <p> "Even if you think Iraq is extreme, we are not crazy," said a senior Government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "With what were we expected to attack Kuwait? We don't have much air power and we are not going to send ground troops out there without air cover." </p> <p> Risking a Russian veto, the United States pressed today for a quick vote on a Security Council resolution requiring Iraq to pull back its troops from the Kuwait border. It warned that it might attack Iraq with or without the Council's support. </p> <p> The Security Council plans to meet on Saturday to continue consultations on Iraq. They were adjourned this evening after the Clinton Administration formally introduced its resolution. </p> <p> The United States will take military action against Iraq if it does not complete the withdrawal of Republican Guard forces from southern Iraq, Defense Secretary William J. Perry said today. </p> <p> He said intelligence reports confirmed that "a major part" of a division of Republican Guard troops was digging in near Nasiriya, a southern city along the Euphrates, instead of returning to their base farther north. An Iraqi division numbers roughly 10,000 troops. </p> <p> In an unusual public clash reminiscent of cold war debates, Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, came to the Security Council today to win sympathy for Saddam Hussein but was roundly rebuffed by the United States. </p> <p> Mr. Kozyrev, fresh from a visit to Iraq and Kuwait, criticized the Iraqi troop buildup near the Kuwaiti border for creating "a dangerous situation." But he also suggested that Iraq had no intention of invading Kuwait, citing reports in the Iraqi press that the troops were merely conducting maneuvers. </p> <p> Inevitably, there were handshakes and smiles all around today in New York as the Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, met his American counterpart, Warren M. Christopher. </p> <p> But after a week of not-so-private squabbling over Mr. Kozyrev's trip to Baghdad and his possible deal with the Iraqi President, Saddam Hussein, the Americans are being polite through clenched teeth. They are trying to insure that Russia's intervention, and its efforts to get the United Nations oil embargo on Iraq lifted after a six-month "trial period," do not get in the way of Washington's policy. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration said today that it would introduce a Security Council resolution next week calling for the automatic lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia's Muslim-led Government in six months. </p> <p> The move is an opening maneuver in what are likely to be delicate negotiations with Russia, Britain, France and Germany, who have been working with the United States in a so-called "contact group" on Bosnian peace. </p> <p> Iraq said today that it would recognize the independence and current borders of Kuwait, a major step apparently intended to allow at least some United Nations sanctions against Baghdad to be lifted. </p> <p> A declaration of the Revolutionary Command Council, signed by President Saddam Hussein, said Iraq accepted the "sovereignty of the State of Kuwait, its territorial integrity and political independence." The recognition, more than four years after Iraq invaded Kuwait and provoked the Persian Gulf war, was also approved by the Iraqi Parliament and is to be published in the Government's gazette, as required by United Nations resolutions. </p> <p> Several billion barrels of oil under the Caspian Sea lie waiting to be tapped off the stony coast of this former Soviet republic. No technical difficulties preclude a daily oil output that could eventually be equal to a tenth of what is produced each day in the United States. </p> <p> But a Western-led consortium that is spending $7 billion to develop the huge new oilfields has found itself frustrated by the political realities of a region of Central Asia where Russia, Iran, Turkey and the West have historically competed for influence. </p> <p> When Aleksandr Belyakov, governor of the Leningrad region of Russia, was invited to a recent meeting of the National Governors Association, he used the opportunity to share notes with his American counterparts about common problems. </p> <p> But what he was really looking forward to was a chance to rub shoulders with a man with whom he has even more in common -- the chicken king Frank Perdue. </p> <p> The Boeing Company said yesterday that it was lobbying the Clinton Administration to block Federal loan guarantees that would apply to a Russian airline's purchase of Russian jetliners equipped with American-made engines. Boeing officials said the deal could set a precedent of assisting a foreign competitor. </p> <p> The dispute puts Boeing in contention with one of its key suppliers, the United Technologies Corporation, whose Pratt & Whitney division would supply the engines for the 300-seat Ilyushin IL-96 MT jetliner. Although the IL-96 has been flying for several years, the addition of the Pratt & Whitney engines as well as avionics from the Rockwell International Corporation's Collins unit makes it a much stronger competitor on the world airline market. </p> <p> New evidence of an Iraqi military buildup has helped the United States beat back an effort to lift United Nations sanctions against Baghdad, senior Administration officials said today. </p> <p> They said the Clinton Administration had shared intelligence data, including satellite photos, with other Security Council members to show that President Saddam Hussein has been rebuilding factories that could produce chemical weapons or missiles, and integrating stolen Kuwaiti missiles and armored vehicles into the Iraqi Army. </p> <p> Oscar fever does not usually run too high in Russia, but Aleksandr Boitsov is an enterprising man in a tough market. For the month or so before the Oscar ceremony last month, instead of just displaying the usual "Rocky" and Sharon Stone films, he pushed videocassettes of the year's major Academy Award nominees. </p> <p> For a little more than $2 apiece, shoppers at the mammoth outdoor software and video market here can choose among "Pulp Fiction" (loosely translated as "Criminal Reading Material"), "Forrest Gump," "Nell" and many other video titles that are not even available yet in the United States. </p> <p> On an Army parade ground rich with history, President Clinton paid solemn tribute today to the generation that won World War II and prevailed in the cold war, thanking veterans for their sacrifice but warning that the nation still faced "forces of darkness" abroad and at home. </p> <p> "Because of all you did, we live in a moment of hope, in a nation at peace," Mr. Clinton told veterans in a ceremony at Fort Myer, Va. </p> <p> Smirnoff, the popular American-made vodka, is going back to its Russian roots to challenge such high-end imported vodkas as Stolichnaya and Absolut. </p> <p> Smirnoff Black, the first Smirnoff vodka made in Russia since 1917, is gradually appearing in bars and liquor stores. It will be available this month in nine states -- New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, South Carolina and Texas -- and will be sold nationally by autumn. Overseas, it is available in Britain, Ireland, Spain, South Africa, Singapore and duty-free shops, and about a dozen more countries will begin selling Smirnoff Black in the fall. </p> <p> When President Clinton decided to make one detour from his Moscow summit-meeting agenda to publicize a successful American business investment in Russia, he chose Coke. </p> <p> The President plans to visit a $65 million Coca-Cola plant near here on Thursday morning. Pepsi, which has already been losing market share to Coca-Cola in the former Soviet Union, was not thrilled with the decision. </p> <p> President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin announced partial agreements today on aspects of European security and the spread of nuclear weapons, but they remained far apart on the expansion of NATO, Russian nuclear sales to Iran and the war in secessionist Chechnya. </p> <p> After trying for weeks to lower expectations, to the point where officials on both sides predicted no accords would develop, both Presidents emphasized today at the end of their summit meeting that they had achieved something concrete during their three hours of intense discussions. </p> <p> Seeking to explain a trade ban against Iran, Secretary of State Warren Christopher today portrayed the country as an "outlaw state" that spends hundreds of millions of dollars a year on international terrorism and offered what he called proof that Teheran has been trying for a decade to develop nuclear weapons. </p> <p> In briefing reporters, Mr. Christopher also called on America's allies to punish Iran with economic sanctions of their own and expressed hope that the American decision would move Russia and China to renege on their pledges to help Iran build nuclear energy plants. </p> <p> As President Clinton prepared for summit talks with President Boris N. Yeltsin, Republican leaders warned today of "catastrophic consequences" for United States aid to Russia if Moscow goes ahead with plans to sell nuclear technology to Iran. </p> <p> House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Russia's insistence on selling Iran light-water nuclear reactors and equipment useful in making bomb-grade material threatened to jeopardize relations between Moscow and Washington. </p> <p> Everyone has his own idea of heaven. For Nikolai Gereshenko, it's a place driven by a Pentium computer chip. </p> <p> "This is the fastest thing I have ever seen," said the wide-eyed, sallow-skinned salesman, as he sat mesmerized last week before a 21-inch monitor set up at Comtek, Russia's enormous annual computer show. "I really want one of these. They are expensive, but how can we live without them? I'd even trade my car for one." </p> <p> The Exxon Corporation is expected to sign an agreement in Moscow today that will take it a step closer to participating in a $15 billion project off Sakhalin Island to develop giant oil and natural gas fields that may contain 2.5 billion barrels of oil. </p> <p> In a ceremony in Moscow that Vice President Al Gore and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia are expected to attend, the final touches will be put on a production-sharing agreement that will eventually allow Exxon and its Japanese and Russian partners to begin work on the field. </p> <p> The offshore banking system on this Mediterranean island is being used to violate United Nations sanctions imposed on the rump Yugoslavia and to launder hundreds of millions of dollars made illicitly in Russia, say Western diplomats, bankers and even some of those involved in the business. </p> <p> About three dozen of the 500 Serbian companies set up in Cyprus are believed to have links to the Government in Yugoslavia, which now consists of Serbia and Montenegro. </p> <p> Western European governments and Russia consider the Senate vote a grave mistake, and they warned again that American arms shipments to the Bosnian Government would lead to the withdrawal of all United Nations forces. </p> <p> Having recently strengthened the United Nations force with about 10,000 additional troops and won United Nations assent to increased NATO air strikes if the Bosnian Serbs attack the enclave around Gorazde, Western European governments said the Senate vote could undermine the impression of greater allied resolve. </p> <p> Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, Russia's Prime Minister, is widely seen as a potential successor to President Boris N. Yeltsin. Since becoming Prime Minister in December 1992, Mr. Chernomyrdin, the former Soviet Minister for Natural Gas, has grown remarkably in office. </p> <p> He has developed a sophisticated new understanding of macroeconomics and of political survival, nurtured a close relationship with Vice President Al Gore and disclosed a new humanity to Russians when he negotiated an end to the hostage crisis in Budyonnovsk. </p> <p> Eager for a central mediating role in the widening Balkan war, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia called again today for an international peace conference to be held here under his direction. </p> <p> At the same time, though, he warned that further Croatian aggression against Serbs could force Russia to abandon unilaterally the international sanctions that have been imposed on what is left of Yugoslavia: Serbia and Montenegro. </p> <p> A Russian court has ruled that the American vodka Smirnoff, the world's biggest-selling vodka brand, cannot be sold under that name in Russia. </p> <p> The ruling follows a complaint brought in 1993 by the American distributor and producer of Smirnoff, Heublein Inc., which sought to stop the Russian descendants of Peter Smirnoff, who distilled vodka for the czar before the Russian Revolution in 1917, from selling vodka under the Smirnoff name in Russia. </p> <p> Long frustrated in its efforts to export more oil, the Government of Kazakhstan, along with its partner, the Chevron Corporation, is trying to form a broader alliance and win Russia's support to break a stalemate over pipelines. </p> <p> For the last year, Kazakhstan and Chevron have been working to bring together a new consortium to build a pipeline to connect the rich Tengiz fields to the export ports of the Black Sea controlled by Russia. They are trying to attract big oil companies like Mobil and AGIP of Italy that can help finance the project and that have the influence to overcome political hurdles. </p> <p> Long frustrated in its efforts to export more oil, the Government of Kazakhstan, along with its partner, the Chevron Corporation, is trying to form a broader alliance and win Russia's support to break a stalemate over pipelines. </p> <p> For the last year, Kazakhstan and Chevron have been working to bring together a new consortium to build a pipeline to connect the rich Tengiz fields to the export ports of the Black Sea controlled by Russia.

Yeltsin of Russia compounded concerns about European fuel supplies. </p> <p> Russia, one of the world's largest producers of crude, is a top supplier of fuels to Europe. A change in Russian leadership could cause supply disruptions at a time when heating oil stocks are low and winter is at hand. </p> <p> Stripped of its most controversial provision, a bill that would moderately tighten the United States embargo against Cuba was approved overwhelmingly today by the Senate. The vote was 74 to 24. </p> <p> The bill would insure that a country that buys Cuban sugar and molasses does  not resell either product to the United States. It also seeks to reduce aid to Russia by $200 million -- the same amount Russia reportedly pays Cuba to rent an electronic intelligence-gathering base. </p> <p> A sharp hint of winter has begun to fill the air here. Most days the frost is still gone with the sun, but now is the time when Russians begin to dress like Russians again: the season of fur has returned. </p> <p> And this year it has returned with a twist that has astonished everyone from  the people in this small town who run the country's largest fur farm to shopkeepers in Moscow and importers across the globe. </p> <p> A sharp hint of winter has begun to fill the air here.

Now it is also a high-energy drink loaded with sugar and caffeine. </p> <p> Semtex, the drink, is one of the most successful consumer products in the post-Communist Czech Republic. In less than a year it has become popular as well in Slovakia and Hungary, and will soon go on sale in Austria and Russia. </p> <p> When Victor Spivak joined forces in 1993 with two other immigrants from the former Soviet Union, their export trading company was little more than a cramped studio apartment in New York. </p> <p> But now the 27-year-old Mr. Spivak is riding the crest of a booming export business. His enterprise -- the Ascop Company -- has some 180 employees and customers from St. Petersburg to Novosibirsk. </p> <p> When Victor Spivak joined forces in 1993 with two other immigrants from the former Soviet Union, their export trading company was little more than a cramped studio apartment in New York. </p> <p> But now the 27-year-old Mr. Spivak is riding the crest of a booming export business. His enterprise -- the Ascop Company -- has some 180 employees and customers from St. Petersburg to Novosibirsk. </p> <p> In a major election-year boost for President Boris N. Yeltsin, the International Monetary Fund and Russia agreed today on a $10.2 billion loan to carry forward the country's free-market reforms. </p> <p> The loan, second only to the the bailout package for Mexico last year, is linked to a sweeping plan to proceed with privatization, trade liberalization and other critical steps to move Russia toward a capitalist economy. </p> <p> Yevgeny M. Primakov, the new Russian Foreign Minister, said today that Russia continued to desire a close working relationship with the United States and had  no intention of trying to resurrect the Soviet Union. </p> <p> Mr. Primakov, who spoke after two days of meetings here with Secretary of State Warren Christopher, also said Russia would not put into effect any new oil deal with Iraq until the United Nations lifted sanctions against it. </p> <p> Next week's negotiations that could lift cold war trade restrictions on Russian firearms have angered some gun-control advocates in Congress, who say the deal could allow importers to flood the American market with millions of inexpensive Russian handguns and rifles. </p> <p> It is not clear how many Russian guns might be imported under the trade deal, but officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms have said that as of early 1995 they had received 270 applications for licenses to import from Russia as many as 3 million rifles, 1.2 million handguns and 9 billion rounds of ammunition. </p> <p> A nasty little skirmish between Russia and the United States is brewing here  over a threatened trade barrier. </p> <p> But this fight is not about manufactured consumer goods or high technology, but about American chicken, which has flooded the Russian market. </p> <p> The White House is about to take one of the greatest national security gambles since the end of the cold war. To please the computer industry, the Clinton Administration is preparing to send powerful American supercomputers to  Russian nuclear weapons laboratories. </p> <p> The Convex Computer Corporation, a subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard, wants to send two computers to Arzamas-16, where Moscow's first atomic and hydrogen bombs were built, and another one to Chelyabinsk-70, the center that developed most of Russia's nuclear warheads, including the world's most powerful hydrogen bomb. The three machines, together worth almost $8 million, operate faster than anything now in Russia. </p> <p> The United States Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, said today that he had reached an agreement with Russia that will prevent imports of cheap Russian handguns. </p> <p> The agreement allows the importation of only certain Olympic-style target pistols, hunting and sporting rifles and certain "curios and relics" more than 50 years old, Mr. Kantor said in a statement. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration has begun an unusually high-level effort to settle the bitter war over Nagorno-Karabakh, a disputed enclave of ethnic Armenians in  Azerbaijan, and to help make the region safe for oil development, American officials said today. </p> <p> The deputy national security adviser, Sandy Berger, and the Deputy Secretary  of State, Strobe Talbott, have been dispatched to Azerbaijan and Armenia for talks this week. </p> <p> Russia has dropped a plan for a sharp across-the-board increase in import tariffs, clearing the way for a $10.2 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, Western economists said tonight. </p> <p> The election-year loan had been thrown into doubt earlier this month after Russia's Finance Minister, Vladimir G. Panskov, proposed a 20 percent increase in the tariffs, contradicting previous assurances to the I.M.F. </p> <p> Shares of Tyson Foods Inc. and other poultry producers rose yesterday after Russia promised not to bar imports of chickens from the United States. </p> <p> Stock of Tyson, of Springdale, Ark., the world's largest poultry processor, rose 50 cents, to $22.75, in heavy Nasdaq trading. Shares of Hudson Foods Inc. of Rogers, Ark., rose $1.125, to $15, on the New York Stock Exchange, and shares of the Pilgrim's Pride Corporation of Pittsburg, Tex., climbed 25 cents, to $7, on the Big Board. </p> <p> When President Clinton flew to Egypt two weeks ago, he met with some 30 world leaders to discuss Middle Eastern terrorism, and with the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, to talk about Bosnia, NATO, their re-election campaigns and bilateral annoyances -- including chicken parts. </p> <p> According to an official and classified American memorandum of the conversation, Mr. Yeltsin made a direct request to Mr. Clinton for support in his campaign, and Mr. Clinton promised to concentrate on creating a "positive impact" on American-Russian relations. Mr. Clinton asked Mr. Yeltsin for help in clearing up "negative" issues between the countries, including the chicken impasse. </p> <p> The Senate moved today to punish the Cuban Government for its downing of two  American private aircraft last month, passing legislation that would tighten the embargo on American trade with Cuba and punish other countries that insisted on  continuing trade on their own. </p> <p> The vote, on the final compromise version of legislation first approved by the House and Senate last fall, was 74 to 22. The compromise now goes to the House, which is expected to approve it later this week. </p> <p> A trade dispute between the United States and Russia was apparently settled today when Washington received formal assurances that American poultry shipments to Russia would continue without interruption. </p> <p> Vice President Al Gore announced this evening that he had been assured by Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia that a stoppage of poultry imports from the United States, threatened March 16, would not take place. </p> <p> Contradicting assurances made to the International Monetary Fund only a week  ago, Russia's Finance Minister has proposed a broad increase in import tariffs. </p> <p> The plan, which would raise tariffs by an average of 20 percent, appears intended to boost the political fortunes of President Boris N. Yeltsin by raising revenue for new social spending. It could also placate angry farmers and industrialists hurt by foreign competition. </p> <p> The White House sought today to rebut senior House Republicans about newspaper allegations that President Clinton tried to strike a deal with President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia to benefit Arkansas poultry producers. </p> <p> The House Republicans suggested in a letter to the White House that an agreement lifting Russian trade barriers on American poultry was tainted by domestic politics. They sought classified memorandums that they said might demonstrate a quid pro quo between the leaders, designed to help one another's re-election chances. </p> <p> Tyson Foods Inc. said it had received export licenses from Russian officials  that would allow it to resume shipments of its poultry. </p> <p> A Tyson spokesman, Ed Nicholson, said he was not sure whether the company had actually sent out its first new shipment. </p> <p> Moving to tap the vast oil resources near the Caspian Sea, Russia, Kazakstan  and Oman have agreed on a new accord to build a major oil pipeline. </p> <p> Seeking to overcome longstanding financial disputes, the accord sets terms for a pipeline to connect Kazakstan's rich Tengiz oilfield to a Russian port on the Black Sea. </p> <p> The Communist leader, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, released the outline of his economic program today, a plan to revive the economy by having Russia spend its  way out of industrial and agricultural decline and seal itself off from foreign  competition. </p> <p> In sharp contrast to the free-market reforms of President Boris N. Yeltsin, Mr. Zyuganov's proposal, which is centered on tight government control and regulation of the economy, is the most specific he has offered to date. It calls for heavy state spending on industry, particularly the military-industrial complex, as well as on education and medical care. The proposal advocates strict price controls on consumer goods and raw materials and lowering energy prices to stimulate domestic production. </p> <p> Surrounded by beaver coats, ermine jackets and fox trim hats, Perry Green happily remembered the recent morning here when 13 Russian women walked into his store empty-handed -- and walked out with 15 mink coats. </p> <p> But conversation in his chilly fur vault heated up when the rotund Alaskan furrier looked at the coming presidential elections on the far side of the Bering Strait. Noting that only a year ago he opened another store, at Anchorage's airport, to cater to Russian tourists who come for the variety, quality and low prices they do not find at home, he said: "I don't think the Communists will win. Even if they do, once you have tasted freedom, you can't shut it off." </p> <p> In a stinging rebuff to President Boris N. Yeltsin, the Communist-dominated Parliament has rejected legislation intended to encourage billions of dollars of foreign investment in the oil and gas industry. </p> <p> With breathtaking speed, Russia's Far East has switched in five years from propping up North Korea's Communist Government to welcoming South Korean investment and trade. </p> <p> In the wake of diplomatic ties between Russia and South Korea being established in 1991, trade between the two countries has tripled, reaching about $3 billion last year. In contrast, trade between Russia and North Korea has collapsed, falling to $140 million last year, from $2.6 billion in 1990. </p> <p> Russia, eager to bolster its economy with the hard currency it earns from the sale of everything from bullets to jet fighters, surpassed the United States and France last year as the largest arms seller to the developing world, according to a new Congressional report. </p> <p> The report by the Congressional Research Service calculated that Russian arms sales to developing nations rebounded from a slump that set in after the breakup of the Soviet Union, growing by 62 percent last year -- to $6 billion in 1995 from $3.7 billion in 1994 -- and that its most important buyer was China. </p> <p> WITH its huge fields in decline in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, ARCO has been looking for new prospects overseas. Among the primary prospects for ARCO and other Western oil companies are Russia and some of the former Soviet republics like Kazakstan and Azerbaijan. </p> <p> ARCO's approach has been different. Rather than form a consortium of Western companies to battle the Byzantine bureaucracies of the region, ARCO has teamed up with Lukoil, Russia's largest oil company. </p> <p> Galina Glazova walked purposefully down a narrow, crowded street in black ankle boots, a white leather jacket and matching skirt, trailed by her friend Tatyana Savkina and the beckoning glances of several hundred Turkish merchants. She regally ignored the warm cries of ''Natasha! Natasha!'' (the generic Turkish word for Russian woman) and entered a narrow basement shop. </p> <p> ''My ladies, come in, come in,'' Ismail Tosun, the Turkish owner, cooed in Russian. The women embraced him and his Bulgarian assistant like old friends and settled in. Forty-eight hours and about $4,000 apiece later, Mrs. Glazova, 43, and Mrs. Savkina, 44, had each bought more than half a ton of scarves, pajamas, nighties and housecoats, and were ready to go home and resell them in a wholesale market in Moscow. </p> <p> IF free market economists wrote their own fair trade law from scratch, the little known Antidumping Act of 1916 would not be a bad model. The law, which is still on the books, provides antitrust protection against predatory pricing by foreigners, sanctioning importers who sell at low prices in America with the intent of putting American competitors out of business. </p> <p> But free market types are hardly applauding a lawsuit brought by Geneva Steel of Utah contending that two importers of steel from Russia, China and Ukraine are violating the 1916 law. The still-murky tale, as first told in The Rushford Report, a newsletter on international trade published in Washington, makes all too clear that in the highly politicized world of trade, the game is to use the law to circumvent market forces -- not reinforce them. ''The 1916 act could prove to be a great way to beat competitors into submission,'' cautions Ron Cass, a former member of the United States International Trade Commission who is now dean of Boston University's School of Law. </p> <p> Saying he had come to close the circle, Natan Sharansky returned as an Israeli Cabinet Minister today to the country from which he was expelled 11 years ago as a convicted traitor. </p> <p> Landing in Moscow in the freezing darkness of early morning, the 49-year-old Mr. Sharansky, a former dissident, denied feelings of nostalgia or triumph. </p> <p> There would be enough on the foreign policy plate even if this President were preoccupied with foreign policy. If President Clinton's first term was about minimalist goals -- intervening when absolutely necessary to stop the killing in Haiti and Bosnia, finding a workable China policy, helping to keep Russia from falling apart -- his second term is inevitably more ambitious. </p> <p> Mr. Clinton would like to preside over an expanded NATO, a Syrian-Israeli settlement in the Middle East, peace in Northern Ireland, and a relationship with both Russia and China that anchors them in the obligations of the community of nations. </p> <p> Russia's border crossings are often more like bazaars than checkpoints. All kinds of things are for sale: South Korean TV sets, American chocolate, Italian spumante, local women. </p> <p> As foreign goods enter the country and begin their circuitous route to the Russian consumer, they inevitably pass through the hands of the greedy customs inspector. The enormous bribes importers pay these officials are bargains compared with official duties of as much as 120 percent. Failure to pay either the bribe or the tax can mean confiscation. </p> <p> The Zotov family is reduced by new, post-Communist poverty to taking in washing to make ends meet. The brainless eldest son, Albert, invites a high-priced interior decorator to design a high-concept laundry for them. </p> <p> In minces a New Russian fop in white tie and tails, spewing English and French words and grandiose decorating schemes. He instantly clashes with the aging grandfather, an old Communist and veteran of many Soviet wars, who mistakes the title of designer for a Jewish surname. </p> <p> The chairman of Silicon Graphics Inc. said today that his company ''made some serious judgmental errors'' when it shipped two small supercomputer systems last month to a Russian laboratory that designs nuclear weapons and performs computer simulations of nuclear explosions. </p> <p> ''It is possible we were duped,''  Edward R. McCracken, the chairman and chief executive of the company, said in a telephone interview. </p> <p> In a setback for the United States, the Security Council issued a statement today that did not condemn Iraq for violating sanctions by flying a group of Muslims to Saudi Arabia last week without United Nations permission so they could make the pilgrimage to Mecca. </p> <p> After four days of tortuous diplomacy, the Council issued a unanimous statement that failed to say whether the flight violated sanctions  imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 or deliver even the mildest rebuke to Iraq after China and Egypt, with varying degrees of support from Russia and France, took a firm stand against criticizing Baghdad. </p> <p> An American-led campaign to persuade the Security Council to condemn Saddam Hussein for sending a planeload of Iraqi pilgrims to Saudi Arabia, in what the United States says is a violation of United Nations sanctions, appears to be in trouble. </p> <p> In two days of discussion, France, China, Russia and Guinea-Bissau all questioned whether the flight was a serious violation of sanctions slapped on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The Security Council adjourned on Friday night, agreeing to reconvene on Monday. </p> <p> A Federal judge in Oakland, Calif., has temporarily banned the Government from issuing new import permits for raw logs and wood chips because they can harbor insect pests and plant diseases that could endanger American forests. </p> <p> The order, issued on June 5 by  Judge Claudia Wilken of Federal District Court, will bar shipments from Siberia, New Zealand and central Mexico. She issued a nationwide injunction preventing the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, a branch of the Agriculture Department, from issuing any new import permits for raw wood products, except tropical hardwoods and products from bordering regions of Canada and Mexico, which are not thought to pose a threat. </p> <p> AEROFLOT has long held a worldwide reputation for rude service, disgusting food and scary landings. Comedians have made Aeroflot jokes for decades. Now the Russian airline is making fun of itself. </p> <p> In its first big multimedia advertising campaign, Aeroflot has chosen a new image for itself: a flying elephant. </p> <p> After heavy lobbying by the computer industry and the Clinton Administration, the Senate today rejected a proposal to tighten control of the sale of American supercomputers to China and Russia and instead voted for further study of the issue. </p> <p> The question of whether to tighten supercomputer export controls will now be resolved in a conference with the House of Representatives, which last month overwhelmingly passed a measure requiring a license for sales of some computers to countries such as China and Russia. The different Senate and House measures are attached to the Defense Authorization Act. </p> <p> Addressing concerns over the sale of American supercomputers to Russia and China, the Clinton Administration added 13 foreign organizations today to its list of groups that are involved in secretly producing nuclear weapons and will now require special Federal approval to buy American technology. </p> <p> Six organizations in Russia and China will now be on ''an alert to exporters'' and additional names will be added soon, said William A. Reinsch, Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration. </p> <p> China is the world's biggest source for technology used by third-world nations building ballistic missiles, chemical weapons or nuclear bombs, according to a new report by the Central Intelligence Agency. </p> <p> The unclassified, biannual report submitted to Congress and made public this week briefly summarizes the C.I.A.'s efforts to keep track of the spread of weapons of mass destruction -- nuclear, chemical and biological weapons as well as powerful missiles to deliver them. </p> <p> Big rockets can launch warheads as easily as astronauts and throughout the space age have been used interchangeably for such wildly dissimilar jobs. This fact of technological life is one of the main reasons that Washington puts up with the tragicomedy of the Russian Mir space station. </p> <p> As Mir has lurched from glitch to near-disaster, Americans who watched NASA astronauts join their Russian counterparts on the station wondered why the space agency would put them in a situation so seemingly unsafe. </p> <p> China has agreed to return to the United States a powerful supercomputer that was illegally transferred to a military institute earlier this year, Clinton Administration officials said today. They are trumpeting the case as a rare victory in controlling equipment that can aid in designing nuclear weapons. </p> <p> The officials said the computer, a powerful workstation produced by Sun Microsystems, was still at the Changsha Institute of Science and Technology, which is run by the Chinese military. But after Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Commerce Department officials complained to their Chinese counterparts, China's trade ministry agreed to return the machine to the United States. </p> <p> Eldar Porolashvili has been stranded here on the border between Georgia and Russia since mid-July, sleeping in a truck with 10 tons of raw alcohol for making vodka. </p> <p> Russia will not let him cross the border. The Georgian port where he picked up his load will not let him take it back. And Mr. Porolashvili, who will not be paid until he delivers his goods, does not have enough money or gas for a return trip even if he wanted to try his luck. </p> <p> Despite the personal intervention of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, the United States is meeting sustained resistance in the Security Council to its plan for imposing new sanctions on Iraq, diplomats on the Council said today. </p> <p> With a vote on the issue likely to take place in the next few days, the United States is trying to negotiate a compromise that would leave the threat intact but postpone the date the additional sanctions would be applied. </p> <p> Defying the United States, a Russian nuclear weapons laboratory secretly acquired 16 advanced I.B.M. computers late last year, using Moscow-based middlemen to evade American export rules, Russian and American officials say. </p> <p> A Federal grand jury in Washington is examining I.B.M.'s role, American officials and executives say, to determine whether the company or its representatives violated laws governing the sale of computers to nuclear weapons installations. </p> <p> Congress is moving to tighten controls over the export of high performance American computers to Russia and China, prompting strong opposition from the White House and computer manufacturers and talk of a possible veto. </p> <p> Last week, House and Senate negotiators on the military authorization bill agreed on language that would require computer manufacturers to check with the Government before selling certain powerful computers to countries like China and Russia. It also requires more Federal monitoring of exports of high performance computers. </p> <p> The United States lost its battle to impose new sanctions on Iraq today and settled for a Security Council resolution that would keep only a strong threat of added restrictions. </p> <p> Opposed by France, Russia, China, Egypt and Kenya, the United States and Britain had to draw back both from a plan to impose an immediate international travel ban on senior Iraqi military and intelligence officials and from an alternative proposal to put the ban into effect automatically in six months if Iraq continued to obstruct efforts to destroy its major weapons systems. </p> <p> Mark the date: Saddam Hussein returned to Mideast political glory on Oct. 23, 1997, in a chamber of the United Nations Security Council. </p> <p> He did it by forcing America into one of its most humiliating retreats at the U.N. Saddam's victory was particularly tasty because it was given to him by four countries that America has befriended with blood, treasure, trade or all three. He has shown the Mideast that countries the U.S. had counted on would put his interests above America's, given the right price. </p> <p> In the next few weeks the Clinton Administration will face the first test of its willingness to make good on a threat to punish foreign companies that invest in Iran. </p> <p> But the State Department is not exactly leaping at the chance to teach a lesson to Russia's premier  private company, Gazprom, for a $2 billion deal with French and Malaysian companies to pump natural gas off the Iranian coast. </p> <p> President Clinton and the people he chose to help him steer American foreign policy have steered it straight into a collision that left it a near-wreck. </p> <p> The collision was not as much between the U.S. and Iraq as between Mr. Clinton's policies and America's own best interests. </p> <p> Russia stepped up pressure today to hasten the process of declaring Iraq free of banned weapons, prompting the United States to stiffen its resistance and raising questions about how far Moscow will go -- alone if necessary -- in what is now seen here as a determined campaign to help Baghdad escape from sanctions. </p> <p> In the last few days, backstage diplomacy has turned to more open confrontation between Moscow and Washington, culminating tonight in a Russian attempt to block any Security Council action on the subject of Iraqi compliance unless Baghdad's progress in meeting disarmament requirements was emphasized. </p> <p> Saddam Hussein has won a 3-in-1 victory, the biggest since he was allowed to live and rule after his defeat in the gulf war six years ago. </p> <p> Every part of his triumph violates the conditions for peace that were imposed by the wartime coalition against him, and by the U.N. </p> <p> Russia followed up on its promise to help Iraq by asking today that the country be declared free of nuclear weapons and nearly free of prohibited missiles, diplomats said. </p> <p> Such declarations would bring Iraq a step closer to meeting the conditions for lifting the crushing economic sanctions imposed at the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991. </p> <p> The most frightening thing about the latest flare-up over Iraq is not how Saddam Hussein is behaving, but how our allies are behaving. Saddam is evil. But France, Russia and the U.N. -- they're scary. </p> <p> Saddam Hussein has absolutely no redeeming features. He has gone to war against five different countries: Israel, Kuwait, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. He tried to assassinate former President George Bush. He has murdered his closest relatives. He has used poison gas against Iran and the Kurds, and Scud missiles against Israeli cities. He is believed to be holding more than 600 Kuwaiti prisoners of war and refuses even to give the Red Cross their names. He invaded Kuwait to grab its oil wells and when forced to back down set Kuwait's oil fields ablaze, creating a monumental ecological disaster. He has never stood for election, he allows no freedom, he rules by terror. He has built a series of new palaces for himself since the gulf war, while Iraqi children suffer from malnutrition. He has done everything possible to evade U.N. inspections, in hopes of rebuilding his arsenal of nerve gas and germ weapons and to acquire a nuclear bomb. </p> <p> With Iraq's agreement to let all United Nations weapons inspectors return, the immediate crisis appears to have ended without use of military force, and the United States is declaring a victory for a united Security Council and for diplomacy. </p> <p> American officials argue that Saddam Hussein had to back down and that they preserved the authority of the United Nations. They also insist that the United States gave Iraq nothing concrete in return -- at least for now. </p> <p> The Security Council, in a unanimous vote, made good today on its intention to impose new sanctions on Iraq, including banning foreign travel by Iraqi officials who do not cooperate with a United Nations disarmament commission. But Iraqi officials immediately said they would defy the demands, raising new questions about what will happen next. </p> <p> The Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister, Tariq Aziz, said in a statement in New York that the resolution was ''unjust'' and would be ignored. </p> <p> Russia and Iraq have drafted a proposal to end the standoff between the United States and Saddam Hussein, Russia's Foreign Minister said this evening. </p> <p> Yevgeny M. Primakov, the Foreign Minister, said the plan would allow the United Nations to carry out weapons inspections, presumably with Americans taking part. But he said the inspectors' open-ended search for chemical, nuclear and biological weapons should be brought to a speedy conclusion. </p> <p> Iraq has told Russia that it will allow the unconditional return of all United Nations weapons inspectors, including Americans, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said this morning after an extraordinary 2 A.M. meeting here of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. </p> <p> Iraqi officials told the Russian Foreign Minister, Yevgeny M. Primakov, that Baghdad will make an announcement of its reversal later today, she said. </p> <p> Facing extraordinary pressure from Washington, a major Russian partner in a project to explore for natural gas in Iran today postponed a bond offering to raise up to $3 billion. </p> <p> The postponement has temporarily headed off a decision by the Clinton Administration about whether to impose sanctions on the companies involved. </p> <p> Defying American pressure to end its business dealings with Iran, Russia's huge natural gas company, Gazprom, has canceled an agreement with the United States Export-Import Bank. </p> <p> The American agency had agreed to guarantee $750 million in financing so Gazprom could purchase American equipment and services. The loan guarantees have come under fire in Congress because of Gazprom's decision to explore for gas in Iran. The Clinton Administration has also been considering sanctions against Russia. </p> <p> They held a party today at Saddam International Airport. Iraqi Airline employees danced to the tune of a drum-and-bugle band. Children ritually chanted anti-American slogans in English. Ten sheep were assembled on the runway to await their celebratory slaughter. </p> <p> The occasion? </p> <p> The economic crisis in Asia is beginning to have an unforeseen consequence: slowing a military spending spree that has thrown American, European and Russian arms makers into a heated competition for billions of dollars in weapons sales. </p> <p> In recent years, Asia, particularly Southeast Asia, had become the big growth market for fighters, missiles, tanks and other modern armaments, much to the dismay of arms-control advocates in the United States and other countries. </p> <p> Seven years ago, the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, begrudgingly blessed the American-led campaign to evict Iraqi forces from Kuwait. </p> <p> But now President Boris N. Yeltsin and his top aides have led the opposition to American military action against Iraq. </p> <p> The United States failed to obtain backing today for new sanctions to punish Yugoslavia for its violent crackdown in Kosovo Province, but Washington did receive a promise from Moscow that Russia would support a United Nations resolution for a comprehensive arms embargo on the Government of President Slobodan Milosevic. </p> <p> Before the meeting here of the so-called Contact Group, which monitors events in Yugoslavia and the nations that broke away from it,  American officials had suggested  that they wanted the group's six members -- the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Italy and Germany -- to immediately impose new sanctions on the Yugoslav Government. But further sanctions were postponed for now, according to a statement released after the meeting. </p> <p> NO ONE can argue with a straight face that the American economy is damaged or even threatened by what happened to oil this week. Sure, the producing countries announced that they intended to cut production. And in response, oil prices jumped for a day. They might even go a bit higher. But oil is still remarkably cheap, clearly a break for the national economy. </p> <p> Much is made of America's current economic success. While Europe and Japan wallow, the United States economy surges ahead. To many economists, politicians and executives, that demonstrates the superiority of the American model. Ever more efficient companies, these boosters say, have generated strong profits and full employment, without having to raise prices. And in such noninflationary conditions, robust economic growth can go on indefinitely. </p> <p> PALLADIUM FALLS. Palladium dropped 4.4 percent on optimism that Russia, the metal's top producer, would soon resume exports after an extended delay. June-delivery contracts settled at $258.70 an ounce, down $12. </p> <p> The United States and its Western allies decided today to impose modest diplomatic and economic sanctions on Yugoslavia for President Slobodan Milosevic's ''unacceptable use of force'' against the ethnic Albanian majority in the province of Kosovo. </p> <p> Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who had been seeking immediate and firm action against Mr. Milosevic, said today's decision was ''satisfactory.'' It was made in a four-hour emergency meeting of the so-called contact group that monitors Yugoslavia and the four neighboring republics that seceded from it. </p> <p> Secretary General Kofi Annan forged another direct link with Iraq today by unveiling procedures for Iraqi presidential sites to be inspected under the watchful eyes of diplomats. He also sent a new commissioner to Baghdad tonight to oversee the operation. </p> <p> The inspections, which could begin in two weeks, are the latest in a series of steps taken by Mr. Annan,  deferring to Iraqi concerns about weapons inspections and allowing  Baghdad to bypass the Security Council. Within the last two weeks, Iraqis have effectively moved from near-pariah status to regular and direct contact with the highest ranking United Nations officials. </p> <p> Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav President, may have made just enough concessions over the conflict in Kosovo Province to confound Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright's efforts to intensify Western sanctions against him, American and European officials said today. </p> <p> Ms. Albright heads off to Europe on Monday evening to try to increase the pressure on Mr. Milosevic to open a serious discussion about political autonomy with the ethnic Albanians who make up 90 percent of the population of the province, which is in southern Serbia. </p> <p> PALLADIUM AT 18-YEAR HIGH.  Palladium rose 3.7 percent on increased anxiety over export delays from Russia, the leading producer. June contracts rose $10.45, to $296.55 an ounce, the highest since March 1980. </p> <p> A standoff between the United States and Russia has apparently derailed plans for a Security Council debate early next week about changing the level of nuclear inspections in Iraq,  diplomats said today. </p> <p> The Security Council meets on Monday to review sanctions on Iraq, imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, following renewed Iraqi demands that the embargo be ended and weapons inspections restricted. The sanctions are expected to be renewed for another six months. </p> <p> PALLADIUM GAIN ERASED.  Palladium fell 2.8 percent, eradicating most of the advance from a day earlier, on indications that Russia may resume exports sooner than expected. June contracts fell $7.95 an ounce, to $279.10. </p> <p> Seeking to bring an end to the violence in Kosovo, the United States and five of its allies imposed new economic sanctions on Yugoslavia today. They threatened further action if the Yugoslavs do not agree to hold negotiations with the province's ethnic Albanian separatists. </p> <p> Calling the current situation in Kosovo ''untenable,'' the so-called contact group, which monitors events in Yugoslavia and the republics that broke away from it, also offered to reward Yugoslavia with membership in international economic organizations if it took steps toward a peaceful settlement with the leadership of the province. </p> <p> The price of palladium, a precious metal used in catalytic converters, computers and cellular phones, shot up to an 18-year-high yesterday, making it more expensive than gold. </p> <p> The main cause of the rally, which sent the spot price in London up $36.50 yesterday, to $332.50 an ounce, is the political turmoil in Russia, which has halted delivery of palladium from there all year. Russia is the world's biggest producer of palladium, and a similar disruption last year sent prices soaring then. </p> <p> The Senate voted nearly unanimously today to punish foreign enterprises or institutions -- especially those in Russia -- that provide sensitive missile technology or expertise to Iran. </p> <p> The overwhelming vote, 90 to 4, reflects the Senate's growing alarm at Iran's drive to build long-range rockets that could threaten American troops and allies in the Mideast, and frustration with Moscow for failing to curb missile know-how to Iran. </p> <p> In reactions that followed the relatively mild pattern of responses to nuclear tests conducted by India two weeks ago, Japan, Germany, Canada and Australia joined the United States today in taking action against Pakistan for going ahead with tests of its own. </p> <p> Other Pakistani trading partners, like France and Russia, expressed ''disappointment'' and ''concern'' at word of the tests but stopped short of recommending any sanctions. </p> <p> President Clinton urged President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia today to press for the ratification of a pending nuclear weapons treaty even as the United States and its allies searched for ways to head off a nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan. </p> <p> On his final day of meetings here with the leaders of the six other major industrial democracies and Russia, Mr. Clinton drew a link between American efforts to continue reducing the stores of nuclear weapons held by the former cold war antagonists and attempts to halt the spread of nuclear ability to other nations. </p> <p> PALLADIUM FALLS 10 PERCENT. Prices of palladium plunged on speculation that Russia, the top supplier, would soon end a long suspension of exports to help ease its debt crisis. June contracts fell $36.55 an ounce, to $313.50. </p> <p> The main Western industrial nations imposed an investment ban on Serbia today and froze its assets abroad as their concern grew about the violence in Kosovo, a southern Serbian province. They also froze the overseas assets of Yugoslavia, which is made up of Serbia and Montenegro. </p> <p> Foreign and Finance Ministers of the Group of Eight countries, meeting here as part of the summit meeting in Birmingham next week, called for urgent discussions between Belgrade and the Albanian leadership in  Kosovo, where Albanians make up 90 percent of the population. </p> <p> Russia today resisted the call to take tough action against India because of the underground nuclear tests. </p> <p> The Government condemned India's decision to conduct the tests. But it also opposed the use of economic sanctions and said President Boris N. Yeltsin would go ahead with a planned visit to India this year. </p> <p> Political turmoil in Indonesia, the collapse of many economies in Asia and the threatened economic sanctions on India all sent a key commodity index to its lowest level in more than four years yesterday. </p> <p> At the same time, the recent slump in the Russian stock market and the continued disruption of supplies from Russia sent the spot price of palladium over $400 an ounce -- and above the price of its sister metal, platinum, for the first time. Although the rally fizzled later in the day, palladium remains near an all-time high and could move higher. </p> <p> Trying to resolve two of the toughest disputes between the United States and Europe, the Clinton Administration  waived sanctions today against three foreign companies that are doing business in Iran and said that it would seek legislation to head off sanctions against businesses that operate in Cuba. </p> <p> In exchange the European Union and Russia agreed to tighten control of the export of weapons technology to Iran. The European Union also agreed with the United States to set up a system to govern confiscated property in Cuba and elsewhere. </p> <p> Russia today reaffirmed its refusal to join other countries in punishing India for resuming nuclear tests, and has so far failed to register an especially strong diplomatic protest. </p> <p> President Boris N. Yeltsin still plans to visit India later this year. And some top officials at Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy want to go ahead with plans to sell India two nuclear power plants. </p> <p> MARK GAINS.  The mark rose on speculation that the I.M.F., which has lent Russia $670 million to pay urgent debts, would grant further aid to Germany's biggest trading partner. The dollar fell to 1.8056 marks from 1.8087. </p> <p> MARK GAINS.  The German currency strengthened as Russia, a major trading partner of Germany, averted a default on debts by raising more than $2 billion in bond sales. In New York, the dollar fell to 1.7710 marks from 1.7806. </p> <p> Russia has agreed to sell two nuclear power stations to India, defying calls to punish New Delhi because of its testing of nuclear weapons. </p> <p> The head of the Atomic Energy Ministry here concluded the deal, worth $3 billion or more to Russia's cash-starved nuclear energy industry, on Sunday. </p> <p> Long-term interest rates fell sharply yesterday, as the Asian financial crisis and continuing problems in Russia apparently sent more foreigners to the haven of the American bond market. </p> <p> Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, helped the rally when he indicated, in an upbeat assessment of the economy, that an interest rate increase to slow economic growth was not imminent. </p> <p> SUGAR FALLS 5.4 PERCENT.  Sugar tumbled on speculation that a planned increase in import taxes by Russia would curtail demand from the leading importer of sugar. October contracts fell 0.49 cent, to 8.51 cents a pound. </p> <p> MARK RISES FURTHER. The mark strengthened to its highest level since late June on news that the I.M.F. would increase aid to Russia, Germany's main trading partner. The dollar fell to 1.8017 marks in New York from 1.8180. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration said today that it would impose trade sanctions on nine Russian companies and institutions that have been helping Iran with its missile program. </p> <p> The Administration's action comes as the Russian Government, for the first time, publicly announced an investigation into the nine enterprises for violating new export control laws worked out in cooperation with the United States. </p> <p> HIGHER MARK.  The mark rose after lawmakers in Russia, which relies heavily on German trade and investment, approved some parts of a plan to qualify for international aid. In New York the dollar fell to 1.7937 marks from 1.8043. </p> <p> Russia tried and failed to get Security Council action today on a resolution declaring that Iraq had complied with demands to destroy its nuclear weapons program and was ready to move away from intrusive inspections to long-term monitoring, </p> <p> The United States and Britain objected to two versions of a Russian proposal, diplomats said after the Council meeting heard a report from the International Atomic Energy Agency's Iraq expert, Garry Dillon of Britain. </p> <p> In February 1989, the last Soviet troops wearily crossed the bridge over the Amu Darya out of Afghanistan, a defeated army walking home to an empire on the verge of disintegration. </p> <p> Now, nearly a decade later, the Russians are back, secretly engaged in the new Afghan war, according to United States and foreign officials. </p> <p> An I.B.M. subsidiary pleaded guilty today to illegally exporting 17 advanced computers to a Russian nuclear weapons laboratory and agreed to pay an $8.5 million fine in what Federal investigators believed was the first criminal conviction against I.B.M. </p> <p> Russia secretly bought the computers in late 1996 and early 1997 in the mistaken belief that Washington would approve the sale after Moscow signed a total ban on nuclear tests. The ban, long advocated by the United States, was agreed to by Russia in September 1996. </p> <p> MARK WEAKENS.  The dollar rose against Germany's currency after the Russian central bank suspended dollar trading for the day. Germany is Russia's leading trade partner. The dollar rose to 1.8061 marks from 1.7994. </p> <p> Stock markets in Latin America plunged yesterday, raising more doubts about whether the region will be able to survive the economic crisis that has swamped Asia and is now pulling Russia to its knees. Currency declines in Mexico and the fear of a devaluation in Brazil are also adding pressure. </p> <p> The answer is not only important to the Governments and citizens of Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina, who have fought back with economic reforms since the drubbing they took in the wake of the Mexican peso devaluation in 1994-95. </p> <p> In the 1980's, the apartheid Government was obsessed with fear that it would be overrun by Communist-backed black guerrillas, and it presented the Soviet Union as a vast menace that justified brutal oppression. </p> <p> ''The truth is, it never was much of a threat,'' said Sampie Terreblanche, professor of political economy at Stellenbosch University here. ''Now, in the new South Africa, the collapse of the new Russia seems to be quite threatening.'' </p> <p> FOUR years ago, Finland established a free-trade zone along its border to encourage business with Russia, hoping to revive a relationship that had all but collapsed along with the dissolution of the Soviet order. </p> <p> Acer, the computer company based in Taiwan, decided to test the waters with a modest assembly operation at Lappeenranta, a small outpost on the Finnish side of the border, about 620 miles from Moscow. </p> <p> SUGAR FALLS 4.9 PERCENT.  Prices for raw sugar plunged on rising exports from Brazil and weakening demand in Russia, the leading sugar importer. The October-delivery contract dropped 0.36 cent, to 6.95 cents a pound. </p> <p> Normally the Yabao Road market here is a bustling place, with more than 2,000 bountiful stalls crammed full of gaudy fur coats, bejeweled fuzzy sweaters, lavish blond wigs and formidable lacy bras -- reflecting the latest fashion trends not of Beijing, but of Moscow. </p> <p> Here, throngs of independent Russian traders buy inexpensive Chinese goods in bulk for sale back home, providing a brisk business for the market's Chinese stall-owners, many former Government employees who have gone into business for themselves. </p> <p> CRUDE OIL SOARS.  Petroleum prices rose to the highest levels in seven weeks as Nigerian and Russian shipments were delayed, which could reduce world inventories. Crude oil for October delivery rose $1, to $14.67 a barrel. </p> <p> The chief United Nations weapons inspector for Iraq said today that the Government of Saddam Hussein had gone beyond its decision to block surprise inspections and is now interfering with routine monitoring operations. </p> <p> The inspector, Richard Butler, told the Security Council about the deteriorating situation in Iraq as the United States and Britain moved to keep comprehensive sanctions on the Iraqis until they resume cooperation. </p> <p> When the Clinton Administration relaxed export controls on high-performance computers in 1996, it relied on a flawed report that did not study the national security implications and concluded with scant data that the computers were already easily available around the world, Government auditors said today. </p> <p> Just the opposite conclusion is true, said the General Accounting Office, the audit arm of Congress. In a report released to a Senate panel, the auditors found that such high-performance computers ''are not readily available'' to countries of national security concern to the United States, like China, India or Pakistan. </p> <p> Scott R. Mackie doesn't envy his old boss. </p> <p> Before he took over recently as head of General Motors Poland, Mr. Mackie worked at G.M.'s big German unit, Opel, under David J. Herman. In June,  G.M. dispatched Mr. Herman to Moscow, where he is now puzzling out a strategy in the wake of Russia's troubled collision with capitalism. </p> <p> HOGS RISE 1.9 PERCENT.  Prices strengthened from four-year lows after the United States said it would donate pork to Russia. The December contract for lean hog carcasses rose 0.65 cent to settle at 35.85 cents a pound. </p> <p> PALLADIUM UP SHARPLY.  Palladium prices rose on continued concerns that Russia will reduce exports next year even as demand grows. In New York, palladium for December delivery rose $11.65, to $292.50 an ounce. </p> <p> Russia, Kazakhstan and major oil companies today agreed to build a multibillion-dollar pipeline to link the oil-rich Caspian Sea region with the Black Sea. </p> <p> The project is scheduled to be completed in 2001 and would be the first major new pipeline in the region. It would connect the Tengiz oilfield to a Russian port. </p> <p> Is what's good for the banana good for the steel? Not to the Clinton Administration. In a space of 24 hours, it threatened to slap 100 percent tariffs on European wines, cheeses and other products unless the European Union scrapped its restrictions on low-cost bananas shipped there by American companies, and then turned around and warned that it would not tolerate the ''flooding of our market'' with low-cost steel and other goods from Asia and Russia. </p> <p> President Clinton came face-to-face today with the political costs of the world economic crisis, meeting with steel executives and union leaders who are demanding that Washington cut off the import of extremely low-cost steel -- much of it from Brazil, Russia and South Korea. </p> <p> Steel imports into the United States have surged by more than 75 percent in recent months, and the United Steelworkers of America, a union the White House cannot afford to antagonize after it helped mobilize Democratic votes on Tuesday, has been insisting for months that the Administration take action. </p> <p> Soon after dawn each day, the promenade that runs along the shore of the Caspian Sea here fills with Americans and other expatriates out for a morning run. </p> <p> Many of them are Texas oilmen, and after dark they congregate at Margaritaville, a Tex-Mex restaurant that serves tacos, enchiladas and refried beans. Gas executives from Louisiana prefer the jambalaya and gumbo at another favorite haunt, the Ragin' Cajun. Later, some join the newly rich Azerbaijanis who pack glittery local discos. </p> <p> A new cold war has broken out between Russia and the United States, this time over hot-rolled steel. </p> <p> More than just steel is at stake in the trade dispute, which is sure to drag in both Governments before it is over. The case turns on jobs and profits, but also on politics as it tests the American Government's support for Russia's painful economic transition. </p> <p> Vadim Voloboyev's day begins before sunrise, when he scurries over to a weather-beaten barn to supervise the morning milking. </p> <p> It is not the easiest job. Two hundred cows are crammed together in a stockade originally built for pigs. The farm cannot afford new conveyor belts to dispense the cheap feed or remove the pungent manure. </p> <p> President Clinton said for the first time today that the United States would not tolerate the ''flooding of our markets'' with low-cost goods from Asia and Russia, particularly steel, that are threatening the jobs of American workers. </p> <p> The President's statement came days after a White House meeting of top executives of steel companies and the United Steelworkers of America, which helped get out the vote for Democrats last week, playing a pivotal role with other unions in the party's success in midterm elections. </p> <p> In an effort to prevent nuclear weapons and materials from being smuggled out of Russia, the United States announced plans yesterday to train Russian customs agents in identifying and arresting smugglers. </p> <p> ''The cold war is over, but the weapons are still around,'' said Rick Galbraith, a policy coordinator at the United States Customs Service in Washington. ''The Russians were really good at keeping track of their nuclear weapons.'' </p> <p> After committing nearly $1 billion to build new factories in Russia, most Western tobacco companies have been hit with heavy losses since financial turmoil took hold this summer, but they say they will remain in the market until the economy picks up again. </p> <p> Russia's debt default and devaluation of the ruble in mid-August devastated consumer purchasing power, and since then foreign tobacco companies have seen a drastic decline in sales, losing ground to cheaper cigarettes made by Russian producers. </p> <p> This town was once the steel capital of the East, its namesake company turning out girders for the Golden Gate Bridge, Rockefeller Center and the Supreme Court building. But today Bethlehem is best known as a charming tourist spot of historic churches and ubiquitous Christmas decorations. </p> <p> The main evidence most visitors see of Bethlehem Steel's existence is the miniature wooden replicas of the old steel mill and of the company's former headquarters that are sold in gift shops around town. The shuttered mill may turn into a retail-and-restaurant complex, and the only vestige of steel is the office tower where Curtis Barnette, the company's chief executive, is leading a campaign to save the domestic steel industry -- and, he says, America. </p> <p> PALLADIUM FALLS 5.5 PERCENT.  Prices dropped from a five-month high, hurt by speculation that Russia, the leading producer of the metal, had increased year-end shipments. The March contract fell $18.10 an ounce, to $308.80. </p> <p> France and Britain conferred this week on the next steps to take in Iraq, but French officials said on Friday that wide differences still separated them. </p> <p> France would like Britain and the United States to agree in the United Nations Security Council to lift the oil embargo against Iraq if President Saddam Hussein consents to a new system of international arms monitoring. The French proposal has met with little success with the allies so far and, as a high-ranking French official said on Friday, there is not yet any certainty that Mr. Hussein will agree to a permanent control system. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration announced economic penalties today against three Russian institutions that it contends are helping Iran and possibly other nations develop nuclear weapons and missiles. The sanctions, imposed by executive order, mean that all American exports to the institutions, and all imports from them, are banned. </p> <p> The punishment was levied against the Mendeleyev Chemical Technical University in Moscow, the Moscow Aviation Institute, and the Scientific Research and Design Institute of Power and Technology. In announcing the sanctions, the national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, said Russia should develop an export-control system that is ''designed to work, and does.'' </p> <p> Russia, which is opposing any revival of the present arms inspection system in Iraq, today gave the Security Council a detailed blueprint for a new monitoring apparatus having much less independence. </p> <p> The United States representative here quickly rejected the plan. </p> <p> The White House told Congress tonight that President Clinton would not yet limit imports of foreign steel to the United States, despite the demands of steel unions and some producers, but would take a range of lesser actions intended to aid the industry. </p> <p> In a report to Congress submitted days after a Congressional deadline while Mr. Clinton and his economic team debated the politically charged issue, the White House said it would seek to extend a $300 million tax break for steel producers. That may provide some modest relief to the companies, but would be only of indirect help to the United Steelworkers of America, the politically powerful union that had demanded sharp limits on Russian, Japanese, Korean and Brazilian steel that it said is being dumped in the American market. </p> <p> Behind the closed doors of the United Nations Security Council, three of America's major partners are closing fast on their goal: to give Saddam Hussein victory in the war he lost eight years ago. </p> <p> The victory would not just establish Iraqi dominance in the Mideast, it would threaten the pragmatic reality of the Western alliance and America's role in it. And in words I choose with unhappy care: It would bring into vivid danger the purpose and existence of the U.N. </p> <p> The Clinton Administration announced an agreement with Russia today to strictly control its surging exports of steel to the United States, an attempt to balance the bitter complaints of American steelmakers with efforts to keep from worsening Russia's economic slide. </p> <p> Under the accord, Russia has agreed to roll back its sales of steel to the United States to the amount it shipped in 1996 and the first half of 1997, before a sharp fall in the value of the country's currency led to a surge of shipments here. Steel production accounts for 7 percent of Russia's gross national product, and is a huge source of scarce hard currency. </p> <p> PALLADIUM RISES.  Palladium futures soared amid concern that Russian delays in shipments will lead to a scramble among makers of cars and electronics. Palladium for March delivery jumped $10.25, to $351 an ounce. </p> <p> It is well after dark on a recent evening, but the red brick garment factory on a bluff overlooking the Sea of Japan is ablaze with light. From inside the building comes a haunting song, unfamiliar in this overwhelmingly Russian city: the seamstresses are singing in Chinese. </p> <p> Of the many incongruities born of the increasingly complex global economy, this may be among the strangest. For here at Russia's eastern extremity, Chinese workers labor alongside Russians making clothes for a South Korean company, which put its factory here partly to do an end run around United States quotas on apparel imports. </p> <p> SUGAR PLUNGES.  Sugar futures fell almost 4 percent amid signs of weakening demand from India and Russia, the world's biggest consumers. In New York, sugar for May delivery fell 0.24 cent, to 6.02 cents a pound. </p> <p> Azerbaijan has detained a Russian transport plane that was ferrying arms to Yugoslavia in violation of an international embargo, a senior Azerbaijani official said today. </p> <p> The official, Vafa Guluzade, chief foreign policy adviser to President Heydar Aliyev, said the transport plane was carrying six MIG jet fighters for the Yugoslav military. </p> <p> The key to raising the price of oil, OPEC has decided, is found more in politics than economics. </p> <p> After a decade of internecine fighting over which country should produce how much oil, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cut through a lot of haggling here on Tuesday to reach a production-cutting accord that was underpinned by the strength of newly arrived at political alliances. </p> <p> Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov of Russia responded today to NATO's decision to impose an oil embargo on Yugoslavia, saying Russia would continue to ship oil there ''in keeping with our international commitments.'' </p> <p> Mr. Ivanov's statement came against a backdrop of growing tensions between Russia and the Western alliance over the Yugoslavia bombing campaign. </p> <p> President Clinton demonstrated today just how delicate American and Russian relations are: He encouraged Russia to act as a mediator in the Kosovo conflict, even as he backed NATO's determination to choke off oil supplies to Yugoslavia -- a move that could stoke a confrontation with Russia. </p> <p> Russia has been absent from the NATO summit meeting here, boycotting the gathering because it profoundly objects to the NATO bombing of its Slavic cousins in Serbia. But the allies are turning to Russia to help broker a peace with the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic, and would welcome the contribution of Russian troops to any international security force that might move in to protect Kosovo Albanians. </p> <p> SUGAR PLUNGES.  Sugar prices plummeted on expectations that surging output from Brazil will overwhelm demand from buyers in Russia and Asia. In New York, sugar for July delivery fell 0.23 cent, to 4.52 cents a pound. </p> <p> PLATINUM FALLS.  Platinum fell on expectations that supplies from South Africa would keep users well stocked as delays in Russian exports drag on. In New York, platinum for July delivery fell $5.90, to $356.20 an ounce. </p> <p> In our last episode, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas reluctantly began to expound on his foreign-policy mindset. To continue: </p> <p> On our involvement in Kosovo: ''NATO has to be confident in its capacity to help preserve the peace in Europe. So I think it is in America's strategic interest in this case, that once we are in the position we got into, that Mr. Milosevic be taught a lesson.'' </p> <p> The new nations of the Caucasus and Central Asia will take a giant step away from their former masters in Moscow this weekend. </p> <p> Several Presidents and a host of other political and business leaders are expected to gather on Saturday at the Georgian port of Supsa for a ceremony opening a 515-mile pipeline that will carry oil from the Caspian Sea. By opening the pipeline, they will symbolically cut an old umbilical cord that has bound this region to Russia. </p> <p> SUGAR SOARS.  Sugar prices rose more than 8 percent, the biggest gain in six years, on speculation that Russia is stocking up on cheap supplies. In New York, sugar for July delivery rose 0.34 cent, to 4.42 cents a pound. </p> <p> A Russian relief convoy headed for Yugoslavia was stopped by Hungarian authorities today after they determined that it was carrying fuel and equipment that could be used by Belgrade's military, NATO officials said. </p> <p> The incident, which occurred as the convoy was trying to cross into Hungary from Ukraine, is the latest irritant in the rapidly deteriorating relationship between Russia and the Western alliance. </p> <p> NATO's political leaders have overruled a draft proposal by the alliance's senior commander to fire on ships that defy an oil blockade against Yugoslavia, raising questions about how effectively such an action can be enforced, officials said today. </p> <p> Although many countries are honoring the blockade, oil continues to arrive in Yugoslavia by sea. </p> <p> PALLADIUM DROPS SHARPLY.  Palladium prices fell nearly 3 percent amid signs that Russia has resumed export shipments after a four-month delay. In New York, palladium fell $8.25 an ounce, to $288.05. </p> <p> SUGAR RISES.  Sugar prices climbed on expectations that increased buying by Russia and other importers would soak up some of the excess supply. In New York, sugar for July delivery rose 0.23 cent a pound, to 5.52 cents. </p> <p> SUGAR RISES.  Sugar prices rose as stronger-than-expected demand from Russia absorbed increased exports from Brazil, the world's biggest grower. In New York, sugar for July delivery rose 0.16 cent, to 5.98 cents a pound. </p> <p> SUGAR FALLS. Sugar prices fell on signs that demand from Russia may be drying up at a time when growers in Brazil are harvesting a bumper crop. In New York, sugar for July delivery fell 0.14 cent, to 5.95 cents a pound. </p> <p> SUGAR SOARS.  Sugar prices rose to a two-month high as Russian importers accelerated purchases to avoid a tariff increase on Aug. 1. In New York, sugar for July delivery rose 0.25 cent a pound, or 4.8 percent, to 5.49 cents. </p> <p> President Clinton today greatly eased restrictions on computers that American companies can export to countries like Russia and China, arguing that advances in technology have made laptops and full-size personal computers just as powerful as the supercomputers of just a few years ago. </p> <p> Mr. Clinton's decision was a victory for American computer makers, which had lobbied aggressively for the change so they could export machines unfettered by regulations that have hindered their ability to make money overseas and have given their foreign competitors a big advantage. </p> <p> SUGAR PLUNGES. Sugar fell more than 6 percent amid weak demand from Russia and ample supplies from Brazil and Europe. In New York, sugar for October delivery fell 0.37 cent, to 5.37 cents a pound. </p> <p> Despite a booming American economy, President Clinton moved today to restrict imports of two politically sensitive products -- steel from Brazil and lamb from Australia and New Zealand -- in response to complaints from unions and farmers that their livelihoods were threatened by a surge of under-priced imports. </p> <p> Mr. Clinton has justified each of the moves as examples of how his Administration is enforcing dumping laws, a critical step, Administration officials say, to build support for open trade. But abroad, Mr. Clinton's decisions are viewed quite differently, as more evidence that the United States, while talking up the merits of free trade, is increasingly closing its borders to imports. </p> <p> Half the catch of North Pacific white fish, used everywhere from British supermarkets to McDonald's deep fryers, comes from 11 Russian supertrawlers. </p> <p> So a recent decision by the Russian Government to void a contract with a Russian-United States fishing joint venture and transfer its ships and catch quotas to a debt-ridden Russian rival has roiled the multibillion-dollar fishing industry and raised the possibility that foreign creditors will seize the ships. </p> <p> For five years now the Clinton Administration has gone to extraordinary lengths to keep countries from defaulting on loans to investors around the world, fearing that national bankruptcy can set off political upheaval and international economic chaos. </p> <p> That is why the White House bailed out Mexico in 1995, and why Washington moved the financial heavens to rescue Thailand and South Korea (successfully) and Indonesia and Russia (not exactly victories for American-style capitalism). </p> <p> Irritated by allegations of money laundering, some of Russia's leading businessmen insist that the West has overlooked a simpler explanation for the billions of dollars that have flowed through several suspicious accounts at the Bank of New York. </p> <p> While acknowledging that some Russian money stashed abroad may have been gained from organized crime or other criminal activity, they suggest that many of the thousands of transactions now under investigation can be attributed to Russian importers engaged in old games of dodging Russian tariffs and taxes. </p> <p> Hopes faded today that the Security Council could agree this week on a new approach to Iraq, with the United States and Russia still far apart on how to monitor Iraqi weapons programs and on when -- or if -- to begin lifting sanctions. </p> <p> American and British officials said today that meetings would continue this week to explore compromises on outstanding issues like how to measure Iraqi cooperation and how much control the United Nations would have over money Iraq would earn if sanctions were suspended. </p> <p> What the United States hoped would be a quick and painless renewal of the program under which Iraq sells limited amounts of oil to pay for goods to relieve civilian hardships turned today into complicated negotiations when Russia proposed changes favorable to Iraq. </p> <p> The extension of the ''oil for food'' program for another six months requires Security Council action by the end of the week. American diplomats hoped that approval would be more or less automatic, so that the council could concentrate on the larger issue of agreeing on a new arms inspection system for Iraq. </p> <p> A new arms inspection plan that could lead to the suspension of nine years of sanctions against Iraq sometime next year may go to the Security Council for debate on Wednesday, Western diplomats said today. British and American envoys, augmented by State Department officials, spent today trying to build a consensus that would avoid a Russian veto. </p> <p> Diplomats said that on Wednesday that the foreign ministers of key Security Council countries, including Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov of Russia, would discuss the proposals by telephone. </p> <p> Russian officials reacted angrily today to Western condemnation of their military tactics in Chechnya, warning that threats to impose sanctions or interrupt aid are unacceptable. </p> <p> Several officials insisted that Russia was feeling the effects of the criticism through a decision by the International Monetary Fund to postpone the delivery of a $640 million credit. </p> <p> PALLADIUM RISES. Palladium prices climbed to a record after Russia, which produces two-thirds of the world's supply, raised an export tax. In New York, palladium for March delivery rose $5.65 an ounce, to $430.65. </p> <p> Hours before the Security Council was to vote today on a new arms-inspection system for Iraq, France suddenly asked to stop the clock, stunning council members and irritating some by calling for more talks on a resolution that had been under discussion for more than six months. </p> <p> A United Nations official described the move as tragic, coming as it did just after Russia's deputy representative here, Gennadi Gatilov, told reporters that Russia would abstain, thereby removing the threat of veto from a measure that could send arms inspectors back to Iraq for the first time in a year. </p> <p> Rolf Ekeus, the Swedish arms-control expert who found and destroyed large quantities of Iraqi weapons after the war in 1991 in the Persian Gulf, was called back today by Secretary General Kofi Annan to lead a new commission created to finish the job more than a year after monitoring broke down. </p> <p> Mr. Annan made the appointment after a deadline on Sunday came and went for the Security Council to come up with its own nomination. But in selecting Mr. Ekeus without achieving consensus in the council, the secretary general was in effect daring Iraq's supporters on the council, particularly Russia and China, to veto his choice. </p> <p> PLATINUM RISES. -- Platinum futures rose 1.8 percent to a 2 1/2-year high after Russian exporters said shipments were being delayed. In New York, platinum for delivery in April rose $8.20, to $453.80 an ounce. </p> <p> Oman has agreed to accept the Russian tanker seized by two American warships that were enforcing United Nations sanctions against Iraq, a Pentagon official said today. </p> <p> Oman is letting the Maritime Inspection Force escort the Russian-flagged tanker, which is suspected of smuggling oil out of Iraq, to one of its ports, where officials will await the results of a laboratory analysis of an oil sample to determine its origin, the official said. </p> <p> PALLADIUM SURGES. Palladium had its biggest gain in 19 months, after export restrictions by Russia limited supplies. In New York, palladium for March delivery rose $52.85, or 8.7 percent, to a record $658.35 an ounce. </p> <p> Two American warships enforcing United Nations sanctions against Iraq seized a Russian tanker in the Persian Gulf today after boarding it and discovering evidence that it might be smuggling oil out of southern Iraq, a Pentagon spokesman said. </p> <p> A lightly armed boarding party from the guided missile cruiser Monterey landed on the tanker by helicopter on Wednesday after repeated attempts to get the tanker to respond to radio queries about its cargo, said the spokesman, Rear Adm. Craig Quigley. </p> <p> PLATINUM ADVANCES. Platinum surged to a 10-year high as a shortfall of supplies from Russia forced manufacturers to draw from stockpiles. Platinum for April delivery rose $31.10, or 6.2 percent, to $529.60 an ounce. </p> <p> In a stinging and unusual disappointment for United States steel producers and workers, a federal trade agency refused today to levy punitive import duties on a variety of steel products from Japan and five other countries. </p> <p> The ruling, by the United States International Trade Commission, cancels plans by the Commerce Department to impose duties on hundreds of millions of dollars worth of imported cold-rolled steel, which is used in a wide spectrum of products from cars to household appliances. </p> <p> PALLADIUM FALLS. Palladium prices dropped after Russia approved export quotas and signaled an end to a prolonged delay in shipments. In New York, palladium for June delivery fell $24, or 3.5 percent, to $658.90 an ounce. </p> <p> A Russian tanker chartered by one of the world's largest oil companies, Royal Dutch/Shell Group, was carrying Iraqi oil on April 5 in violation of the international embargo against Iraq when it was stopped by American sailors, American and company officials said today. </p> <p> The United Nations has fined the company $2 million, after determining that some of the the 78,000 metric tons of oil aboard the tanker came from Iraq. The tanker, the Akademik Pustovoit, was boarded by American-led naval forces in the Persian Gulf three weeks ago. </p> <p> PLATINUM DROPS. Platinum fell on a report that Russia, the world's second-biggest supplier, resumed exporting the metal after a yearlong halt. In New York, platinum for July delivery fell $9, or 1.9 percent, to $462.80 an ounce. </p> <p> PLATINUM DROPS. Platinum fell after the Russian mining company RAO Norilsk Nickel said it had resumed exports after a yearlong halt. In New York, platinum for July delivery fell $22.50, or 4.9 percent, to $440.30 an ounce. </p> <p> PLATINUM SURGES. Platinum rose as jewelers and other users of the metal awaited deliveries from Russia to ease tight supplies. In New York, platinum for July delivery rose $24, or 5.5 percent, to $462.10 an ounce. </p> <p> PLATINUM FALLS 6 PERCENT. Platinum declined on expectations that Russia would resume exports after more than a yearlong halt. Platinum for delivery in July fell $29.60, to $462.90 an ounce, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. </p> <p> PLATINUM RISES. Platinum rose 2 percent as traders continued to expect tight inventories and no new supply from Russia. In New York, platinum for July delivery rose $10.80, to $541.50 an ounce. </p> <p> The United States asked the Security Council today to impose sanctions on Ethiopia and Eritrea until fighting stops along their border. </p> <p> The proposed resolution would prohibit the sale or delivery of all kinds of weapons and military equipment to either side. It would also bar senior Ethiopian officials from international travel. </p> <p> The Security Council has imposed an arms embargo on Ethiopia and Eritrea in the hope that it will spur the two sides toward a resumption of peace talks. </p> <p> In a unanimous vote near midnight on Wednesday, the council barred sale and delivery of arms and other military equipment to the two countries for 12 months -- or until Secretary General Kofi Annan is able to report ''a peaceful, definitive settlement of the conflict.'' </p> <p> President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine used the occasion of a brief visit by President Clinton today to announce that the Chernobyl nuclear power station, site of the worst radiation accident in history, would be closed by Dec. 15. </p> <p> Mr. Kuchma made the announcement after the two leaders met in the white-and-gilded splendor of the Mariinsky presidential palace. ''This is a hopeful moment,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''It is also a moment when we remember those who suffered as a result of the accident there.'' </p> <p> Don't look now, says Viktor Petukhov, but that Russian economy the world wrote off as a basket case two years ago is roaring back to life. </p> <p> He is certainly right about the roaring part. </p> <p> When Russia began picking apart its economy in 1992, Oleg Nasobin spotted an opportunity. After 70 years of Soviet deficits, his country was brimming with pent-up demand for lipstick, face creams and body lotion. It was a business opportunity he could take up only by leaving. </p> <p> That year, Mr. Nasobin packed his family off to Prague. He was looking to build a business on safe ground, away from the constantly shifting turf of Russia's early days of capitalism. He also was leaving his home -- the place that would later make him a wealthy man. </p> <p> The presidents of China and Russia denounced the United States's proposed missile defense program in a joint statement today and vowed to strengthen a strategic partnership between their nations. </p> <p> But the first day of their summit meeting produced no substantive economic agreements, which Western scholars said pointed to a fundamental flaw in that partnership. Trade ties are more binding than talk in the post-cold-war era, and Russia cannot compete with what the United States, Europe or Japan can offer China these days, they said. </p> <p> PALLADIUM PLUNGES. Palladium fell on speculation that Russia, the world's largest producer, would resume exports to Japan. In New York, palladium for September delivery fell $63.05, or 7.4 percent, to $792.10 an ounce. </p> <p> The United States and Russia have agreed to work together to draft and win support for expanded sanctions against Afghanistan, officials said today. The cooperation aims to force the ruling Taliban to end support of Islamic terrorists, the officials said. </p> <p> The pledge to expand United Nations sanctions against the Taliban, who control about 85 percent of Afghanistan, was among several measures endorsed in principle by a senior working group of American and Russian officials after two days of talks in Washington. </p> <p> As some Security Council members, led by Russia and the United States, move toward increasing sanctions on the militant Islamic government of Afghanistan, a report by the United Nations' relief coordinator there says that the existing economic embargo is having ''a tangible negative effect'' on efforts to help the Afghan people. </p> <p> A survey in mid-August by relief officials found that sanctions imposed in 1999 are stifling what international trade was left in a country still shattered by more than 20 years of civil war, severe drought and the frequently self-defeating economic strictures of the Taliban, the strict Islamic movement that seized power four years ago. </p> <p> The Central Intelligence Agency says Iraq has consistently used the United Nations' oil-for-food program to reward countries that call for ending economic sanctions against Iraq, and to punish those that oppose lifting the embargo, administration officials familiar with the findings have said. </p> <p> The officials said the C.I.A. stated in a new report that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has given the bulk of contracts in the program to China, France and Russia, as well as to other vocal champions of lifting the sanctions. The Security Council imposed the sanctions after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 to force Iraq to give up weapons of mass destruction. </p> <p> Rich nations claimed a breakthrough today in their battle against high oil prices after persuading several oil-producing countries to join them in calling for cheaper crude. But their intensive campaign to stabilize commodity and currency markets awaited the verdict of traders on Monday. </p> <p> Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Russia and the United Arab Emirates joined the Group of 7 industrialized nations and other members of the committee that governs the International Monetary Fund in condemning current oil prices as harmful. Their agreement did not constitute a binding commitment, but financial officials presented it as tangible progress before OPEC holds a meeting in Caracas, Venezuela, this week. </p> <p> A small Soviet-era factory called Oktava has a well-known fan: the musician Sting. The reason? Its microphones. </p> <p> The company, based in this small city three hours south of Moscow, was focused primarily on weapons production in Soviet times. But since the 1950's, when Moscow ordered mass production for everything from recording studios to telecommunications equipment, it has been making microphones that have lately found an unlikely global success. </p> <p> In a concession to nations seeking to soften restrictions on Iraq, the Clinton administration agreed today to reduce the amount of money being set aside to compensate victims of Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The money saved from the compensation fund would be used for relief projects for Iraqis. </p> <p> In return, Russia and France will allow a disputed reparations claim of $15.9 billion to be paid to the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation. </p> <p> Insisting that it has never recognized an embargo on civilian air travel to Iraq, France today let a group fly from Paris to Baghdad. </p> <p> The flight, soon after two Russian flights to Baghdad, appeared to be intended to force the Security Council to reconsider its ban on air travel, which is part of the comprehensive sanctions that the United Nations imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. </p> <p> The far north of Russia is an inhospitable sheet of ice and snow more than half the size of the the 48 contiguous United States. But to Russian and foreign energy companies hungry for new supplies, the lure of profits has started to make the region inviting. </p> <p> With huge reserves of oil and natural gas beneath frigid seas, the Russian Arctic is one of the last untapped treasure-troves of fuel. And the rising price of fuel has made the industry more confident that the risk and expense of getting it are justified, for Russia's needs and for export. </p> <p> In June 1995, Vice President Al Gore signed a secret agreement with Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, then the Russian prime minister, calling for an end to all Russian sales of conventional weapons to Iran by the end of 1999. </p> <p> But the deadline passed with no sign of a halt to such sales, despite repeated complaints late last year and this year to senior Russian officials by Mr. Gore, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott. Moscow continues to be a significant supplier of conventional arms to Tehran despite the Gore-Chernomyrdin deal, the Central Intelligence Agency reported in August. </p> <p> State Department officials told Congress today that a 1995 deal approved by Vice President Al Gore allowing Russia to sell a large cache of conventional weapons to Iran was legal and did not threaten American security. </p> <p> The agreement, signed in 1995 by Mr. Gore and Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the former Russian prime minister, exempted Russia from a law requiring that economic sanctions be imposed on countries that sell arms to nations that sponsor terrorism, including Iran. </p> <p> Gov. George W. Bush said today that he was troubled by a report that Russia was continuing to deliver conventional arms to Iran in violation of a deal signed by Vice President Al Gore in 1995. </p> <p> Republican members of Congress also reacted angrily to the report, published today in The New York Times. It said that Mr. Gore entered into an agreement with Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister then, that in essence exempted Russia from a 1992 law requiring sanctions against nations that sell advanced weapons to countries that sponsor terrorism, including Iran. </p> <p> It has been half a year since the United States relaxed the 1987 embargo on Iranian carpets, caviar and pistachio nuts in what it called a goodwill gesture toward improved relations with Iran. But so far, only the carpets have had a renaissance in the American market -- which is good news for some people, bad for others. </p> <p> Iran's Caspian caviar was once revered as the finest, but no longer, said Bruce Sobol, co-owner of Caviarteria Inc. of New York, a leading importer and distributor of Caspian caviar: ''It's not markedly better than Russian, there's less of it, and it's more expensive.'' He is, however, receiving inquiries from customers eager to buy ''because it has been unavailable.'' </p> <p> Russia has notified the Clinton administration that it intends to withdraw from a 1995 agreement negotiated by Vice President Al Gore limiting Russian sales of tanks and other conventional weapons to Iran, officials said today. </p> <p> The Russian foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, told Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright of the intended action four days before the presidential election. </p> <p> Allied Domecq P.L.C. said today that it had secured the right to distribute Stolichnaya vodka in the United States from the brand's Russian owner and supplier Soyuzplodimport. </p> <p> The agreement adds to doubts that already existed about Allied's intentions for its bid on the wine and spirits business of the Seagram Company. Allied said three weeks ago that it had won the distribution rights to Captain Morgan rum, though that  statement has been disputed by Seagram, which says it owns the rights. </p> <p> Russia plans to ask Washington next month to change trade rules that have reduced steel exports to the United States by as much as 90 percent since 1998. </p> <p> Russian government officials met today with 26 of the country's largest steel producers to map out a strategy for easing quotas and revising the way minimum prices are calculated and give Russian metal better access to the vast American market. </p> <p> The United States and Russia asked the Security Council today to toughen and broaden sanctions against the Taliban government of Afghanistan, measures that would cut the country off from most contact with the world. </p> <p> The common ground taken by the Russians and Americans in demonizing the Taliban follows their taking exactly opposite sides in the catastrophic civil war that followed the Soviet invasion of 1979. </p> <p> Armen Petrossian likes to think of himself as being to caviar what, say, De Beers is to diamonds. </p> <p> Ever since his father and uncle fled to Paris more than 80 years ago to escape the turmoil of the Russian Revolution, the family has been running a business that along with a handful of other companies handles most of the West's imports of caviar from the Caspian Sea. That region accounts for about 80 percent of all the caviar sold in Western Europe and North America. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia brought his capitalist road show to Canada's business capital today, promising investor security, low tax rates and renewed economic growth. </p> <p> ''Attracting foreign investment is seen by us as a major factor for integrating Russia in the world economy,'' Mr. Putin told a luncheon audience of nearly 2,000 people. ''We have expanded the legal framework to improve protection of investors' rights.'' </p> <p> Led by the United States and Russia, the Security Council imposed harsh new sanctions on the Taliban government of Afghanistan today, leaving the United Nations profoundly split over the human and political damage the measures could inflict on one of the world's poorest nations. </p> <p> The vote in the 15-member Council was 13 for the embargo, with China and Malaysia abstaining. </p> <p> President-elect George W. Bush said today that he planned to review and possibly roll back some of the most ambitious initiatives that President Clinton has taken in recent days, including regulations that put nearly 60 million acres of the nation's forests off limits to development. </p> <p> ''I understand the Western mentality, and I want the Western mentality represented in this administration,'' Mr. Bush said of his own land use policies. In an interview, he emphasized that ''we've got lawyers looking at every single issue, every single opportunity'' to reverse actions Mr. Clinton has taken in the waning weeks of his presidency. </p> <p> On his first overseas trip as America's chief diplomat, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell plunged into talks today with the Russian foreign minister over differences on plans for a missile defense. They agreed to hold an expert-level dialogue on both offensive and defensive weapons, officials on both sides said. </p> <p> The 90-minute discussion with Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov, who met General Powell at his initial stop in Cairo, was part of a three-day tour by General Powell of five Arab countries, the Palestinian territories and Israel. The Bush administration describes the tour as part of a reassessment of American policy in which it hopes to gain new support for sanctions against Iraq. </p> <p> Faced with its first outbreak in 20 years of foot-and-mouth disease, a virulent illness that infects animals with relentless speed, Britain said today that it was suspending all exports of live animals as well as milk and meat, even though the disease poses small risk to humans. </p> <p> British officials said they moved after consulting officials from the European Commission, which later went a step further, saying the ban would last at least until March 1. </p> <p> After four years of talks, General Motors has struck an agreement to manufacture automobiles in Russia. </p> <p> Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chairman, announced the venture today at the auto show in Geneva. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is to arrive here on Monday to cement deals for his hard-pressed economy. It is the first visit by a Russian leader since Boris N. Yeltsin came in 1992. </p> <p> The Russians are just as eager now to expand economic ties, and to find a way to pay off debts that have grown to $1.8 billion. But they may also be looking for a chance to expand their role on both sides of the demilitarized zone that has divided the peninsula since the Korean War. </p> <p> George W. Bush's foreign policy so far has made three mistakes and missed one opportunity. </p> <p> 1. Pretending the easing of economic pressure on Iraq is the imposition of ''smart sanctions.'' Apparently Bush has decided to cave in to France, Russia and Syria and permit resumption of business-as-usual with Saddam Hussein. The trick is to acquiesce while looking fierce; hence our pinprick bombing of radar sites. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin called on Europe and the NATO alliance today to work with Russia on developing a common defense against missile attacks and presented a set of proposals to the NATO secretary general, Lord Robertson, who is visiting Moscow. </p> <p> The proposals, calling for a mobile antimissile system that could be deployed rapidly and aimed in the direction of a threatening state, are another step in a diplomatic campaign to convince both Europe and the United States that the missile threat from so-called rogue states can be met through cooperative and limited defensive efforts. </p> <p> The fresh fish have vanished. This city of 400,000 on Russia's bleak Arctic coast worries about doing the same. </p> <p> It was not a natural or environmental disaster that denuded the bustling port of its lifeblood. Though heavily exploited, the waters of the Barents Sea are still among Europe's richest fishing grounds, and Russian-owned vessels still harvest a million tons of fish a year. </p> <p> After conducting ''serious investigations,'' China has rejected American allegations that Chinese companies helped improve Iraqi air defenses in violation of United Nations sanctions, the foreign minister said today. </p> <p> At a news conference on the second day of China's annual Parliament meeting, Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan also warned the United States of grave consequences if it sold Taiwan advanced weapons systems, an issue that may come to the forefront next month, when the United States is to decide on Taiwan's arms requests. </p> <p> Iraqi officials have begun to demand in recent months kickbacks and illegal commissions on contracts for food, medicine and other essential civilian goods bought from foreign companies under a supervised ''oil for food'' program, diplomats and United Nations officials said today. </p> <p> Awash in cash from high oil prices over the last year, Iraq has become an attractive market for numerous foreign companies, some of which are apparently willing to pay for the privilege of securing business there, officials and diplomats here said. </p> <p> This was supposed to be a stellar year for Brazil's cattle industry. Calf birth rates are up. Mortality is falling. Productivity is at an all-time high. With about 165 million head, Brazil has the largest commercial herd of cattle in the world. And in the last decade, the country has gone from being a net importer to the world's third-largest exporter of beef, behind only the United States and Australia. </p> <p> Even the panic throughout Western Europe over mad cow disease, which is believed to be spread through feed containing parts of infected animals, was seen as advantageous for Brazil. With Europe's usual customers -- places like Russia, the Czech Republic and Egypt -- banning imports from some or all infected countries, Brazil's beef producers were preparing a marketing campaign that would announce to the world that their cows were grass-fed and disease-free. Depressed beef prices were not seen as much of a problem, since Brazil's beef is among the cheapest around. </p> <p> By the standards of authoritarian post-Soviet republics, it was a bit of an eye-opener: an illustration in a newspaper here depicted the prime minister, the energy minister, his deputy and the head of the state oil company all smiling as they carried a big length of oil pipe emblazoned with Chevron's logo across the Kazakh steppes. </p> <p> The theme of the illustration -- that Chevron has close, deep ties to the Kazakh leadership and wields immense influence -- would certainly not have come as a surprise. Chevron is a major oil producer here and has been one of Kazakhstan's most valued foreign investors since the early days of independence. The president of Chevron's Eurasia unit,  Guy Hollingsworth, says its relations with the government are ''excellent''; a top executive of Kazakhoil, the state oil company, was once a Chevron trainee. </p> <p> The United States banned imports of animals and animal products from the European Union today after learning that foot-and-mouth disease had spread to France from Britain. </p> <p> The Agriculture Department said it was taking the precaution to protect the domestic industry from a possible outbreak of the virus, which could cost the American industry billions of dollars in just one year. </p> <p> Oil began to flow today into the first major export pipeline linking Kazakhstan's Caspian oil fields to world markets, after the prime minister, Kasymzhomart Tokayev, formally opened a valve at a ceremony in Atyrau. </p> <p> The 900-mile pipeline from the Tengiz field to the Russian port of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea, built by an international consortium at a cost of $2.6 billion, will carry 600,000 barrels of oil a day by the end of the year, and eventually 1.5 million barrels a day. The first oil will finally reach the far end of the pipeline and be loaded onto a tanker in late June. </p> <p> President Bush and Japan's prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, met today to discuss joint strategies for restoring growth to the world's two largest economies but ended the session with only a vague commitment by Japan to confront its problems. </p> <p> ''The interrelationship between our two economies is important,'' Mr. Bush said at a brief photo opportunity with Mr. Mori, noting that the two countries account for roughly 40 percent of the world economy. ''The stronger we are, the more likely it is there will be prosperity in other parts of the world.'' </p> <p> So what are the lessons from this latest China-U.S. crisis? They are: (1) When dealing with China, carry a big stick and a big dictionary. (2) This is an inherently unstable relationship. (3) Get used to it -- it's going to be this way for a long time. </p> <p> Let's start with Lesson 2, because it's the crux of the matter. We learn from this incident that the U.S.-China relationship has within it two highly stabilizing and two highly destabilizing elements, and the future will be shaped by the balance between them. </p> <p> Zhou Jing's view of the United States as dangerous and domineering has hardened since American warplanes bombed China's embassy in Belgrade two years ago and an American spy plane more recently collided with a Chinese fighter jet off this country's southern coast. </p> <p> ''The embassy bombing had a huge impact on me,'' said Mr. Zhou, 21, sitting in an American-style cafe across from Fudan University, where he is a student. Though he hopes to study in the United States someday and has no quibble with the American public, he said the bombing confirmed his view of the American government as unreasonable and arrogant. </p> <p> Russia is expected to lead a drive this month to persuade the Security Council to impose sanctions on Pakistan, the strongest supporter of Afghanistan's militant Islamic government, the Taliban, diplomats and United Nations officials say. </p> <p> The Russian campaign, coming after two rounds of United Nations sanctions against the Taliban, has the potential to place the Bush administration in a quandary. </p> <p> The Russian government has approved a huge merger that unites most of the country's sprawling aluminum industry in a single giant company second in output only to Alcoa of America. </p> <p> The company, Russian Aluminum, is now moving rapidly to consolidate its control of plants throughout Russia, changing the face of the industry here. And though the deal has been criticized for reducing competition in the domestic market, most analysts consider it a step forward in Russia's start-and-stop economic development. </p> <p> Our turboprop Aries reconnaissance aircraft is designed to fly slowly, to listen and observe while aloft for 12 hours. Lumbering along at about 350 m.p.h., the plane that is now impounded by China was being buzzed, shadowed and harassed by a couple of Chinese F-8 fighter jets capable of nearly three times its speed. </p> <p> One of the Chinese jets positioned itself in front of the Aries (the name, stargazers know, is Latin for ''the  ram''). Is it possible that our pilot, with a crew of 23 aboard, deliberately surged ahead to ram the fighter? That makes no sense; even if the slow plane could catch the much faster one, such a maneuver would be suicidal. </p> <p> The American slowdown is damaging many other economies around the world, forecasters from more than 60 countries said in a report today. </p> <p> Particularly vulnerable are Asian nations with high-technology industries that had just begun to recover from the 1997 regional crash. Mexico and Canada, however, are also paying the price of being closely linked to the United States in trade and investment, the experts said. </p> <p> Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a skeptic of President Bush's plan for a missile defense system, said today that he would seek to broaden the debate over the strategy when he takes over next week as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. </p> <p> Mr. Biden, Democrat of Delaware, said the decision on building a missile shield was the most significant national security issue that confronts American policy makers. Aides said the issue was central to the senator's decision to accept the chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee instead of heading the judiciary panel when control of the Senate shifts to the Democrats. </p> <p> Russia threw an unexpected roadblock today in the path of an American and British proposal to allow free trade in civilian goods with Iraq while tightening controls on military imports. </p> <p> On the first day of Security Council debate on the plan, Sergey Lavrov, the Russian ambassador, produced a counterproposal that would put off a decision for six months. China and France also cautioned against haste, threatening to derail or stall Council action well beyond the June 3 deadline set by Britain, the sponsor of the resolution, and the United States. </p> <p> Ever notice that overhead compartments in Boeing planes now fit big rolling carry-on suitcases? Russian designers made it happen. </p> <p> Wonder why planes don't have beds on long flights? Russian engineers are working on it. </p> <p> A proposal by the United States and Britain to loosen restrictions on trade with Iraq while tightening controls against oil smuggling and illegal arms sales is meeting strong opposition in the Security Council and is unlikely to be adopted soon. </p> <p> In fact, the United States has agreed to extend the current system by at least a month, while Russian and other experts examine a revised list of goods which Iraq may not import, a high-level American official told the news agency Reuters tonight. </p> <p> Sir John Browne, the chief executive of the BP Group, said today that the Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline from Azerbaijan to a port on Turkey's southeastern Mediterranean coast would be built and operating by the end of 2004, the strongest public backing the project has yet received. </p> <p> Sir John said a detailed engineering study that began last month was not a further evaluation of the pipeline's economic viability, but a determination of what sort of line could be built within the project's budget, which he said was about $3 billion. </p> <p> To the delight of epicures but the annoyance of ecologists, the United Nations agency that oversees trade in endangered species today rejected a ban on Caspian Sea caviar proposed by a scientific advisory body. </p> <p> But the agency, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, gave the countries bordering the Caspian, which accounts for about 80 percent of the caviar sold in Western Europe and the United States, until year-end to reach an agreement on the improved management of sturgeon resources and to conduct a survey of caviar stocks. </p> <p> MARKETS have short memories, and the mourning of the latest boom-gone-bust is usually brief. In the nearly three years since Russia defaulted on its debt, investors have moved on -- first to the dot-com frenzy in the United States and then to its fizzle. Russia's derring-do tales of billions made and lost, of gun-toting tycoons and panic spreading across the globe have long since slipped from the headlines. </p> <p> Yet for much of the 1990's, the buzz surrounding emerging markets was intense, reflecting the fact that history was at a turning point: Russia was being sold off -- a former Communist superpower up for grabs in a way that would have once been inconceivable, especially considering that the country was a lumbering monster dripping with oil, diamonds, foreign money and, last but not least, nuclear weapons. </p> <p> The five major powers on the Security Council agreed today to postpone for 30 days a vote on a more generous trade policy for Iraq. </p> <p> The extension is intended to give experts time to evaluate a detailed list of items that the United States wants to prevent Saddam Hussein's government from buying unless it obtains international approval. </p> <p> CRUDE OIL FALLS. Crude oil fell after Russia said it would oppose tighter sanctions on Iraq, signaling Iraq may resume exports. In New York, crude oil for August delivery fell 27 cents, or 1 percent, to $26.98 a barrel. </p> <p> Secretary of State Colin L. Powell won support from France and China today for a plan to loosen restrictions on trade in civilian goods with Iraq, but he said that continued resistance from Russia made it unlikely that the proposal could be adopted at the United Nations by a deadline next week. </p> <p> Secretary Powell said Moscow had refused to ''engage'' on the issue and continued to insist that its commercial interests would be harmed. </p> <p> In the presidential election this month, Iranians voted overwhelmingly in favor of reform and democracy. The landslide victory of Mohammad Khatami, the candidate identified with reform, provides an opportunity for the United States to respond to the Iranian people's desire for change. The current stalemate in American-Iranian relations does not serve overall American interests. The United States should relax its economic sanctions against Iran and take other steps to foster an improved relationship, without weakening efforts to advance Middle East peace and prevent terrorism and the proliferation of nuclear weapons. </p> <p> Our current policy is focused on important American security interests -- combating terrorism and containing nuclear weapons -- but largely neglects our geopolitical, energy and economic interests. The sanctions, driven by the desire to isolate and punish Iran, have scant international support and have made it more difficult to advance our interests in the region around Iran. </p> <p> Breaking ranks with most human rights groups and the American government, Human Rights Watch said in a report today that the Taliban alone were not responsible for a deepening disaster in Afghanistan. </p> <p> Human Rights Watch, a New York-based organization, called for sanctions against the armed opposition to the Taliban, and blamed Russia and Iran for giving the opposition front significant military support. </p> <p> Russia, the world's second-largest oil exporter, is increasing its production and export of oil, just as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is seeking to cut back output. </p> <p> Russia's rising exports are threatening to frustrate OPEC's efforts to bolster the price of crude oil as economies, and demand, slow, industry analysts say. While OPEC has cut production quotas three times this year, for a total of 13 percent of daily output, Russia has increased production by 466,000 barrels a day, or 7 percent -- faster than any other non-OPEC country. Russia is the largest of the non-OPEC producers and is second only to Saudi Arabia. </p> <p> On the heels of a treaty of ''friendship and cooperation'' between China and Russia, Gazprom, the Russian gas monopoly, is planning to expand into China. </p> <p> While Gazprom, which is the world's largest gas monopoly, has been considering a venture in China for years, its interest has become more serious since the treaty was signed on July 16. Gazprom has been invited to bid on a $6 billion pipeline project in China, and the company is considering building its own pipelines to sell Siberian gas in Shanghai and Japan. </p> <p> For a lesson in 21st-century geopolitics, come to this border town, until just a few years ago an outpost for Russian infantry awaiting a Chinese invasion. </p> <p> Russian gun emplacements are crumbling now but the invasion is under way anyway: Chinese built the town's few new apartments, China Telecom connects the cellular phones, and Chinese traders hire busloads of jobless Russians to tote Chinese-made clothes and electronics through the Chinese-built border crossing. Maybe 1,000 of the 11,000 or so residents are Chinese, too. </p> <p> Breaking a logjam that has held up Western-led oil development in Russia for years, ExxonMobil said today that it was ready to spend $4 billion over five years to develop large offshore oil and gas fields in far eastern Russia. The project, which could grow to $12 billion over its life of 30 to 40 years, will be Russia's largest single foreign investment so far. </p> <p> In recent months the Russian government has been passing measures to clear the way for the project, which had languished since the mid-1990's awaiting new regulations and commitments to fixed tax rates that ExxonMobil called vital. </p> <p> Here are a few do's and don'ts that will help coalition-wary realists measure President Bush's success or failure at this week's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Shanghai. </p> <p> Don't get hung up in a free-trade love feast. Bush is not leaving his command post in terrorist wartime primarily to save the world from recession. Interminable blather about opening up markets is what China's Jiang Zemin wants most. The Chinese leader's diplomatic legions, drawn up in vast cumbrous array, will issue reams of plans for a ''Shanghai round'' of negotiations, but what makes this Bush trip necessary is getting, face to face, a promise of intelligence sharing about terror groups, to be followed by arrests and extradition. </p> <p> Russia, the world's second-largest oil exporter, is unlikely to reduce output or even slow its growth, despite pressure from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to fall in line with its attempts to shore up prices by restricting supply, analysts say. </p> <p> Russia made a small gesture in OPEC's direction this week when it agreed to bring together representatives of its biggest oil companies for talks on working with the cartel to prop up prices. But few in the industry see any prospect of concrete moves to rein in exports. </p> <p> Trade and terrorism will compete for top billing here beginning on Wednesday when 21 Asian and Pacific Rim countries formally open a series of meetings in what will be the largest gathering of government leaders since Sept. 11. </p> <p> The attacks and subsequent American airstrikes against Afghanistan have turned the Shanghai assemblage from a relatively toothless good-will exercise into a mildly contentious effort by the United States to strengthen its antiterrorism coalition in Asia. They have also added weight to the annual event, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which has in the past been best known, perhaps, for the closing photo opportunity, at which leaders put on shirts that reflect the culture of the host country. </p> <p> President Bush declared today that the two American soldiers killed in an accident on Friday -- the first major American casualties in South Asia -- ''died in a cause that was just and was right.'' He also told leaders of the 21 nations assembled here for an annual summit meeting that the terrorists who struck the World Trade Center were trying to bring about a collapse of world markets. </p> <p> It is the first time he has suggested that the terrorist network Al Qaeda was seeking to ''shatter confidence in the world economic system.'' He called on businesses around the world to join the fight against terrorism, while acknowledging that new security measures and limits on border crossings ran the risk of undermining world commerce. </p> <p> With the developed world nervously eyeing the security of oil supplies in the Middle East, Russia is stepping forward as a new friend in need. Alongside its support for the United States' military campaign in Afghanistan, Russia is offering its oil fields as a secure alternative to dependence on the turbulent Persian Gulf. </p> <p> Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union together produce about one-tenth of the world's oil and one-third of its natural gas. Russia's oil industry is booming, with exports up by 9 percent so far this year. Next week, production will begin at a northern gas field with reserves equal to two-thirds of all those in the rest of Europe. </p> <p> President Bush will decide in the next few days how deeply to slash America's nuclear arsenal as part of a new understanding with Russia on missile defense and strategic nuclear arms, officials said today. </p> <p> Together with economic incentives for Moscow, the reductions in nuclear arms are intended to be an inducement to the Russians to accept the Bush administration's program to test and develop antimissile defenses -- which are prohibited by the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty. </p> <p> In American eyes, Russia has taken on crucial importance as a world energy producer, and its role will grow even larger when the Russian government clears the way for extensive foreign investment in its energy sector, the United States secretary of energy, Spencer Abraham, said here today. </p> <p> ''Russia is emerging as a separate nucleus of the energy equation; we respect that,'' Mr. Abraham told reporters in a briefing today as part of a four-day visit to Moscow. As new investment unlocks more of its potential, he said, Russia will be put ''in a very strong position vis-à-vis world energy decision-making.'' </p> <p> Russia surprised world oil markets today by rebuffing OPEC's demands to cut oil output for 2002, postponing a decision until next month. </p> <p> In the meantime, Russian oil executives offered to trim 50,000 barrels off their daily exports, up from a previous pledge of 30,000 barrels, but far below the 500,000-barrel reduction that OPEC is demanding of outside producers. Meeting in Moscow with government officials, the executives said they would announce their final decision on 2002 exports in the second week in December. </p> <p> Oil prices went into free fall today as Russia, the world's biggest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia, rejected a challenge from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to stabilize prices by sharply cutting production. </p> <p> Prices in New York dropped 11.6 percent, to $17.45 a barrel, their lowest level in more than two years. Crude oil prices have fallen 21 percent this week. </p> <p> CHEKIB KHELIL, the president of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, will tell you that the only house he owns is in Potomac, Md. </p> <p> He is an Algerian, but he grew up in Morocco. When he is not directing OPEC, he runs Algeria's oil ministry, but his wife and two grown sons are American citizens. As he tries to reorganize the Algerian energy sector, he draws on his 20 years of experience in reforming the oil industries of Latin America as an official at the World Bank. </p> <p> The energy ministers of Russia and Mexico met here today to discuss whether to cut oil production to help prop up prices, but the talks made no apparent progress. </p> <p> The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has been pressing both countries, which are among the biggest non-OPEC oil exporters, to join it in reducing output. Russia responded with a promise of a trivial reduction; Mexico said it would make a substantial cut if others, like Russia and Norway, did the same. </p> <p> Creating the prospect of a devastating price war, OPEC said today that it would not cut production further unless major producers outside the group also decreased their output sizably by Jan. 1. </p> <p> OPEC had been widely expected to announce a reduction in output to bolster sagging oil prices. But at a meeting here today, officials said the group would be willing to pare daily production by 1.5 million barrels by the beginning of next year only if non-OPEC nations, including Norway, Mexico and Russia, also trimmed output by a total of 500,000 barrels a day. For the time being, that seems unlikely. </p> <p> Mexico, a nation with divided sympathies about how much oil should cost, is setting out on a round of shuttle diplomacy that analysts here said seemed intended to head off an oil price war. </p> <p> Ernesto Martens, Mexico's energy secretary, will fly to Moscow on Saturday for talks with Russia's energy minister, Igor Yusufov, and will then visit Norway. </p> <p> On the surface, it looked like big news: the Russian news service Interfax quoted Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov today as saying that a group of Russian oil companies might agree next week to reduce oil exports in support of the efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise oil prices. </p> <p> Western news agencies picked up the report, and traders started bidding crude prices up sharply. At one point they had risen 6 percent, the biggest move in more than a year, but they closed at a 5 percent rise, at $22.22 a barrel, up $1.05. </p> <p> A government oil commission here said today that Russia might make deeper cuts in oil exports beginning in January. </p> <p> The commission, which assigns export quotas to Russian oil companies, said in a statement that it would review technical possibilities in measures to make deeper cuts in oil exports. </p> <p> After an agreement between the United States and Russia, other major members of the United Nations Security Council agreed today to postpone changing the rules for sanctions on trade with Iraq for another six months, diplomats said, keeping the  existing ''oil for food'' program in force until then. </p> <p> The decision was dictated by the fact that the current sanctions regime expires on Friday, and not by any developments in Iraq or in the debate within the Bush administration on whether to expand its current campaign against terrorism to include a new assault on Saddam Hussein. </p> <p> Russia sent mixed signals today but no definitive word on whether it would cooperate with other oil exporters outside OPEC in cutting production. </p> <p> As a result, petroleum prices bounced around on each nuance, finishing the day somewhat lower after an early upward spike. The benchmark price for January delivery of light crude fell 19 cents, to $18.96 a barrel in New York trading today; it rose 72 cents a barrel on Tuesday on word that Mexico and Norway, the No. 2 and No. 3 non-OPEC exporters after Russia, had agreed to make much larger cuts if Russia would do the same. </p> <p> With China's membership in the World Trade Organization set to be sealed at the group's summit meeting in Qatar over the next few days, Russia remains the only big world power outside the global trade club. </p> <p> That is a major disappointment to Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin, who has made entry into the 142-country group a top priority. The Kremlin, which began its bid eight years ago, sees membership as crucial to its effort to remake its checkered reputation as a tough place to do business. </p> <p> Concerns over Russia's ability to transform its markets and come up with changes to its legal system that would help protect contract and property rights have shadowed several years of accession talks. </p> <p> President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia pledged today to cut their nuclear stockpiles by roughly two-thirds over the next decade, leaving each side with fewer than 2,200 warheads. </p> <p> But the two nations still seemed far apart on missile defenses, with Mr. Putin resisting American efforts for a quick agreement that would allow Mr. Bush to conduct tests that would violate the 1972 Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty. </p> <p> The people who run Russia's companies and oversee its economy did not draft a formal wish list of economic measures for President Vladimir V. Putin to raise with George Bush as they meet this week. That is because what they want from the United States can be boiled down to one point: stop treating Russia like an enemy economy. </p> <p> As Russia moves to integrate its economy with the rest of the world's, business leaders and government officials here say that more support is needed from America to smooth the way. American officials say that they are doing what they can, but that they cannot move faster than Congress and other countries' governments will allow. </p> <p> The Russian government said today that the country's oil industry had agreed to cut production, as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries had been pressing it to do. But for all the trumpeting the announcement was given, the size of the cut -- about one-half of 1 percent of Russia's daily output -- was so tiny that it will have virtually no effect on oil prices, analysts said. </p> <p> Executives from six large Russian oil companies agreed to the cut in a meeting this morning with Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, a government spokesman said. </p> <p> Russia remained the question mark in the standoff between OPEC and oil exporters outside the cartel after two of the largest nonmember exporters signaled today that an agreement was near to reduce output in hopes of propping up prices. </p> <p> After meeting in Oslo, the energy ministers of Norway and Mexico, No. 2 and No. 3 among exporters that do not belong to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, said they were in agreement on a plan for cutbacks, and that it was now up to Russia, which is No. 1, to make the plan succeed by reducing its daily production by ''a couple of hundred thousand barrels.'' </p> <p> Hoping to prevent the global economic slowdown from further eroding world oil prices, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries finalized an agreement today to cut back oil production by 6.5 percent, or 1.5 million barrels a day, for at least six months starting Jan. 1. </p> <p> The decision, made at an emergency meeting of OPEC ministers here, followed a pledge by non-OPEC oil producers -- principally Russia, Norway and Mexico -- to reduce their exports by 462,500 barrels a day. OPEC officials prompted the non-OPEC nations to act using barely veiled threats of a price war. </p> <p> Joe Mach talks Russian oil in an Oklahoma accent. </p> <p> After 30 years in the oil industry, most recently spent roaming across Europe and Africa, Mr. Mach (pronounced mack) last year joined Yukos, Russia's second-largest oil producer, as vice president for production and exploration. </p> <p> Russia agreed today to reduce crude oil exports by 150,000 barrels a day, a decision that could prompt production cuts by OPEC members and other nations. </p> <p> The move appeared to break a monthlong deadlock with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The cartel announced last month that it would pare daily oil production only if non-OPEC nations like Russia, Norway and Mexico followed suit, a call that Russia had  resisted until today. </p> <p> There is no oil in Afghanistan, but there are oil politics, and Washington is subtly tending to them, using the promise of energy investments in Central Asia to nurture a budding set of political alliances in the region with Russia, Kazakhstan and, to some extent, Uzbekistan. </p> <p> Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the United States has lauded the region as a stable oil supplier, in a tacit comparison with the Persian Gulf states that have been viewed lately as less cooperative. The State Department is exploring the potential for post-Taliban energy projects in the region, which has more than 6 percent of the world's proven oil reserves and almost 40 percent of its gas reserves. </p> <p> When President Vladimir V. Putin cuts the ribbon this week on the first half of a new oil loading facility on the Gulf of Finland, he will achieve part of a goal that has been animating Russian history since the time of Peter the Great: building and controlling its own outlets to the sea. </p> <p> The facility, at Primorsk, 100 miles northwest of St. Petersburg in the Leningrad region near the Finnish border, is meant to provide an  outlet for oil pumped by pipeline from fields in the vast Timan Pechora basin in Russia's far north. </p> <p> WHEN it went public in July 1998, the United States Enrichment Corporation was a bright light in the nuclear energy industry. </p> <p> The company, a former government agency, had a monopoly on uranium enrichment in the United States and was responsible for carrying out a government policy to convert Russia's military uranium into  commercial nuclear fuel. USEC, as the company is known, had annual sales of $1.4 billion, healthy profits and a promising future technology. It appeared to be an ambitious experiment in harnessing private sector energy to meet a public policy goal. ''The beauty of the program is that it disarms former weapons of mass destruction, and it does it through a mechanism that only works if you have a market price,'' said Robert J. Moore, USEC's general counsel. </p> <p> Russian oil companies are being squeezed by low prices on domestic crude oil after problems at a crucial port restricted export shipments and led to a glut on the weak domestic market. </p> <p> The price of crude in Russia, the world's second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia, has fallen to about $5 a barrel, half of what crude typically sells for at this time of year. The low prices are worrying Russia's big oil companies, which agreed late last year to trim exports of crude in the first quarter of 2002. Russia agreed to support an effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to shore up world prices by reducing its exports by 150,000 barrels a day, at a time of year when domestic consumption usually claims more of Russia's output anyway. </p> <p> Russia and Poland vowed today to let renewed trade and pragmatism warm the frost off their troubled past as President Vladimir V. Putin ended a two-day trip here -- the first by a Russian leader since 1993. </p> <p> Both leaders declared the meeting a success -- even though no single moment, no dramatic embrace or apology signaled a clear change between Russia and Poland, dominated for decades by the Soviet Union, and  now arguably the former Communist state closest to the West. </p> <p> In ''The Great Game,'' published just as the Cold War ended, Peter Hopkirk chronicled the struggle, throughout the 19th century and into the 20th, between Britain and Russia for influence, control and profit in Central Asia. The jewel in the crown was the Indian subcontinent; but the pathway to it ran through Afghanistan. Now the prize is oil -- getting it and transporting it -- and Afghanistan is again contested territory. The difference is that, this time around, it is the United States that will be playing the game with Russia. </p> <p> When the Soviet Union collapsed, it lost its southern provinces -- Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan. These states have oil and gas deposits that, taken together, are thought to be equal to the remaining reserves of Saudi Arabia and Iraq, America's two leading Middle Eastern suppliers of oil. </p> <p> President Bush may have plenty of reasons why Russia, his new ally in the war on terrorism, should stop cozying up to Iraq, one of the states he sees as part of an ''axis of evil.'' </p> <p> But Leonid Fedun has 20 billion reasons why Russia should not. </p> <p> Russia said today that it was keeping to the letter of its promise to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, reducing the official count of its exports of crude oil by 150,000 barrels a day. But oil production is still surging, exports of refined products are still rising, and few people here think there is any chance of export restraint after March 31, when the promise to OPEC expires. </p> <p> The Russian energy minister, Igor K. Yusufov, announced today that Russia had cut exports by the promised amount, and was now shipping  2.7 million barrels a day abroad. Official oil statistics have a far from ironclad reputation here, and most analysts prefer to compile their own figures. By most such counts, Russia has at least halted the growth in its exports; Petroleum Argus, a respected industry publication, said exports in January were unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2001. </p> <p> Steel producers from around the world angrily denounced President Bush's decision today to impose protective tariffs on imported steel and vowed to fight the plan at the World Trade Organization. </p> <p> More ominously for the Bush administration, many trade experts said today that the United States was on shaky legal ground. Over the last two years, the United States has lost at least three smaller cases in which it tried to restrict imports on the same legal principle cited in the steel case today. </p> <p> President Bush's top political and economic advisers, deeply divided on one of the most excruciating decisions of Mr. Bush's 14-month-old presidency, met today to begin drafting a compromise that would place high tariffs on some imported steel, but force the American steel industry to shoulder the costs of the retirement benefits of its workers. </p> <p> The meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House came as thousands of steel workers massed on the Ellipse, only a few hundred yards away, greeting a parade of Democratic and Republican senators who called for tariffs of no less than 40 percent on steel from Russia, Germany, China and other major steel-producing countries. Mr. Bush is set to announce his decision on Wednesday, in response to the International Trade Commission's ruling in December that American steel producers had been injured by foreign competitors. </p> <p> Russia made no promises one way or the other today to the leaders of OPEC, who had traveled here in hopes of persuading this country's oil industry to continue to hold back exports of crude. </p> <p> OPEC's secretary general, Alí Rodríguez, and its president, Rilwanu Lukman, met with Prime Minister Mikhail M. Kasyanov and executives from private Russian oil companies. The officials asked Russia to extend cuts in crude oil exports through the second quarter. </p> <p> Russia and the United States reached broad tentative agreement today on how to revise penalties against Iraq by lifting controls altogether on thousands of food products, aid supplies and medicines. </p> <p> At the same time, the two-day negotiating session between Assistant Secretary of State John Wolf and Yuri Fedotov of the Russian Foreign Ministry produced an agreement on common definitions for civilian products that might have military applications and would remain banned or subject to special review. </p> <p> Weary, perhaps, of tolerating American diktats on everything from steel exports to NATO expansion, Russian officials are poised to strike a retaliatory blow at one of the United States' soft spots: its thighs. Chicken thighs. </p> <p> Agriculture Minister Aleksei V. Gordeyev said today that his office had stopped issuing permits to import American chicken, the single most popular item from the United States. Within 10 days, he said, Russia may issue an outright ban against American chicken. </p> <p> Executives from Russia's biggest oil companies met with Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov today and agreed to extend through the second quarter the cuts of 150,000 barrels a day in the country's oil exports. </p> <p> The move was a gesture to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which has been trying to raise world oil prices by restricting supply. Russia is the biggest oil exporter outside OPEC, and its shipments rose steadily last year. In December, after months of pressure from OPEC, Russia agreed with Norway and Mexico, two other non-OPEC exporters, to hold down exports for three months. </p> <p> A trade dispute between Russia and the United States escalated today, as punitive American duties on steel from Russia -- and elsewhere -- brought angry words from officials and fresh statements about a ban on American poultry. </p> <p> The tariffs announced Tuesday by President Bush angered all the nations affected, including Japan and Germany. But in Russia, the steel duties were also seen as yet another humiliation, after disqualifications in the Olympic Games and talk of American troops in Georgia, one of Russia's least friendly neighbors -- despite Russia's support of America in its war against terrorists. </p> <p> Casting a vote of confidence in Russia's energy industry, BP has increased its stake in the Russian oil company Sidanco to 25 percent from 10 percent. </p> <p> The deal comes a little more than two years after the London-based BP came close to scrapping its investment in Sidanco altogether during a drawn-out legal battle over oil assets with two Russian companies that are now its partners in Sidanco. </p> <p> Russia agreed today to lift its ban on American poultry products by April 10 to end a three-week trade dispute that has cramped the two countries relations. </p> <p> In a briefing, the American ambassador, Alexander R. Vershbow, said that he and Russia's chief veterinary inspector, Mikhail Kravchuk, had signed a protocol today that contained a ''clear commitment'' by Russia to end the poultry ban before April 10. </p> <p> Stung by a lagging share price and waning investor interest, Russia's biggest oil producer, Lukoil, announced a program of cost-cutting and revamping today that it said would bring savings of $500 million annually. </p> <p> A central part of the program is a plan to sell its oil services operations. This would remove about 20,000 workers, or one-seventh of the staff, from Lukoil's books, Leonid Fedun, a Lukoil vice president, announced at a news conference. </p> <p> A Europe seething at Israeli raids into Palestinian territories delivered a mixed message to Secretary of State Colin L. Powell today, blending tough talk of trade sanctions and suspension of arms sales to Israel with a strong endorsement of the secretary's Middle East peace efforts. </p> <p> More than a decade after the Madrid peace conference began a promising era of diplomacy, Secretary Powell met foreign ministers here to try to stop the current bloodshed and salvage whatever shreds may remain of peace negotiations. </p> <p> Russian oil companies, overflowing with cash and crude, have begun snapping up ''downstream'' assets like pipelines and refineries outside Russia, mainly in the former Soviet bloc countries of Eastern Europe. </p> <p> Russia overtook Saudi Arabia in the month of February as the world's largest producer, and its steadily rising output is far beyond the amount domestic demand can absorb. The country's oil companies are moving to secure market outlets and captive customers for their crude. </p> <p> VAGIT ALEKPEROV gathered a group of analysts and bankers at the headquarters of Lukoil, the giant oil company of which he is chief executive, to lay out an ambitious corporate overhaul plan to reinvigorate its sluggish shares. </p> <p> The confidence-building session last month was the kind of theater that corporate leaders have worked hard to perfect. Senior executives promise extraordinary growth and profitability, then try to convince the crowd that they have the strategy and the ability to deliver. </p> <p> Russia's largest oil producer, Lukoil, said it will have trimmed about $100 million in costs by the end of the second quarter, reaping the first rewards from a corporate overhaul. </p> <p> At a news conference here today, a Lukoil vice president, Leonid Fedun, said that the savings had come from closing unprofitable wells, making oil well repair work more efficient, and improving the management of foreign oil assets. </p> <p> President Bush leaves early Wednesday morning for Europe, where he is almost certain to be greeted by demonstrators who believe him a bully and by allies in the campaign against terrorism who are increasingly unhappy about everything from steel tariffs to his determination to topple Saddam Hussein. </p> <p> But as he departs, his senior aides describe a very different man, who has learned important lessons about diplomacy in 16 months and whose early missteps, they say, provided the lessons that made possible the arms agreement with Russia that will be the centerpiece of his trip. </p> <p> When more than 800 business experts in 15 emerging-market countries were asked recently to identify the most flagrant bribe-payers in richer nations seeking contracts, Russian and Chinese companies emerged at the top of the list, according to a report this week from Transparency International, an independent anticorruption organization. </p> <p> Speaking at a news conference in Paris on Tuesday, Peter Eigen, chairman of the organization, said that in dealing with emerging-market countries, the Russians and Chinese were ''using bribes on an exceptional and intolerable scale.'' </p> <p> President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin agreed today to begin what Mr. Bush called a ''major new energy partnership,'' with more American investment in Russia's oil and gas industry and faster ways for its products to reach world markets. </p> <p> Today's joint statement, made in a gilded hall of the Kremlin, was seen by analysts more as an American nod to Russia's energy might than as an agenda for concrete action. </p> <p> Russia said today that it would stop holding down its oil exports and let them rise to former levels over the next two months. </p> <p> Russia agreed to impose the export limits in December under pressure from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which was trying to reverse a fall in oil prices by restricting supply. Russia initially promised to hold back exports for three months, and later extended the limits. </p> <p> With another oil shock looming thanks to Saddam Hussein's decision to suspend Iraq's oil exports and to the turmoil in Venezuela -- not to mention Saudi Arabia's recent, brief waving of ''the oil weapon'' -- the need to broaden the range of America's energy sources has become urgent. </p> <p> One underappreciated source is obvious: Russian oil. Russia is the world's single largest non-OPEC oil exporter, with 10 percent of currently known oil reserves and 9 percent of world output. Yet Russia's irregular, ''spot market'' deliveries to the United States are a fraction of 1 percent of American imports. By contrast, Iraq's share of American imports last year was 7 percent; between them, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iraq, OPEC members all, accounted for 34 percent. </p> <p> The seals of approval are coming thick and fast for President Vladimir V. Putin's Russia these days. </p> <p> Today, the European Union said it would recognize Russia as a market economy, an upgrading of its status under the union's trade regulations and a designation that Moscow had sought for years. In a statement, Romano Prodi, president of the union's executive body, the European Commission, called it ''fit and proper'' that the 15-nation union ''reward the considerable efforts'' Russia has made to remake its economy. </p> <p> President Bush and leaders of the major industrial countries ended their meeting today by committing billions of dollars in aid to African nations that successfully reform their economies and governments. But they offered only the vaguest assurances that they would dismantle the huge subsidies for their own farmers, which African leaders bitterly complain have undercut the ability of the poorest nations to compete in world markets. </p> <p> The agreement today, announced when the leaders of South Africa, Nigeria, Algeria and Senegal arrived for its formal adoption, might eventually provide more than $6 billion in yearly aid starting in 2006. But the program requires recipients to implement a wide range of reforms, in areas from government to education. </p> <p> Russian oil companies are still going strong, expanding their roles on international markets, despite last year's drop in the price of oil. </p> <p> Three of Russia's biggest oil companies reported their 2001 financial results this week. Though profits were generally down from the year before, all three said they would push ahead with plans to upgrade fields and build new pipelines. All three worked to polish up their sometimes scratchy relations with investors. </p> <p> President Bush told President Vladimir V. Putin by telephone today that the United States would begin regarding Russia as a market economy, a change in semantics that has significant practical consequences for Russian-American trade. </p> <p> The move, after a similar step last week by the European Union, addresses one of Moscow's main complaints about the West, that Russia's Communist past is used as an excuse to treat it unfairly in trade disputes. </p> <p> This small wedge of territory, part of Russia but separate from it, has haltingly begun to open up after spending decades as one of the Soviet Union's secret military zones, closed to the world. Now the greatest fear for Kaliningrad's residents is that it is about to close again. </p> <p> The enclave's two neighbors, Poland and Lithuania, plan to erect strict new barriers on their porous borders, imposing new visa and customs controls, as part of their efforts to join the European Union in 2004. </p> <p> A public relations maneuver by a Russian oil company went awry last week when a lawsuit over a seven-year-old debt surfaced in a Texas court. </p> <p> Yukos, Russia's second-largest oil producer, had just delivered its much-publicized first tanker of oil to the United States. But instead of payment and an image boost, Yukos received a restraining order blocking part of the payment for the oil. A Federal District Court in Houston froze the payment at the request of Dardana, which was organized in the Cayman Islands and calls itself an investment firm. </p> <p> Sakhalin, a verdant island in the Russian Far East, in the Sea of Okhotsk, is the eastern frontier of the expansion of the Russian oil industry. It is also Russia's first open door for foreign oil developers. </p> <p> Vast reserves of natural gas and oil and the location of the island -- just north of the energy-hungry markets of Japan and Korea -- have drawn multinational companies like the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, ExxonMobil and BP. </p> <p> Russia, the second-largest oil exporter, agreed today to help OPEC maintain oil prices but offered no new promises to reduce its exports. </p> <p> The secretary general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Álvaro Silva Calderón, on a one-day visit to Moscow, met today with the Russian energy minister, Igor K. Yusufov. </p> <p> In this tiny lumber village in the Canadian Rockies, people are more likely to take their vacations in Las Vegas or Disney World, retire in Arizona, drive Chevrolets and live in mobile homes imported from the United States. </p> <p> With the ties to the United States here so tight, disruptions in relations with the United States can hit as hard as a family squabble. And relations now are pretty raw. </p> <p> General Motors will cut the ribbon on Monday on a risky $340 million bet: that it can prosper in the Russian car market by building a new sport utility vehicle designed by its local partner, AvtoVAZ, Russia's largest and most controversial car company. </p> <p> The venture, which is meant to turn out 75,000 of the boxy Jeep-like vehicles a year by 2004, is the biggest foreign investment so far in Russia's struggling auto industry, and the second from Detroit. Ford Motor opened an assembly plant in St. Petersburg in July, opting to go it alone without a Russian partner. </p> <p> The Bush administration imposed penalties today on three Russian military contractors that sold weapons to countries that the State Department says support terrorism. </p> <p> The companies, all government owned, are said to have sold conventional military equipment like missiles and rocket-fired grenades to Libya, Sudan and Syria, officials said. The penalties mean that the companies will not be able to do business with the United States government, sell their equipment here or buy certain equipment and services from American businesses. </p> <p> The Yukos Oil Company, Russia's second-largest oil producer, said direct crude oil shipments to the United States appeared to be economical, and it would continue shipping oil through the end of this year. Yukos shipped a tanker of oil to the United States for the first time in July, though it later encountered problems after a pending lawsuit disrupted payment for the oil. </p> <p> Sabrina Tavernise (NYT) </p> <p> Alarmed by violence and political volatility in the Middle East, China's leaders are aggressively developing alternatives to oil from the region. But a booming economy and rising sales of cars may propel China, however reluctantly, into the same sticky embrace with Mideast oil producers that the United States, Japan and many other countries have accepted. </p> <p> China's transformation from a net exporter of oil as recently as 1993 to a big oil importer has made it more attuned to events in the Middle East. Even as the Bush administration steps up threats to attack Iraq, Baghdad has been wooing the Chinese. Iraq's foreign minister, Naji Sabri, has just met here with Deputy Prime Minister Qian Qichen and other high-ranking officials, and the Chinese reiterated their opposition to the use or threat of force against Iraq. </p> <p> Energy executives and government officials from Russia and the United States will meet in Houston next week to discuss energy cooperation at a time when concerns over the safety of world oil supplies have been heightened by the Bush administration's push for action against Iraq. </p> <p> The conference is expected to include a who's who of leaders of the Russian oil industry as well as executives from American energy companies. The secretary of commerce, Donald L. Evans, and the secretary of the Treasury, Paul H. O'Neill, are also scheduled to take part. </p> <p> With used cars to move, Fizul Haq enthralls wavering customers with visions of the delights of car ownership: a Friday picnic in a cool suburban garden, with grapes, card games, laughter and, on the tape deck, Indian love songs. </p> <p> Car sales are brisk, in part because of the silver tongues of Mr. Haq's sales team, but also because his location has gone through a radical upgrade. Here, in the cradle of the Taliban movement, American bombs last October blew up the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, across the street. </p> <p> Roxana Pourshapour was on a flight from Shiraz to Tehran last month when she smelled something burning. Then the oxygen masks dropped. </p> <p> ''Ladies and gentlemen, please stay calm and use the oxygen masks only if you have to,'' the pilot said over the loudspeaker, without further explanation. ''We are on our way back to Shiraz.'' </p> <p> While the United States courts western Russia as a new source of non-OPEC oil, Japan is looking to the Russian Far East, ensuring that Sakhalin Island will become a major supplier of oil and gas to Japan within a decade. </p> <p> In the largest foreign direct investment in Russian history, an expected $13 billion is starting to pour into two gas and oil projects here on Sakhalin Island, a Siberian Kuwait of hydrocarbons that begins only 25 miles above Japan's northern tip. </p> <p> If the U.N Security Council fails to adopt a resolution holding Iraq ''in material breach'' of its many disarmament agreements, that refusal will have consequences for the U.N. and several of its member nations. </p> <p> The State Department cannot say that, of course, because our diplomacy with Council members rests on persuasion, not threats. But should the U.N. deny the fact of Saddam's repeated and sustained defiance of its irresolute resolutions, the world body will henceforth play only in a little league of nations. </p> <p> As Russia defends its position during a two-day United Nations debate on Iraq, one thing will weigh on the minds of Russian diplomats: oil. </p> <p> Russian oil companies have extensive interests in Iraq that reach back to Soviet times, when the two countries were allied. Revenue from Russia's own oil production is crucial to the government's budget, making the country very sensitive to any sudden swings in world oil prices that might be touched off by military action. </p> <p> As the Bush administration lobbies Russia and other veto-bearing members of the Security Council to agree to a new resolution on Iraq, a delegation of Iraqi officials visited Moscow to appeal to business people and officials to resist the pressure. </p> <p> The six-member Iraqi delegation, which arrived in Moscow on Wednesday, included a deputy oil minister, deputy minister of industry and natural resources and the head of a state organization called the Society of Friendship, Peace and Solidarity With Foreign Countries. </p> <p> As Iraq confronts the possibility of a new war with the United States, its leaders appear to have concluded that they have one decisive advantage that they lacked during the countdown to the Persian Gulf war 12 years ago: this time, they seem convinced, the world is on their side and against the United States. </p> <p> ''The world has abandoned America; it has become isolated,'' Saddam Hussein's No. 2 man, Izzat Ibrahim, boasted as he announced the result of this week's election: Iraqis, by official reckoning, had re-elected Saddam Hussein to his position of absolute power as president with 100 percent of the 11.4 million votes cast. Along with other leaders in Baghdad, Mr. Ibrahim accused the United States of warmongering, threatening not only Iraq but the entire Middle East. </p> <p> Russia, whose economy is by far the largest outside the World Trade Organization, has hit an impasse in talks with major trading partners about joining the group. </p> <p> Trade officials from Russia, the United States and the European Union met in Moscow this week but failed to find common ground on a number of central issues, including Russia's low energy prices and its protection for its banks and telecommunications industry. The meetings were meant to prepare for multilateral talks next month at the organization's headquarters in Geneva on Russia's bid to join the group. </p> <p> The leaders of the United States, Russia, China, Indonesia and other nations are coming here this week to argue over Washington's campaigns against terrorist groups and what it calls rogue nations. </p> <p> The agenda of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference at this resort on the tip of the Baja peninsula has been transformed. The bombing in Bali, American calls for an end to Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq and North Korea's acknowledgment that it has been trying to build nuclear weapons have transformed trade talks into a war council. </p> <p> After a year of talk about how to make large-scale oil exports to the United States profitable, the Russian oil industry said today that it had settled on a plan -- a 1,550-mile pipeline to a new oil terminal at Murmansk, the Arctic deepwater port where convoys delivered American war supplies to Russia during World War II. </p> <p> Chief executives from four Russian oil companies -- Lukoil, Yukos, Tyumen Oil and Sibneft -- signed a memorandum of understanding today to pursue the project, which would connect with Russia's existing pipeline network. The project was first mentioned in May by Lukoil; it has oil fields not far from Murmansk that are mostly untapped. </p> <p> IN a little over a year, the United States has done a startling diplomatic about-face on Russia, moving it from second-rate-power status to vital ally, thanks mostly to one thing: oil. </p> <p> Eager to develop sources of oil outside the Middle East, the Bush administration is pushing American oil companies to invest in Russia, and President Vladimir V. Putin has thrown his weight behind tax and regulatory changes to draw foreign investment. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan signed an agreement today calling for an accelerated effort to resolve the long-standing territorial dispute over the Kurile Islands that has left Russia and Japan technically in a state of war for six decades. </p> <p> In a meeting at the Kremlin that was overshadowed by North Korea's decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the leaders pledged to pursue deeper economic and political ties even as they try to resolve a dispute that has bedeviled governments of both countries since the Soviet Union seized the islands at the end of World War II. </p> <p> The Russians are coming, but quietly. And that is just how some of them seem to want it to be. </p> <p> A decade ago, before the financial crisis of 1998 ended the stampede of Western investors looking for a slice of post-Soviet riches, Russian executives attending the annual World Economic Forum in this Alpine resort carved out quite a reputation. They were flashy high-rollers and hard-partiers, whose tentacles spread to the heights of political and economic power. </p> <p> Russia has been quietly negotiating with North Korea to defuse tensions caused by the resumption of its nuclear programs, officials here said even as they expressed reluctance to exert the strong diplomatic or economic pressure on North Korea called for by the Bush administration. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin and other officials have adamantly called on North Korea to end any nuclear-weapons programs and reverse its decision, announced on Friday, to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. </p> <p> Kazakhstan has reached an agreement with an international consortium led by ChevronTexaco over the financing of a major oil field, ending a dispute that had embodied the clash of ambitions between foreign investors and post-Soviet oil states. </p> <p> The dispute arose in November, when the Western companies in the consortium sought to finance a $3.5 billion expansion of the Tengiz oil field in western Kazakhstan, the largest single oil development in the Caspian Sea basin, using the project's oil revenues. The Kazakhstan government protested, saying the plan would bite into its tax receipts. The consortium responded by shelving the expansion plan. </p> <p> At the presidential palace here, a confident President Nursultan Nazarbayev strode out in December to greet foreign investors. It was all smiles for the cameras as Mr. Nazarbayev sat down with the investors, most of them oil executives, to talk about recent business developments in this vast country, rich in energy resources. </p> <p> But behind the facade of friendliness, tensions could not be hidden. A consortium had recently halted a long-planned $3.5 billion expansion at the largest oil development project in Kazakhstan, in a standoff with the government over the terms of the contract. </p> <p> The floor-to-ceiling display is usually covered with blinking lights, representing the steady flow of crude oil out of the long pipeline from Siberia, into holding tanks and eventually onto the big tankers that call at this Baltic Sea port. </p> <p> But the lights have gone out on part of the display on the wall of the oil terminal control room. Nothing is coming through the pipeline. What little oil has been reaching Ventspils from Russia in recent weeks has come by rail, at much greater cost. </p> <p> Crude oil prices dipped today, after officials of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said they would raise output targets and after the energy ministers of the world's two largest oil exporters -- Russia and Saudi Arabia -- indicated they wanted to bring down soaring prices. </p> <p> In New York trading, the benchmark price, West Texas intermediate grade oil for February delivery, fell 98 cents a barrel, to $32.10. Similar drops in price of about 3 percent occurred in other crude oil indexes. </p> <p> While in North Korea years ago, I barged into as many private homes as possible, and every single one had The Speaker. </p> <p> The Speaker is like a radio, but permanently on and without a choice of stations. It's the electronic umbilical cord from the Great Leader, waking citizens up each morning and putting them to bed each evening with a mix of heroic songs, denunciations of ''the American war-maniacs'' and tributes to Kim Jong Il, ''the greatest of great men produced by heaven.'' </p> <p> A debate is raging in Russia over how to get the bountiful supplies of crude oil out of the wilds of Siberia into world markets. </p> <p> Russia's oil exports have rapidly become the centerpiece of its relations with the world. As its production rises, its means of exporting oil are reaching capacity. Russia has reached the point where it needs to build several major pipelines, ports and storage terminals to relieve the bottleneck. </p> <p> Russia may be bumping up against a ceiling on its ability to export more oil. One big producer is already experiencing pipeline bottlenecks, and a senior executive of another warned today that the country would face a serious problem by autumn. </p> <p> As Russia steps up its oil production and takes more market share from producers in the Middle East, its means of exporting oil -- ports, pipelines and rail lines -- are running at or near capacity. </p> <p> The Bush administration is developing plans for sanctions against North Korea, that would include halting its weapons shipments and cutting off money sent there by Koreans living in Japan, in the event that North Korea continues its march toward developing nuclear weapons, senior administration officials say. </p> <p> The officials said late last week the administration had no plans to push for the sanctions soon, since the United States' Pacific allies still oppose the idea and the United Nations Security Council is likely to remain focused on Iraq for weeks. </p> <p> Rescue workers searched today through fog and storm in the mountains of Kerman Province in southeastern Iran where a military aircraft crashed on Wednesday evening, killing 302 soldiers and crew members. </p> <p> About 600 experienced mountain climbers, members of the Revolutionary Guards and relief workers were enlisted early today to try to retrieve remains of victims and wreckage from the aircraft. The passengers were members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, a branch of the army responsible for defending the revolution and for safeguarding border areas. </p> <p> With crude prices edging toward $40 a barrel and a shortfall looming in world production, South America's two main oil producers, Petrobras of Brazil and the Spanish-owned Repsol YPF of Argentina, might be forgiven for spotting a silver lining among the clouds of war gathering over Iraq. </p> <p> Remote from the potential combat zone and convenient to the United States, both companies could find ready buyers for stepped-up oil exports and give the economies of their home countries a welcome injection of fresh petrodollars. </p> <p> Along a snow-swept highway, an oil pipeline with a capacity of one million barrels a day is running at a relative trickle. The pipeline comes to an abrupt end at a giant refinery in Angarsk, a short distance from this Siberian city 150 miles from the Mongolian border. That is as far east as the Russian crude oil pipeline system goes. </p> <p> But there are vast energy-hungry markets further east, and Russia's government and its oil industry have been wrangling for months over two competing visions of how to reach them -- with a relatively short pipeline to China's industrial northeast, or a much larger and longer line to the port of Nakhodka on the Sea of Japan, where oil could be shipped to Japan, South Korea, or perhaps even California. The issue touched off debates about private property rights and Russia's geopolitical future. </p> <p> With a pen stroke at 9:45 Tuesday morning, BP agreed to make the single largest foreign direct investment in Russia's post-Soviet history. BP's $6.75 billion commitment to create a giant new oil company here left businesspeople asking whether Russia, after a decade of zigzagging economic policies, had finally become safe, fertile ground for foreign investors. </p> <p> That it was BP taking the plunge was seen as an especially encouraging sign, since the company's earlier ventures here were so fraught with problems and frustrations that they scared off some other foreigners. </p> <p> The Agriculture Ministry revoked all import licenses for meat and poultry today without warning or explanation. </p> <p> The decision will effectively halt all shipments of meat and poultry from abroad starting next week, Russian news agencies reported. Importers will have to reapply for the permits, known as veterinary licenses -- a process that could take weeks, given Russia's tangled bureaucracy. </p> <p> BP, the world's third-largest oil company, agreed today to pay $6.75 billion to form a new Russian oil company. The deal underscores the growing attractiveness of Russia to foreign oil concerns and could increase the country's already significant role as an exporter of crude oil. </p> <p> Under the deal, which is the largest single investment in post-Soviet Russia, BP will merge its assets in the Russian oil company Sidanco with those of several Russian businessmen who own two other Russian oil producers. The resulting company would become Russia's third-largest oil producer. BP will pay cash and equity for a 50 percent stake in the new company. </p> <p> Boots crunching on the packed snow of Siberia's largest car lot, Anatoly M. Kiselev passed row upon row of the cars that keep the Russian Far East rolling: Toyota Land Cruisers, Mitsubishi Pajeros, a delivery van from Osaka, and strings of sensible Hondas and Nissans, many still bearing stickers from parking garages in Tokyo. </p> <p> Incomprehensible Japanese characters emblazoned on a Toyota pickup truck? No problem. Left-hand drive in right-hand-drive Russia? No problem. Everything sells. </p> <p> The Russian government has proposed restrictions on tax-rate and regulatory guarantees used to attract foreign investment to its oil industry. </p> <p> The proposal, a product of a meeting yesterday between Prime Minister Mikhail M. Kasyanov and domestic oil executives, called for the government to offer guarantees of future tax rates and regulatory treatment only to the largest and most capital-intensive development projects. </p> <p> While many countries are beginning to feel the pinch of high oil prices, Russia, the world's No. 2 oil producer, is suffering from a very different problem -- too much money. </p> <p> Russia's economy is awash in oil dollars. The combination of rising proceeds from exports and the heavy borrowing that Russian oil companies have done abroad has cash flowing into the country faster than the economy can absorb it. The central bank's currency reserves have risen by $4.8 billion, or more than 10 percent, since mid-January. </p> <p> The White House said today that Russian companies were supplying Iraq with sophisticated military equipment for use against the United States and that President Bush had pressed President Vladimir V. Putin during a phone call this morning to crack down on them immediately. </p> <p> Administration officials said the United States had been pressuring Russia for almost a year to end what American intelligence has identified as sales of three types of equipment to Iraq: night vision goggles, antitank guided missiles and devices that can jam satellite-based navigation systems used to guide weapons to their targets. </p> <p> Iraq today resumed destroying its short-range Al Samoud 2 missiles and, apparently in a further attempt to exploit the deep divisions among the world's powers over war, issued a defiant list of demands to the United Nations. </p> <p> Glossing over the negative aspects of the latest report by the weapons inspectors, a government statement issued from a meeting presided over by Saddam Hussein and editorials in the government-controlled press all reached the same conclusion: that Iraq had been declared sufficiently free of weapons of mass destruction to warrant the cancellation of sanctions imposed after the 1991 Persian Gulf war. </p> <p> France has embarked on a two-track strategy to adjust to the harsh reality that it will have to pay a steep price for opposing the war against Iraq, French officials and analysts say. </p> <p> The severity of the long-term damage to relations with the United States is only beginning to be grasped. Senior French officials visiting Washington on non-Iraq issues in recent weeks said they were stunned when their American counterparts informed them of official ''resentment and anger'' against France, one official said. A French official was told bluntly by a White House official, ''I have instructions to tell you that our relations have been degraded.'' </p> <p> Having declared Saddam Hussein's rule to be ended, President Bush called on the United Nations today to lift economic sanctions on Iraq, moving to allow greater sales of Iraqi oil to help pay for its reconstruction. </p> <p> In a speech here that combined elements of a campaign appearance with a solemn remembrance of lives lost in Iraq and a restatement of his foreign policy principles, Mr. Bush said that ''the regime of Saddam Hussein has passed into history'' and that it was time to end more than 12 years of sanctions, which have all but halted international trade with Iraq. </p> <p> The Bush administration plans to ask the United Nations to lift international penalties against Iraq in phases, retaining United Nations supervision of Iraq's oil sales for now but transferring other parts of its economy to a new Iraqi authority in coming months, administration officials said today. </p> <p> The officials said that instead of a single Security Council resolution to lift sanctions on Iraq, the United States would seek three or four resolutions over several months, gradually turning over parts of the economy to an Iraqi authority assembled with American guidance. </p> <p> Why do you suppose France and Russia  nations that for years urged the lifting of sanctions on oil production of Saddam's Iraq -- are now preventing an end to those U.N. sanctions on free Iraq? </p> <p> Answer: the Chirac-Putin bedfellowship wants to maintain control of the U.N.'s oil-for-food program, under which Iraq was permitted to sell oil and ostensibly use the proceeds to buy food and medicine for its people. (In reality, Saddam skimmed a huge bundle and socked it away in Swiss, French and Asian banks.) </p> <p> With the profits from high oil prices lifting Russia up to stardom among emerging markets, Russian companies are hurrying to capitalize by tapping the international markets for financing. </p> <p> A year ago, only a handful of Russian borrowers had rebuilt enough credibility after the financial crisis and debt defaults of 1998 to have a hope of issuing debt abroad on a large scale. Now, many more companies are in on the act. </p> <p> Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and President Vladimir V. Putin talked here for two hours today about postwar Iraq, but the session ended with Mr. Putin seemingly still far from London and Washington on the crucial question of the United Nations' role in rebuilding the country. </p> <p> At a sometimes terse news conference after the meeting, Mr. Putin repeated his earlier insistence that United Nations sanctions against Iraq could not be lifted until the country had been certified free of unconventional weapons. Only United Nations weapons inspectors could reliably certify that, he added. </p> <p> Crocus City, a complex of 200 luxury stores rising in a northwest suburb here, is so immense that patrons get around in electric carts. </p> <p> There is lots to get around to: for starters, a stable of European designer salons, a Ferrari dealer, a wine museum, a tropical forest, waterfalls, a hotel and exhibition hall, a water ballet and -- for passing yachts -- a private Moscow River pier and beach. </p> <p> In a deal regarded as a coming of age for Russian capitalism, two oil companies here announced today that they would merge to create the world's fifth-largest publicly traded oil company. </p> <p> Russia's largest oil producer, the Yukos Oil Company, will pay $13 billion in cash and stock to buy Sibneft, the No. 5 Russian oil company. Yukos's principal owner, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, will manage the new company, to be called YukosSibneft. Sibneft's principal owners, including the entrepreneur Roman Abramovich, will hold about 29 percent of the new company. </p> <p> Jacques Chirac's scheme to win French companies fat contracts in reconstructing Iraq has run into realpolitik: anti-U.S. actions have consequences. </p> <p> After a decade of opposing any pressure on Saddam to obey U.N. resolutions, France reversed itself after its favorite dictator was brought down. Chirac and his new ally, Vladimir Putin, let it be known they would refuse to lift U.N. sanctions on the sale of Iraqi oil. </p> <p> Corruption and racketeering may have built some of Russia's post-Communist business empires, but that does not necessarily make them accountable under the American Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, as some lawyers and investors have hoped. </p> <p> Late Friday, a Federal court in New York threw out a $3 billion civil suit filed under the RICO law against Russian Aluminum, the country's biggest aluminum producer; the suit was filed by three small Russian metal-trading companies. The ruling said the dispute did not belong in an American court. </p> <p> A top Russian diplomat said today that a nuclear-armed North Korea was against Russian national interests and that the Kremlin would re-evaluate its opposition to international penalties should the North Koreans develop nuclear weapons. </p> <p> The statements, by Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Losyukov, who was the Kremlin's emissary to North Korea during a diplomatic mission in January, amounted to a warning to North Korea that patience was ebbing in one of the few nations that has offered it sympathy during a five-month nuclear crisis with the United States. </p> <p> President Bush's call to lift economic sanctions against Iraq could mean the end of the United Nations oil-for-food program, which has overseen the country's oil sales since 1996. Not only are France and Russia likely to object, but they may well support efforts by Secretary General Kofi Annan to modify the oil-for-food system, which is due to expire on May 12, and give it a large role in rebuilding the country. Whatever Mr. Annan's reasons for wanting to reincarnate the operation, before he makes his case there's something he needs to do: open the books. </p> <p> The oil-for-food program is no ordinary relief effort. Not only does it involve astronomical amounts of money, it also operates with alarming secrecy. Intended to ease the human cost of economic sanctions by letting Iraq sell oil and use the profits for staples like milk and medicine, the program has morphed into big business. Since its inception, the program has overseen more than $100 billion in contracts for oil exports and relief imports combined. </p> <p> Dropping its previous opposition, the Russian government gave a green light today to plans for a privately owned oil pipeline to Murmansk that would carry oil bound for the United States. </p> <p> Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov told his government to begin preparing a feasibility study for the $4.5 billion project, which also involves building a new loading terminal at Murmansk, a port on the Barents Sea formerly reserved largely for military use. The energy minister, Igor Yusufov, said flatly that the government would not oppose full private ownership of the pipeline, an aspect that officials had balked at just a few months ago. </p> <p> The final American concessions on the resolution to end nearly 13 years of sanctions against Iraq won the support of France, Russia and Germany today, ensuring the overwhelming approval of the measure, which is set for a vote on Thursday morning. </p> <p> The measure grants the United States and Britain an extraordinary amount of authority over Iraq's political and economic affairs until a representative, internationally recognized government is installed. The resolution would give a limited but independent role to a United Nations special representative to help the occupying powers and Iraqi groups create a new government. </p> <p> Moving away from Germany's near-total opposition to American policy on Iraq, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder said today that he wanted to reach an agreement on the Security Council resolution being pressed by Britain and the United States. </p> <p> The resolution would lift economic sanctions on Iraq and give the United States and Britain broad authority to administer the country in the aftermath of the war. </p> <p> On this desolate shore of Sakhalin Island, where sea ice blurs into treeless tundra, stands a bright blue drilling rig, 22 stories high and fresh from Louisiana. </p> <p> The rig, here since early 2003, is now the tallest structure on the island, once a Czarist penal colony, and it is the lance point of a $12 billion oil and gas development project. It is scheduled to begin drilling the first of 10 wells deep below the Sea of Okhotsk on June 11 for a consortium led by Exxon Mobil. </p> <p> David Alders's business is up a gravel road behind his white, two-story farmhouse: six air-conditioned poultry houses, each filled with 25,000 squawking chickens -- some 150,000 chickens in all, gorging on buckets of corn feed and sipping water from plastic nipples suspended in the air. </p> <p> They are healthy chickens, and they provide a comfortable living for Mr. Alders, a lanky 42-year-old with eight children whose family has farmed on the outskirts of this blistering East Texas town since the 1830's. </p> <p> The United States has begun circulating a draft resolution to lift sanctions in Iraq. </p> <p> The measure, which Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said he ''expected'' to be introduced this week, would make a few concessions to Russian and French interests but leave the major political and financial levers of the future Iraqi government in the hands of coalition forces and the interim authority being formed with their approval. </p> <p> Old photographs from czarist-era prison camps around Sakhalin Island show prisoners, gaunt and bearded, shackled with body irons so heavy they carried them in wooden wheelbarrows. </p> <p> But a century after this island started to shift from penal colony to energy colony, foreign businessmen say their freedom of movement is being limited by a new set of shackles, this time made of paper. </p> <p> The United States and Britain won an international mandate today to occupy and rebuild Iraq, as the Security Council voted to end nearly 13 years of sanctions. It was a significant diplomatic victory for the Bush administration, as France, Germany and Russia, the principal opponents of the American-led war, lined up in support of the measure. </p> <p> The resolution passed by a 14-to-0 vote this morning while the chair set aside for Syria, the lone Arab nation on the Council, remained empty. This afternoon, the Syrian chargé d'affaires, Fayssal Mekdad, said at a later Council meeting that his government would have voted for the measure had it more time to deliberate. </p> <p> BP signed a formal agreement today to invest $6.15 billion in a joint venture to produce oil and gas in Russia -- $600 million less than planned when the venture was announced in February. </p> <p> The new venture, called TNK-BP, will be the world's 10th-largest producer of oil and gas. BP is the third largest, after Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch/Shell. The venture will combine BP's existing Russian assets -- principally a stake in the Russian oil company Sidanco -- with those of Tyumen Oil; BP's partners will be the Russian investors who control Tyumen. </p> <p> With his hands full in Iraq, President Bush has now given nearly identical warnings to Iran and North Korea -- that their efforts to build nuclear weapons will ''not be tolerated'' by the United States -- even while he is pursuing very different strategies to stop them. </p> <p> While the countries are often discussed in tandem as Mr. Bush's most urgent proliferation threats, they present different challenges. Despite Mr. Bush's declaration that the United States would never abide a nuclear North Korea, American intelligence agencies say they believe the country already possesses two weapons, and for the first time it is boasting about its capacity to produce many more. It has rejected the nuclear treaties it once had signed. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin appears to be off to a strong start on his newly announced capitalist plan to double Russia's economy in a decade. </p> <p> In the first five months of this year, Russia's gross domestic product rose 7.1 percent, about double the rate of the comparable period last year. Oil and gas production, the locomotive of modern Russia's economy, is up 11.5 percent. Russia, which exports more oil than any nation except Saudi Arabia, is increasing its oil output this year for the fifth consecutive year. </p> <p> An oil and gas alliance led by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group signed a contract here today for more than $2 billion with a Russian-Japanese alliance, clearing the way for construction to start in coming weeks on Russia's first liquefied natural gas plant. </p> <p> The plant is part of a $10 billion project approved last month that will supply the Asia Pacific region with the first gas from Russia. Ground will be broken on the plant as another alliance, one led by Exxon Mobil, starts on June 11 to drill a series of oil production wells, tapping Sakhalin Island's offshore basins. </p> <p> China and Russia sought today to delay a Security Council condemnation of North Korea's nuclear arms program, a day after a top North Korean general said any sanctions or blockades initiated by the United States would be considered a ''complete breach'' of the truce that ended hostilities on the peninsula 50 years ago. </p> <p> The letter added that if the United States took such actions, the North Korean army would ''immediately take strong and merciless retaliatory measures'' and promised that ''horrible disasters'' would befall the South Korean population. </p> <p> Hoping to revive a deal blocked once before by European antitrust regulators, Alcan, a Canadian aluminum and packaging group, today offered to acquire Pechiney of France for 3.4 billion euros ($3.85 billion) in cash and stock. </p> <p> The combination would create a close rival to Alcoa for the top rank among the world's aluminum producers. It represents a rare attempt at a hostile takeover of a French company. </p> <p> While caviar might go with canapés, it does not usually go with y'all. </p> <p> But tell that to Lewis Shuckman. </p> <p> North Korea declared today that it saw no purpose in continuing nuclear talks with the five nations it met in Beijing this week and was left with no choice but to strengthen its nuclear deterrent. </p> <p> Meanwhile, American officials, responding to the threats North Korea made on Thursday to conduct a nuclear test, said that if the country exploded a nuclear device, President Bush would be forced to press for an economic quarantine, a step North Korea has said would be an act of war. </p> <p> The BP Group said today that it would buy a stake in the Russian oil company Slavneft for $1.35 billion, and would fold the operations into its new joint venture with the Tyumen Oil Company. </p> <p> The Tyumen-BP joint venture, which has been under way since February, created a company called TNK-BP, which will be Russia's largest multinational corporation and its third-largest oil company. That deal was completed today. </p> <p> The Russian government announced today that it had approved a $6.15 billion deal signed earlier this summer between BP and the Tyumen Oil Company that will create a new oil producer and the largest multinational company in Russia. </p> <p> ''We've been given regulatory approval from Russia,'' a spokesman for BP in London said. The deal is the single largest foreign investment in post-Communist Russia. </p> <p> The Bush administration announced a trade agreement with Moscow today that could increase American poultry and meat exports to Russia as well as remove some of the obstacles blocking Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization. </p> <p> Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, held a news conference today to trumpet the first piece of good trade news since the breakup this month of world trade talks in Cancún, Mexico. </p> <p> The moment was a small but sweet victory for the Russian oil baron Vagit Y. Alekperov: the Getty gas station he bought in Manhattan three years ago was renamed yesterday after his own huge oil company, Lukoil, and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was on hand to ring in the change, coffee cup in one hand and Krispy Kreme doughnut in the other. </p> <p> Mr. Alekperov wanted American consumers to understand that they need Russian oil and that companies like his are ready to provide it. For the last two years, oil has become an increasingly powerful bond between the United States, the world's largest consumer, and Russia, among the largest producers. </p> <p> The United States needs natural gas. Developing countries many thousands of miles away are willing to supply it. This sleepy beachfront town and other communities along the Gulf of Mexico are likely to become the links between producers and consumers. </p> <p> Altogether, energy companies are planning to spend more than $100 billion in the next decade to bring gas from developing countries to rich nations, according to PFC Energy, a Washington consulting firm. The only way to do it is to supercool the gas so that it condenses into a liquid, which is then compact enough to load onto tankers and send across oceans. </p> <p> Can Thierry Desmarest keep on going? </p> <p> Mr. Desmarest spent the last four years merging three oil companies while keeping production and profits growing at Total, the French oil and petrochemicals group he built. His challenge now is to match that over the next four years. </p> <p> The shock waves from last week's arrest of the Russian billionaire Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky have spread widely, but not evenly, through the club of international investors. </p> <p> Here in Germany, Russia's largest trading partner, large-scale investors said that they remained committed to the country. That is hardly surprising, given that they have poured billions of euros into energy-distribution deals, pipeline projects and even equity investments in Russian companies. </p> <p> With a 10-mile-wide sliver of Russian territory blocking Manchuria from the Sea of Japan, China is drawing on its own history for a solution, pushing Russia to sign a 49-year lease to convert the midsize cargo port on Trinity Bay here to a Chinese economic enclave, a Hong Kong of Russia's Far East. </p> <p> So far, the Russians have not agreed. But the Chinese are making their intentions plain: they have built a six-lane highway to the door of the border crossing closest to here and, according to Russian officials, ordered Chinese companies to boycott Russia's ports in the Sea of Japan until Moscow agrees to the scheme. </p> <p> Lukoil, Russia's second-biggest oil company, rode higher crude oil prices to a 38 percent increase in quarterly earnings, and said Tuesday that it planned to sell even more crude oil outside Russia and less at home to cash in on high global oil prices. </p> <p> ''Oil exports keep growing, and sales in the internal market are going down,'' Leonid Fedun, Lukoil's head of strategic planning and investment analysis, and a company vice president, said at a news conference Tuesday. ''We hope that in 2004 we will practically stop selling oil'' domestically, he added. </p> <p> Bolstered by higher oil prices, Russia's economy continued its growth streak in 2003, as the latest data showed healthy bank reserves, diminished capital flight and a growing trade surplus. </p> <p> Many economists credit the president, Vladimir V. Putin, with shepherding Russia out of economic stasis, by cutting taxes and fostering political stability in his first term. But oil remained the crucial factor underpinning Russia's economic boom, and rising oil prices, combined with Mr. Putin's policies, spurred growth of 6.1 percent on average over the last four years. In 2003, the economy grew 6.8 percent, the economic ministry said in a preliminary report this week. </p> <p> For now, Krylova Cape is not much to see: a spit of land between the Russian taiga forest and the Sea of Japan, its soil being graded a bit by a bright yellow bulldozer. But what is taking shape here is central to a pitched struggle between the two most important economies in Asia: the reigning titan, Japan, and its rising challenger, China. </p> <p> Both economies are hungry for raw materials, especially energy -- Japan because it has almost none of its own, China because its economic boom has fast outstripped what once were adequate domestic supplies. Both want to limit their dependence on oil from distant, politically volatile regions like the Middle East. And both see an attractive alternative in the little-tapped energy riches of the vast, vacant Russian Far East. </p> <p> Beluga caviar, pearly black and $1,500 a pound, goes well with Champagne. But next year, connoisseurs may have to do with farmed American caviar or lesser Caspian species if the United States Fish and Wildlife Service decides to ban imports. </p> <p> At issue is the number of beluga sturgeon in the Caspian Sea. Some researchers say the sturgeon, a 200-million-year-old species, is in serious trouble. But in September, the Geneva-based Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna, known as Cites, announced that numbers of beluga sturgeon rose to 11.6 million from 9.3 million from 2001 to 2002, 25 percent. The figures were supplied to Cites by Russia's Caspian Fisheries Research Institute in Astrakhan, once the country's caviar capital. </p> <p> A century after the Russian-Japanese war broke out, the first in a string of conflicts between these Pacific powers, the two perennial adversaries now seem to be finally embarking on an era of real economic cooperation. </p> <p> Their bilateral trade increased about 25 percent last year. For the first time, Japanese power companies took deliveries of Russian oil and committed themselves to buying Russian gas. Oil and gas investment has flowed in such volumes in the last 18 months that it has roughly doubled Japan's total foreign direct investment in Russia, to about $1 billion. </p> <p> In its final years in power, Saddam Hussein's government systematically extracted billions of dollars in kickbacks from companies doing business with Iraq, funneling most of the illicit funds through a network of foreign bank accounts in violation of United Nations sanctions. </p> <p> Millions of Iraqis were struggling to survive on rations of food and medicine. Yet the government's hidden slush funds were being fed by suppliers and oil traders from around the world who sometimes lugged suitcases full of cash to ministry offices, said Iraqi officials who supervised the skimming operation. </p> <p> Kevin Hennessey has a message for executives who complain that they spend too much time cutting through red tape in their jobs: ''Try spending a day in my shoes.'' </p> <p> Mr. Hennessey, a former senior investment banker at Credit Suisse First Boston who spent many of his 22 years at the company traveling to Russia, is co-publisher and co-editor of a new, 1,200-page book, ''Russia: All 89 Regions Trade and Investment Guide,'' published in conjunction with the Council for Trade and Economic Cooperation U.S.-Russia. The guide, which sells for $395, offers detailed information for Russia's 89 regions. </p> <p> On North Korea's desolate eastern coast, 600 miles directly across the Sea of Japan from here, soldiers guard an abandoned construction site where two light-water nuclear reactors were to be built. </p> <p> North Korea is desperately short of energy, and agreed in 1994 to halt its nuclear weapons program in exchange for help from its capitalist neighbors and the United States in building nuclear power plants. But work at the site was halted on Dec. 1 because the United States said North Korea had violated the 1994 agreement by pursuing nuclear weapons anyway. On Friday, the State Department said the civilian nuclear power program had ''no future.'' In retaliation, North Korea is holding hostage the construction equipment at the site belonging to contractors from South Korea, which has sunk almost $1 billion into the project. </p> <p> Just days after President Vladimir V. Putin publicly scolded his cabinet for not setting ambitious enough growth goals for Russia, the economics minister raised his forecasts for the economy on Thursday, citing high global oil prices. </p> <p> German Gref, the economic development and trade minister, raised his outlook for Russia's growth this year to 6.4 percent from 5.2 percent, saying he now assumed higher oil prices. With his outlook now hinged on higher oil, Mr. Gref said he also expected Russia's economy to average an annual 6.2 percent growth from 2005 to 2007. The government had expected growth of 5.8 percent in 2005. </p> <p> China plans to significantly expand its nuclear power in the coming decades, and the Bush administration has been courting the country's top officials on behalf of American companies seeking a starring role in that expansion. </p> <p> The United States is competing with France, Russia and, in a minor way, Canada to build four 1,000-megawatt plants that energy executives say will signify China's coming of age as a nuclear energy provider, and offer crucial relief to makers of nuclear technology starved of new orders in their home countries. </p> <p> With its dozen blue-roofed villas, a brand-new sauna house, casino and three-star hotel constituting the heart of what this frigid outpost at the border of Central Asia fancies as downtown, this would seem an unlikely spot for the economic and political reordering of an entire region. </p> <p> An agreement this month to build a oil pipeline through this tiny hamlet makes it the center of an explosion of economic activity in what only recently was one of the most backward corners of China. The pipeline will traverse Alashankou as it snakes its way past the snowbound mountain ranges of Central Asia, still filled with tribal horsemen driving herds of goats and camels, on its way to China's industrialized east. </p> <p> Recalling that Quebec powers New York and Paraguay powers São Paulo, Viktor N. Minakov tapped his pen on a map of Russia's Far East and spun a vision of this corrugated landscape helping power China, the 21st century's factory to the world. </p> <p> As power blackouts threaten China's industrial growth, China is increasingly looking north, much the way American power company executives first looked to Canada for power in the 1960's. Only 3 percent of hydroelectric power potential has been tapped in border areas of the Russian Far East, a mountainous region with a population density on a par with that of Maine. </p> <p> Norilsk Nickel said on Monday that it had acquired 20 percent of Gold Fields, the South African mining corporation, from Anglo-American for $1.16 billion in cash. The move, which took the industry by surprise, propels Norilsk, a large Russian metals producer little known in the West, into the top ranks of gold producers. </p> <p> ''Norilsk Nickel believes the purchase of a 20 percent stake in Gold Fields, with its world-class gold mining assets, to be an excellent investment,'' Leonid Rozhetskin, vice chairman for the management board of Norilsk Nickel, said in a written statement. ''We think particularly highly of Gold Fields' management.'' </p> <p> Backs to a biting Siberian wind, Russian welders toiled recently, their bright blue flames securing a new kind of fence on this spare landscape where Russia meets China. </p> <p> Inside the steel mesh enclosure will be a 75-acre free trade zone, where Russians and Chinese can mingle freely without visas, make purchases at a huge department store, be treated at an ''eastern medicine'' clinic, produce duty-free goods in factories and stay at a five-star hotel. </p> <p> A group of Russian engineers secretly aided Saddam Hussein's long-range ballistic missile program, providing technical assistance for prohibited Iraqi weapons projects even in the years just before the war that ousted him from power, American government officials say. </p> <p> Iraqis who were involved in the missile work told American investigators that the technicians had not been working for the Russian government, but for a private company. But any such work on Iraq's banned missiles would have violated United Nations sanctions, even as the Security Council sought to enforce them. </p> <p> Dr. Louis G. Lange, a cardiologist and the chief executive of a small biotechnology company, has a new drug that, if approved, will be the first new treatment for angina in a quarter-century. </p> <p> Like many drug companies, Dr. Lange's, CV Therapeutics of Palo Alto, Calif., tested its new product overseas, where studies go faster because it is easy to find patients who are eager to participate. </p> <p> The Bush administration is imposing sanctions on 13 foreign companies and individuals in seven countries that it says have sold equipment or expertise that Iran could use in nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs, according to administration and congressional officials. </p> <p> The sanctions will prohibit the companies and individuals from exporting goods to or receiving contracts or assistance from the United States and will prevent American companies from trading with them for two years. Officials said the sanctions were being imposed under the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000, which prevents sales of goods and technology that Iran could use to acquire long-range missiles and unconventional weapons. </p> <p> Commercial hunting of baby seals is back and even bigger than when it stirred a global outcry two decades ago. </p> <p> Horrified by the clubbing of infant harp seals, animal rights advocates swayed public opinion against the hunt. Environmentalists joined the campaign, fearing that the species was being depleted. World sales collapsed. Even Canada reacted with revulsion and began stiffening regulations on the kill. </p> <p> Russia, with the last big economy outside the World Trade Organization, won support for membership in the group from the European Union on Friday and subsequently said it would support the environmental treaty on emissions known as the Kyoto Protocol. </p> <p> Russia signed a trade deal with officials representing the 25-nation European Union, Russia's biggest trading partner. The deal, after six years of negotiations, is a political victory for President Vladimir V. Putin. Russia's last remaining major hurdle to joining the 147-trade body is an agreement with the United States. </p> <p> By rights, Russia should have a world-class energy company. It has 6 percent of the world's oil reserves and pumps 10 percent of daily global production, rivaling Saudi Arabia. And its economy has rebounded as oil-consuming nations east and west turn increasingly to Russia for energy supplies. </p> <p> The decade of sharp-elbowed deal making that shaped the Russian industry yielded two leading contenders for the global energy big leagues. One, Yukos, was a clear favorite in the capital markets: run by a charismatic, financially astute young chairman, eager to do business the Western way, emphasizing transparency and technical skill, and open to deals with giants like Exxon Mobil. </p> <p> Almost three years after the Sept. 11 attacks, America is still seeking sources of energy besides the Middle East, and Russia has plenty of oil to sell. </p> <p> But after numerous meetings and high-level talks, the once-promising United States-Russia energy dialogue is sputtering, say government officials and foreign and Russian energy companies. </p> <p> Scrambling to control high oil prices, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet this weekend in Beirut before its official conference there next week and may pursue a plan to raise quotas sharply or do away with them entirely, an OPEC spokesman said yesterday. </p> <p> Lifting quotas entirely ''could be one of the options'' that OPEC considers this weekend, Dr. Abdulrahman al-Kheraigi, an OPEC spokesman, said in a telephone interview. ''That option might be seriously considered,'' he said, ''but I haven't heard anything official. I'm not ruling out anything, for now, though. Everything will be on the table.'' </p> <p> The Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, said in his state of the nation address on Wednesday that he wanted to make the Russian ruble fully convertible by 2006, moving up the target date from 2007. </p> <p> In a wide-ranging speech that focused mainly on Russia's economy, Mr. Putin said that inflation should be reduced to about 3 percent as a prelude to allowing the ruble to float freely. Price growth in Russia is currently about 12 percent a year. </p> <p> Far below the edge of a cavernous dry dock, hundreds of workers in orange jumpsuits and hard hats labored in a forest of steel reinforcing bars, laying the gray concrete bases for two gas- and oil-producing platforms that will soon rise 20 stories. </p> <p> ''The Japanese participation is huge,'' David J. Greer, the Sakhalin Energy Investment Company project director said on Monday, shortly before Russian officials formally inaugurated the dry dock, part of a $150 million project in this port. </p> <p> In an effort to increase natural gas supplies to the United States, American officials are pursuing long-term export agreements with Russia. </p> <p> At the same time, the natural gas monopoly Gazprom, the main player in Russia, is grappling with complaints from minority shareholders that its business and profits are not transparent enough. </p> <p> President Bush has authorized a team of American negotiators to offer North Korea, in talks in Beijing on Thursday, a new but highly conditional set of incentives to give up its nuclear weapons programs the way Libya did late last year, according to senior administration officials. </p> <p> The proposal would be the first significant, detailed overture to North Korea since Mr. Bush took office three years ago. </p> <p> Fierce opposition to proposed liquefied natural gas terminals in Baja California has thrown into doubt the Mexican government's plan to end the country's dependence on United States gas imports. </p> <p> Petróleos Mexicanos, the oil monopoly, is heavily taxed to finance the government's budget and is starved for cash to develop the country's abundant natural gas reserves. So Mexico imports, at high prices, close to 20 percent of the gas it uses. All of that comes from the United States. </p> <p> Russia's largest oil producer warned on Wednesday that it might be forced to stop exporting, as the brinkmanship between the company, Yukos, and the Kremlin intensified. The warning rattled world energy markets, driving crude oil futures to the highest level in 21 years. </p> <p> Russian officials, who are seeking billions of dollars in back taxes from Yukos and may ultimately confiscate its major assets, sought to dispel worries about supplies, saying that crude oil shipments would not be disrupted. And the company continues to pump and ship oil. </p> <p> Russia lifted an order on Thursday that froze some assets of Yukos, the country's largest oil company, after Yukos warned that the freeze could shut down its oil production. </p> <p> The Justice Ministry clarified an earlier order and said the company's three oil-producing subsidiaries could continue production and sales. But Yukos's property and other fixed assets remain frozen, and the company still faces a bill for billions of dollars in back taxes that it has been unable to pay in full. </p> <p> A thousand miles away in the power corridors of Moscow, the company is on the ropes. But in the swampy oil fields of Western Siberia where it makes its living, Yukos is still a world-beater. </p> <p> None of the clanking obsolescence of the Soviet-era oil industry was in sight this week when Steven M. Theede, the American chief executive of Yukos, flew to Nizhnevartovsk, near Tomsk, to cut the ribbon on a new power plant, part of the company's relentless drive to capture as much value as it can from its immense operations. Yukos built the plant to make productive use of the methane gas that occurs naturally in its oil wells, and would otherwise have to be burnt off in huge flares. </p> <p> Two weeks ago, China's largest copper company signed a letter of intent to study investing in Mongolia's largest mining project. This week, Mongolia's president, on a state visit to Beijing, invited China to drill for oil. Next month, zinc production is to start at a new $50 million Chinese mine in eastern Mongolia. </p> <p> To link it all together, Chinese aid is paying for Chinese crews this summer to pave major roads across Mongolia's grassy steppes. More may come from a $300 million loan offered by China's president when he stopped here last year. </p> <p> A top Russian energy official came to the defense of Yukos, the country's largest oil producer, on Wednesday, urging the legal authorities to unfreeze the company's bank accounts. </p> <p> Worried that Yukos's exports might be stymied by a cash squeeze, the Federal Energy Agency asked court bailiffs to unfreeze the company's bank accounts, at least temporarily, despite its outstanding tax bill. </p> <p> Is natural gas becoming the new oil? </p> <p> At a time when the nation is chafing at its persistent dependence on foreign oil, it is becoming clear that the United States may be headed for the same situation with natural gas. </p> <p> The Russian government said Thursday that it would hold an auction Sept. 29 to sell its 7.59 percent stake in Lukoil, the giant oil company, at a starting price of $1.93 billion. </p> <p> Government officials said it would be the biggest privatization in Russian history. </p> <p> RUSSIA is again emerging as a superpower  but the reason has less to do with nuclear weapons than with oil. </p> <p> The country has its swagger back, as its economy expands for the fourth consecutive year and the world price of oil hovering at just over $45 a barrel. Now the second-largest oil producer behind Saudi Arabia, Russia has positioned itself as an important alternative supplier to the increasingly unstable Middle East. </p> <p> Crude oil prices surged to all-time highs Thursday amid conflicting signals from Russia about the embattled oil giant Yukos. </p> <p> The Russian authorities rescinded an offer made a day earlier to allow Yukos to use its frozen bank accounts to finance day-to-day operations. Renewed concerns over the loss of around 1.7 million barrels a day of Yukos production prompted a surge in oil prices. </p> <p> The Russian oil giant Yukos said Monday that its crude oil production would be 4.5 percent less than expected for 2004, the first time the company's conflict with the Russian government has had a concrete affect on the country's oil production. </p> <p> The company, Russia's No.1 oil producer, said that its continuing tax dispute with the Russian authorities had led it to cut its capital spending program, and as a result, its production estimate now stands at 86 million tons, or 627 million barrels, down from its earlier estimate of 90 million tons for this year. </p> <p> Oil prices set a record again on Thursday on concerns about production disruptions this week in Iraq and continued uncertainty about the fate of Yukos, Russia's largest oil producer. </p> <p> The crisis engulfing Yukos, which owes $3.4 billion in back taxes, did ease somewhat on Thursday after the Russian government hired an investment bank to evaluate the sale of a major Yukos subsidiary, prompting hopes that a potential asset sale could be done openly and bring a fair price. The Justice Ministry appointed Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, a unit of Dresdner Bank, part of the Allianz Group, to carry out an independent valuation of Yuganskneftegas, the company's main oil production unit. </p> <p> Russian liquefied natural gas would be shipped across the Pacific to help power California under a contract that is in ''very, very advanced'' negotiations, according to a corporate executive on Sakhalin Island, Russia's new energy production center in the Pacific. </p> <p> The gas would go to a terminal in Northern Mexico from a plant on Sakhalin that is to open in 2007, becoming Russia's first plant to chill natural gas for shipping, according to Andy Calitz, commercial director of the Sakhalin Energy Investment Company, a production consortium led by Royal Dutch/Shell. </p> <p> A top Yukos executive said on Monday that the company should be able to produce and sell oil at least until the end of September. </p> <p> ''I don't expect the company to have any problems producing, refining and selling oil until the end of September,'' the chairman of Yukos, Viktor V. Gerashchenko, told the Reuters news agency. </p> <p> The Russian oil giant Yukos said on Sunday that it would immediately reduce some of its rail exports of crude oil to China. It appears to be the first time that Yukos's ability to transport oil has been affected by its tax dispute with the government, which has frozen most of its bank accounts. </p> <p> An unnamed Yukos spokesman told Interfax, the government-controlled news agency: ''Yukos will resume its exports to China fully the moment it regains access to its accounts, frozen by the Justice Ministry. We hope that the Russian government correctly understands the great importance of Russian oil exports to the world market and will take measures to ensure uninterrupted supplies of oil to our Chinese partners.'' </p> <p> The Russian oil giant Yukos substantially increased the reserve estimates Friday for its biggest subsidiary, one currently being appraised for sale by the government. In addition, the company reiterated that Yukos itself was operating on a ''day to day basis and was still close to filing for bankruptcy.'' </p> <p> Bruce K. Misamore, the chief financial officer of Yukos, said an unaudited study of some oil deposits at its huge Yuganskneftegas subsidiary showed potential reserves nearly five times the previous estimate. </p> <p> World oil prices rose on Thursday after Russia's largest oil producer, Yukos, said a court ruling ''paralyzes'' the company's operations. </p> <p> Futures prices of crude oil jumped more than $1 on the New York Mercantile Exchange after the Yukos announcement and reports of an attack on Iraq's northern oil export pipeline renewed fears of disruptions at a time when world oil supply is very tight. On Wednesday, crude oil prices surged by nearly $2 a barrel after the United States Energy Department reported that oil inventories shank more than expected last week. The report raised the prospect of possible energy shortages in the run-up to the peak winter season. </p> <p> Yukos, the Russian oil giant, is playing a weak hand well in its battle with the Kremlin by cutting its oil shipments to China ahead of a meeting between leaders of the countries this week, analysts said on Monday. </p> <p> On Sunday, Yukos said it would cut some crude oil exports to China because, with its accounts frozen by the government, it could not finance the upfront rail cost of shipping the oil. The news pushed world oil prices back over $46 a barrel on Monday, and raised the stakes in the company's continuing standoff with the Kremlin over a $7 billion back tax bill. </p> <p> In a detailed examination of the United Nations oil-for-food program for Iraq, the top American arms inspector described in a report released Wednesday how Saddam Hussein created a web of front companies and used shadowy deals with foreign governments, corporations and officials to amass $11 billion in illicit revenue in the decade before the American-led invasion last year. </p> <p> The report by the inspector, Charles A. Duelfer, adds considerable detail to revelations of impropriety in the oil-for-food program disclosed by Congressional committees and the Government Accountability Office. Mr. Duelfer's report describes how Iraq created a global bribery network, directing lucrative oil vouchers to Russia, France, Belarus and other countries ''on a lavish and almost indiscriminate scale.'' The vouchers allowed the recipients to buy oil from Iraq and resell it at a profit, a lucrative opportunity to benefit from acting as middlemen. They were doled out by Iraq in part to build opposition to United Nations restrictions imposed on Iraq after the invasion of Kuwait. </p> <p> Billions of dollars of Iraqi oil had been sold under a United Nations program -- and food and other goods bought with the proceeds -- when Saddam Hussein decided in 2000 that he personally wanted a bigger cut of the action. Documents now suggest that at least one United States company acceded to that demand, paying surcharges that kept the oil flowing. </p> <p> The action by the Coastal Corporation, which was founded by the Texas entrepreneur and oilman Oscar S. Wyatt Jr., is detailed in a formal Iraqi government tally of secret payments made from September 2000 to December 2003, when steps were taken by American and British officials to stop the surcharges. </p> <p> The wildlife protection arm of the United Nations announced Friday that it would allow Caspian Sea countries to export caviar, though at lower levels than in 2003. </p> <p> In a statement issued during a meeting in Bangkok, the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna, or Cites, said the approval followed an agreement by the five Caspian Sea states on a new approach that gives them an economic incentive to reduce poaching, the main cause of a 90 percent decline in stocks of sturgeon over the past few decades. </p> <p> Saddam Hussein saw his life as an unfolding epic narrative, with retreats and advances, but always the same ending. He would go down in history as the glorious Arab leader, as the Saladin of his day. One thousand years from now, schoolchildren would look back and marvel at the life of The Struggler, the great leader whose life was one of incessant strife, but who restored the greatness of the Arab nation. </p> <p> They would look back and see the man who lived by his saying: ''We will never lower our heads as long as we live, even if we have to destroy everybody.'' Charles Duelfer opened his report on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction with those words. For a humiliated people, Saddam would restore pride by any means. </p> <p> Vagit Y. Alekperov, the president of Lukoil, is at ease talking about finding fossil fuels. ''I am an expert in the area of oil and gas production,'' he said in an interview in a New York hotel on Thursday. ''There's nothing else that I know how to do.'' </p> <p> Fresh from a newly announced alliance with ConocoPhillips, Mr. Alekperov is trying to transform Lukoil from a Russian oil company to an international oil giant. Along the way, he is encountering the vagaries of global markets and geopolitics. </p> <p> Congressional investigators say that France, Russia and China systematically sabotaged the former United Nations oil-for-food program in Iraq by preventing the United States and Britain from investigating whether Saddam Hussein was diverting billions of dollars. </p> <p> In a briefing paper given yesterday to members of the House subcommittee investigating the program, the investigators said their review of the minutes of a United Nations Security Council subcommittee meeting showed that the three nations ''continually refused to support the U.S. and U.K. efforts to maintain the integrity'' of the program. </p> <p> Enriched with billions of dollars raised by exploiting the United Nations' oil-for-food program, Saddam Hussein spent heavily on arms imports starting in 1999, finding six governments and private companies from a dozen other nations that were willing to ignore sanctions prohibiting arms sales, the report by the top American arms inspector for Iraq has found. </p> <p> The purchases, which included components of long-range missiles, spare parts for tanks and night-vision equipment, were not enough to allow Iraq to significantly rebuild its conventional military or create a viable chemical, biological or nuclear weapons program, according to the report by the inspector, Charles A. Duelfer, which was released Wednesday. </p> <p> Investors and market analysts are increasingly worried that the last big source of support for the American dollar -- heavy buying by foreign central banks -- is fading. </p> <p> The anxiety was on full display Friday, when the dollar abruptly slid to a record low against the euro after a report suggesting that the Chinese central bank might start to reduce its holdings in the American currency. </p> <p> The Russian oil giant Yukos said on Friday that management was putting together an emergency plan to continue running the company for a few months, even after the auction of its prize asset in December. </p> <p> Yukos executives said that a contingency plan for the next three to four months would be developed to try to head off production problems or ''social tensions'' among oil workers and other employees at its biggest subsidiary, Yuganskneftegas, and its other divisions, according to a statement the company issued on its Web site on Friday. </p> <p> In a defeat for the Bush administration, the 35-country ruling board of the International Atomic Energy Agency passed a mildly worded resolution on Monday welcoming Iran's total freeze on a sensitive part of its nuclear program. </p> <p> The resolution, passed by consensus without a vote, removes the possibility that the group will drag Iran before the United Nations Security Council for possible censure or even sanctions. </p> <p> It is about to become the world's largest energy company. And it is making plans to supply the hugely lucrative market of North America. </p> <p> But that company -- Gazprom -- is effectively controlled by the Russian government, and therein lies the rich potential and risks for investors. </p> <p> Bankruptcy proceedings for Stelco, Canada's largest steel maker, are far from over, but soaring world steel prices have ignited a bidding war for the company. </p> <p> This week, Severstal of Russia came forward with a bid as part of an effort to expand its North American operations. And at least two other companies had previously submitted proposals to infuse the company with equity. </p> <p> Off a snowy path winding through the campus of Moscow State University, the godfather of Russian outsourcing, Alexis G. Sukharev, is packing his boxes and moving to bigger offices in the city, hoping to help create what could soon be Russia's version of Silicon Valley. </p> <p> Mr. Sukharev, 58, is well known to American information technology executives. He was the first to create a commercially successful Russian outsourcing company on the eve of the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. </p> <p> At a time when China and Russia are facing far-reaching choices about their oil trade, Russia's energy minister, Viktor B. Khristenko, made a quiet trip to Beijing over the weekend, people close to the industry said Tuesday. </p> <p> The trip, which was not reported in the Chinese or Russian media, was confirmed by a Western businessman involved in China's oil business and a Russian source close to the embassy, both based in Beijing. Both requested anonymity, citing the sensitivity of their dealings. </p> <p> Stretching from Lake Baikal to the Sea of Japan, the first trans-Siberian oil pipeline is to run 2,565 miles -- more than three times the length of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. With a price tag of $15.5 billion, it looms as modern Russia's biggest infrastructure investment, President Vladimir V. Putin's answer to the Trans-Siberian Railway of the czars. </p> <p> Because China and Japan both rely on the Middle East for about 85 percent of their oil imports, both economic giants competed fiercely over what could be the world's longest and most expensive oil pipeline. Trumping China with a more generous financing offer, Japan, the world's second-largest oil importer, hopes that the four-foot diameter pipe will bind it to Russia, the world's second-largest oil exporter. </p> <p> India's prime minister warned on Sunday that China had moved ahead in securing worldwide oil and natural gas supplies, the bluntest expression yet of energy worries among Indian leaders. In the last two weeks, they have pursued a series of energy deals that have surprised global markets. </p> <p> ''I find China ahead of us in planning for the future in the field of energy security,'' Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in a speech here at the convention of India's oil and gas industry. ''We can no longer be complacent and must learn to think strategically, to think ahead, and to act swiftly and decisively.'' </p> <p> China denied on Thursday that it had helped finance the purchase of a Yukos oil subsidiary by the Russian state oil company Rosneft, while Russian officials also tried to erase any link between China and the acquisition. </p> <p> Analysts said Thursday that the moves might be an attempt to avoid being sued by Yukos, which won an injunction in a bankruptcy court in Texas in December barring any company from financing a bid for the subsidiary, Yuganskneftegas. </p> <p> The Russian general gamely tried on a samurai helmet. The visiting Japanese general donned a Russian fur hat. Together, they watched Russian tanks maneuver across the snow-covered terrain. </p> <p> Japan and Russia are weaving closer military and economic relations, and the reason lies just across the Amur River from here -- China. </p> <p> China lent Russia $6 billion late last year to enable Rosneft, which is owned by the Russian government, to buy Yukos's biggest oil-producing unit, Kremlin officials said Tuesday. </p> <p> Through a complex financing chain, Chinese banks lent $6 billion to Russia via Vneshekonombank, a government-owned bank that had already credited Rosneft some of the money to pay for Yuganskneftegas, the Yukos production unit. </p> <p> To some critics, Europe's plan to lift its arms embargo on China is simply a way to make sure its weapons makers claim a slice of one of the world's largest military budgets. But much more is at stake in Europe's decision than whether it sells French fighter jets or German submarines to Beijing -- namely broader commercial ties and some genuine diplomacy. </p> <p> That, political and military analysts here say, is why European leaders appear ready to defy the United States, which opposes lifting the embargo. The conflict has bubbled up during President Bush's visit here this week, injecting a discordant note into his otherwise harmonious tour. </p> <p> India, sharing a ravenous thirst for oil, has joined China in an increasingly naked grab at oil and natural gas fields that has the world's two most populous nations bidding up energy prices and racing against each other and global energy companies. </p> <p> Energy economists in the West cannot help admiring the success of both China and India in kindling their industrialization furnaces. But they also cannot help worrying about what the effect will be on energy supplies as the 37 percent of the world's population that lives in these two countries rushes to catch up with Europe, the United States and Japan. And environmentalists worry about the effects on global warming from the two nations' plans to burn more fossil fuels. </p> <p> Midway between Okinawa and China, the Ramform Victory, a Norwegian seismic ship, is performing routine survey work, trawling with long seismic cables and using sound waves to create three-dimensional images of oil and gas deposits. But nothing is routine when Japan commissions a survey of what is hidden below the contested waters of the East China Sea. </p> <p> Chinese coast guard ships treat the surveyors as spies, radioing warnings to leave and shadowing the ship for days on end. On one occasion, the Chinese ships nearly collided with the vessel. Japan's trade minister, flying in a Japan coast guard plane, conducted an ostentatious survey, circling over the bright yellow gas production platform that China is building a mile west of waters claimed by Japan. </p> <p> THE next big thing in investing is what the strategists and economists at brokerage houses have taken to calling the BRIC's -- Brazil, Russia, India and China. These developing countries sport high growth rates, and produce and consume prodigious quantities of commodities, from oil to soybeans. </p> <p> It's easy to see how their rapid emergence directly affects the American economy. Many discussions about the price of oil, the specter of commodity-driven inflation, and the burgeoning trade deficit begin and end with the BRIC's. </p> <p> A House committee yesterday disclosed Iraqi documents that it said provided new information on what has long been seen as a campaign by Saddam Hussein to secure international support at the Security Council in exchange for lucrative oil contracts under the United Nations oil-for-food program. </p> <p> The documents, released by the House Energy and Commerce Committee in advance of hearings planned for Monday, showed that Iraqi intelligence officials focused on French and Russian officials as part of what the Iraqi memos and letters described as a deliberate strategy to overcome sanctions and create divisions on the Security Council. </p> <p> For so many years, America's economy was so dominant on the world stage, so out front in so many key areas, that we fell into the habit of thinking we were competing largely against ourselves. If we fell behind in one area or another -- whether it was math and science skills, broadband capacity or wireless infrastructure -- we took the view that: ''Oh well, we'll fix that problem when we get to it. After all, we're just competing against ourselves.'' </p> <p> In recent years, though, with the flattening of the global playing field, it should be apparent that we are not just competing against ourselves. The opening of China, India and Russia means that young people in these countries can increasingly plug and play -- connect, collaborate and compete -- more easily and cheaply than ever before. And they are. We, alas, are still coasting along as if we have all the time in the world. </p> <p> A day after the Bush administration warned North Korea against conducting a nuclear test, South Korea said Monday that it saw no clear evidence that the North was preparing to explode a weapon. </p> <p> Officials in South Korea, which resumed bilateral talks with North Korea on Monday, said they had not changed their position toward the North, rejecting for now harsher punitive actions sought by Washington. On Sunday, Stephen J. Hadley, President Bush's national security adviser, said the United States had seen ''some evidence'' that the North Koreans were preparing for a nuclear test and warned of penalties. </p> <p> From the dusty plains of East Africa to the shores of the Caspian Sea, China is seeking to loosen the grip of the United States on world energy resources and secure the fuel it needs to keep its economy in overdrive. </p> <p> Its energy deal-making has cost tens of billions of dollars and has dominated China's foreign policymaking for the past two years. At times it has put China in direct competition with American policy goals, especially in Iran and Sudan, whose leaderships are among the least favored by the United States government. </p> <p> For centuries, this country made it easy for prospectors to mine -- from the Spaniards who plundered gold to the tin barons of the 19th century to the multinational energy companies that flocked here in the 1990's to develop Latin America's second-largest natural gas deposits. </p> <p> But like many energy-producing countries these days, Bolivia has pulled back the welcome mat. With an angry population demanding a larger share of the benefits, and some groups even calling for expropriation, the government recently raised royalties and taxes to among the highest levels in Latin America. </p> <p> North Korea agreed Monday to end its nuclear weapons program in return for security, economic and energy benefits, potentially easing tensions with the United States after a two-year standoff over the North's efforts to build atomic bombs. </p> <p> The United States, North Korea and four other nations participating in negotiations in Beijing signed a draft accord in which the North promised to abandon efforts to produce nuclear weapons and re-admit international inspectors to its nuclear facilities. </p> <p> Three years ago Hyundai Motor's sales in Russia were as modest as its cars. Who among the new class of superrich would buy a low-profile Hyundai? And who among the poor could afford one? </p> <p> With revenues from Russia's oil exports pulsing through the economy, Hyundai's fortunes have changed profoundly. </p> <p> Security Council diplomats worked out final details on Sunday on a tough resolution against Syria, an action that will forcefully step up international pressure on the country's embattled president, Bashar al-Assad, and deepen his government's struggle to ward off increasing isolation. </p> <p> Diplomats from the resolution's three co-sponsors, Britain, France and the United States, said they expected passage on Monday and did not foresee a veto from either China or Russia, the two countries most reluctant to punish Syria. </p> <p> An independent report on the United Nations' $64 billion oil-for-food program for Iraq shed light Thursday on a circle of political aides and fixers in Russia and France who the report said made company connections, paid kickbacks and reaped benefits through contracts granted by the government of Saddam Hussein. </p> <p> The report by a committee led by Paul A. Volcker, named major multinational companies as well as individuals who were involved.The committee reported that the Iraqi government developed a policy of favoring France, as well as Russia; it considered France a ''friend'' for opposing the United Nations' sanctions against Iraq. Other companies from different countries tried to reposition themselves with French connections and the help of well-placed people. </p> <p> A few years ago, Russia's finance officials could only dream of the problem Aleksei L. Kudrin described recently. </p> <p> Thanks to bountiful revenue from oil exports, the Kremlin is in a position to pay $15 billion in sovereign debt ahead of schedule next year. </p> <p> The Security Council voted unanimously on Monday to compel Syria to stop obstructing a United Nations investigation into the assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri or face unspecified ''further action.'' </p> <p> The 15-to-0 vote was a diplomatic shunning of Syria, which has found itself increasingly isolated since the publication 10 days ago of an initial report by the chief United Nations investigator in the case that identified high-ranking Syrian officials as suspects in the assassination. Among the votes was that of Algeria, the Arab representative on the Council. </p> <p> The gray skiffs come and go in the dim November light, each crew accelerating their vessel's bow through the surf as they head offshore to pull nets. </p> <p> Just up the beach, behind a wall draped with drying mesh, a crew handles its catch: 12 freshly landed osetra and sevruga sturgeon, each two to five feet long. A fisherman works the knife, unzipping the fish with swift sweeps of a blade. </p> <p> The leading countries of Europe conferred about Iran on Monday, with growing indications that they would not move later this week to refer Iran's recent actions in its nuclear program to the United Nations Security Council for possible sanctions. </p> <p> Western diplomats said it remained important to keep a consensus on Iran, not only between Europe and the United States but also with China, Russia and India, all of which have said they oppose a referral to the Security Council at this time. </p> <p> Bruce Morrow worked for three years on the shores of Lake Samotlor, a tiny dot of water in a maze of oil wells and roads covering more than a thousand square miles of icy tundra in Siberia. </p> <p> From the maps the Russians gave Mr. Morrow, he could never really know where he was, a misery for him as an oil engineer at a joint venture between BP and Russian investors. The latitude and longitude had been blotted out from his maps and the grid diverged from true north. </p> <p> Last winter, the Kremlin-backed candidate in Ukraine's contested presidential election lost to Viktor A. Yushchenko, the pro-Western leader of the Orange Revolution. </p> <p> This winter, Russia is demanding almost a fivefold increase in the price of gas supplied to Ukraine, a change widely seen as payback for Moscow's embarrassment a year ago. </p> <p> Thirty years after foreign oil companies were expelled from Kuwait, the state is close to opening its lucrative oil production business again to outsiders. </p> <p> The move, expected to be approved by Parliament next month after nearly a decade of debate and delays, means that one of the top producers in the Persian Gulf finally will lift some of the restrictions imposed on foreign operators. The decision is also eagerly anticipated in oil circles because of hopes that the proposal, which would limit foreign operation to selected fields for a 20-year period, could eventually be extended to other fields in the country and possibly elsewhere in the region. </p> <p> Four weeks after Ukraine cut a deal to import natural gas through RosUkrEnergo, a shell entity based in Switzerland, the obscure company is facing an uncomfortable amount of attention. </p> <p> After becoming one of Europe's biggest energy traders overnight with the Ukraine deal, the company promised changes to become more open about its operations. Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, owns half of the company; its other owners have not been disclosed. The plush terms the company has received in the past from Gazprom are also a matter of much speculation. </p> <p> WITH the Iranian nuclear crisis about to land in the Security Council, the events that led up to the war in Iraq point clearly to what needs to be done. </p> <p> In the decade preceding the Iraq war, Mr. Hussein was able to defy the major powers when they were divided. Exploiting his advantage as a single actor and Washington's indecision over whether it most wanted nonproliferation or regime change, Mr. Hussein consistently outmaneuvered his diplomatic opponents. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin kicked off the ''Year of Russia in China'' celebration on Tuesday by bringing an entourage of 1,000 people to Beijing -- including the executives of top Russian oil and natural gas companies. </p> <p> In keeping with China's intense interest in securing Russian energy supplies, the first deal announced was a plan for two natural gas pipelines. </p> <p> China, which for more than a century turned its back on Central Asia, has reached out to Kazakhstan, Central Asia's biggest country, for one major reason: oil. </p> <p> In 2005, the China National Petroleum Corporation bought Petrokazakhstan, a Canadian-run company that was the former Soviet Union's largest independent oil company, for $4.18 billion and spent another $700 million on a pipeline that will take the oil to the Chinese border. </p> <p> The United States and Europe said Friday that they would impose sanctions against President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus and other top officials for cracking down on a peaceful protest over his re-election, which was widely seen as a sham. </p> <p> The swift and nearly unanimous condemnations from Western nations widened their rift with Belarus and posed new challenges for their relations with Russia, which has stood behind Mr. Lukashenko. </p> <p> Iran and the United States have begun to reveal new strategies in their nuclear dispute that seem bound to escalate their confrontation, as both nations seek to turn to their advantage a highly critical report that portrays a nuclear program proceeding at full tilt, in growing secrecy. </p> <p> In many ways, what has unfolded in the past three days resembles cold-war deception and brinkmanship, with some decidedly new twists for a very different nuclear age. As in the early days of the cold war, both sides have tried to write the rules on the fly, using every tool available -- from American threats of sanctions to Iranian threats to cut off oil. </p> <p> Russia's economic growth is masking signs of trouble that are characteristic of a petroleum-based economy, according to a World Bank report released Monday. </p> <p> The report, though generally upbeat, reinforced warnings that Russia is relying too heavily on oil exports while allowing its manufacturing sector to wither. The country is the world's second-largest oil producer, after Saudi Arabia. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin said Wednesday that Russia should direct future oil and natural gas exports to Asia because ''unprincipled competition'' had blocked its energy companies from expanding elsewhere. </p> <p> With the bold warning that Russia has other export options, Mr. Putin waded into a debate in Europe over the plans of Gazprom, the natural gas monopoly, which is trying to enter the retail gas market. </p> <p> The wines and spirits section of the Azbuka Vkusa supermarket, one of Moscow's largest, has an utterly new look. </p> <p> Until last week there was a robust selection of wines from Georgia and Moldova, long the most popular in the former Soviet world. Now, on shelves once crowded with dry Tsinandalis and sweet muscats, stand hastily relocated wines from Italy, Bulgaria, Ukraine and France. </p> <p> The Bush administration called Friday for Russia and Europe to penalize Iran over its suspected nuclear arms program if no agreement on sanctions can be reached soon at the United Nations Security Council. </p> <p> Seeking to press Iran at a time when prospects for Security Council action appear doubtful, R. Nicholas Burns, under secretary of state for political affairs, said individual countries should work together ''for the purpose of isolating the Iranians diplomatically and economically'' if the Council cannot act in a ''reasonable'' time period. </p> <p> Dry young Saperavi, a wine so tannic that Georgian winemakers often call it not red but black, can be one of the great pleasures of the former Soviet world. </p> <p> It is a wine with origins reaching back thousands of years, and whose rich and varied flavors have been newly coaxed by a generation of post-Soviet winemakers who are reviving the Caucasus' ancient culture of grapes and wines. </p> <p> The global suspension of the export of caviar and sturgeon products has been extended indefinitely from almost all of the Caspian Sea, the world's main caviar-producing region, meaning the supply of the delicacy will probably further tighten in the West. </p> <p> Under the decision, by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, or Cites, Iran will be allowed to export a limited amount of one species, the Persian sturgeon. But the other Caspian nations, including Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan, will not be granted an annual export quota, effectively blocking legal shipments of the prized eggs to customers abroad. Export quotas for nations that harvest fish from stocks in the Black Sea, a less significant area for sturgeon production, were set at a very low level. </p> <p> With great effort and cost, a Russian drilling crew shipped a rig into an Arctic swamp far north of Moscow. They drilled for weeks through rock -- only to find more rock. After drilling eight dry holes in 2002, the crew gave up. </p> <p> Going against the oilman's motto that the only geologist one can trust is ''Mr. Drill,'' a team of real geologists returned to the problem the next year. This time, equipped with 3-D imaging computers, they placed the rig with pinpoint accuracy over the Val Gamburtseva deposit. It is now producing volumes of oil. </p> <p> A day after chastising Moscow for its use of oil and natural gas as ''tools for intimidation and blackmail,'' Vice President Dick Cheney visited Kazakhstan on Friday to promote export routes that bypass Russia and directly supply the West. </p> <p> With his comments, Mr. Cheney waded into a messy geopolitical struggle for energy and influence in the countries of the former Soviet Union, rapidly becoming one of the world's largest-producing regions. </p> <p> The United States and Europe are divided over the latest phase of their negotiating strategy on Iran, with the Bush administration resisting a new European offer that includes a proposal for a Middle East security ''framework'' for Iran if it gives up its nuclear activities, diplomats from each side said Friday. </p> <p> The diplomats said the administration was also resisting the idea of protecting European companies from punishment by the United States for violating its sanctions if they did business with Iran, as called for in the European proposal. </p> <p> In this small bayside town on the Barents Sea, far to the north of Moscow, Russia is finally realizing an ambition to build a world-class oil port in the Arctic. </p> <p> But first, authorities had to nudge aside an earlier tenant: a strategic nuclear submarine base. </p> <p> The world economy is growing at a healthy pace but could be derailed by the United States' huge trade deficit or the ill effects of high energy prices, according to a statement issued Saturday by finance ministers from the Group of Eight wealthy industrial nations. </p> <p> They met in St. Petersburg after a week of stock market sell-offs in which the Dow Jones industrial average plunged to its lowest point in a year amid fears of inflation and higher interest rates. It came as no surprise that the ministers tempered their upbeat assessment with language suggesting a wobbly foundation. </p> <p> After 27 years in which the United States has refused substantive talks with Iran, President Bush reversed course on Wednesday because it was made clear to him -- by his allies, by the Russians, by the Chinese, and eventually by some of his advisers -- that he no longer had a choice. </p> <p> During the past month, according to European officials and some current and former members of the Bush administration, it became obvious to Mr. Bush that he could not hope to hold together a fractious coalition of nations to enforce sanctions -- or consider military strikes on Iranian nuclear sites -- unless he first showed a willingness to engage Iran's leadership directly over its nuclear program and exhaust every nonmilitary option. </p> <p> Joseph Stalin, whose name was derived from the Russian word for steel, seemed fascinated with the metal and threw resources at its production during the rapid industrialization of the Soviet Union. </p> <p> These days, Russia has more steel than it knows what to do with. With cheap labor, energy and iron ore, the huge Soviet metallurgical plants, once looked on as wasteful dinosaurs, have become takeover targets. </p> <p> On a Tuesday afternoon two months ago, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice sat down to a small lunch in President Bush's private dining room behind the Oval Office and delivered grim news to her boss: Their coalition against Iran was at risk of falling apart. </p> <p> A meeting she had attended in Berlin days earlier with European foreign ministers had been a disaster, she reported, according to participants in the discussion. Iran was neatly exploiting divisions among the Europeans and Russia, and speeding ahead with its enrichment of uranium. The president grimaced, one aide recalled, interpreting the look as one of exasperation ''that said, 'O.K., team, what's the answer?' '' </p> <p> THE Group of 7 is supposed to be made up of the world's major industrial nations. But things can change. Maybe they ought to be called the Group of 7 postindustrial countries. </p> <p> As the accompanying chart shows, the G-7 as a group has been running a collective trade deficit since 1997, and it has grown rapidly in recent years -- largely but not solely because of the declining trade performance of the United States. </p> <p> A joint venture of BP in Russia announced on Tuesday that it would sell several oil fields to Sinopec of China, the first direct sale of Russian oil assets to a Chinese company. </p> <p> Within hours of the announcement, Rosneft, the Russian state-controlled energy company, said it would exercise an option to buy 51 percent of Sinopec's newly acquired assets, leaving the Chinese with a minority stake. </p> <p> Iran on Tuesday welcomed an array of international incentives aimed at persuading the country to freeze crucial nuclear activities, but stressed that there were issues that needed to be resolved before any agreement could be reached. </p> <p> ''We had constructive talks,'' Ali Larijani, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, told state television after meeting with Javier Solana, the European Union foreign policy chief. ''The proposals contain positive steps and also some ambiguities which should be removed.'' </p> <p> Russia's finance minister, Aleksei L. Kudrin, answered critics of his country's energy policies on Tuesday, saying the government was considering opening the pipelines of the state-owned Gazprom to competition and would encourage greater investment in oil production. </p> <p> Mr. Kudrin made the statement as Russia prepared to play host at a meeting of leaders of the Group of 8 industrial nations in July. The issue is an important one to the Europeans because a choice of Russian suppliers would break Gazprom's monopoly and could lower prices in Europe. </p> <p> Russia and China, crossing a diplomatic threshold in the effort to curb Tehran's nuclear ambitions, joined the United States and Europe on Wednesday by agreeing to seek a United Nations Security Council resolution ordering Iran to freeze some nuclear activities, or face sanctions. </p> <p> The movement toward a resolution represented increased anger over Iran's refusal to respond to an offer of economic and energy incentives if it suspended its uranium enrichment. </p> <p> Two European Union officials unexpectedly floated the idea on Monday of opening talks with Moscow on forming a free trade area encompassing Europe and Russia and expressed the hope that member countries would approve of the idea. </p> <p> A European Union spokesman, however, later backpedaled on the comments, which were made by the group's president and commissioner, saying a free trade deal with Moscow is a more distant prospect, though one that cannot be ruled out as Russia's economy improves on the back of high energy prices. </p> <p> Russia and the United States are racing to reach a deal this week that would allow Moscow into the World Trade Organization, officials from both countries said on Tuesday. </p> <p> Russia is by far the world's largest economy still outside the W.T.O., a 149-nation group that sets the ground rules for global trade and investment. The United States has withheld its approval for letting the Russians into the organization, even after other countries signed off on membership. </p> <p> ROUSTAM TARIKO, a Russian multimillionaire and the president of the Russian Standard Company, knows how to antagonize his competitors in the vodka market: imply they are not Russian. </p> <p> His company's Imperia Vodka is distilled and bottled in Russia, a fact that is the centerpiece of the vodka's first advertising campaign in the United States. The campaign's slogan, ''Vodka is Russian,'' is a veiled jab at vodkas like Stolichnaya, which is distilled in Russia but bottled in -- gasp -- Latvia. </p> <p> Russia's Parliament passed a law on Wednesday that grants exclusive rights for exporting natural gas to Gazprom, the state-owned energy operator that is already the world's largest gas company. </p> <p> To take effect, the law must be signed by President Vladimir V. Putin, who has not commented on the legislation. </p> <p> The five permanent members of the Security Council reached agreement Friday on a resolution demanding that Iran suspend nuclear enrichment and reprocessing work by the end of August or face the possibility of sanctions. </p> <p> The resolution, which is expected to go to a vote in the 15-member Council next week, requests ''full and sustained suspension'' of nuclear activities by Aug. 31 and calls on all countries to prevent the shipment to Iran of any materials that could be used in its enrichment-related activities or ballistic missile programs. </p> <p> President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin announced that they had failed to come to an agreement on Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization, and aides said the deal, which had been expected as early as this weekend, was not likely for months. </p> <p> At a news conference that offered a somewhat rocky prelude to the annual summit meeting of the Group of 8 economic powers, Mr. Putin and Mr. Bush also differed over Iraq, the state of Russia's democracy and Israel's military campaign in Lebanon. </p> <p> Motorola's strange odyssey through the Russian legal system took a new twist on Thursday and, for the company, a positive one. The authorities returned 117,519 mobile phones worth $15 million that had been seized at a Moscow airport five months ago in a case that became a symbol of Russia's capricious and, many believe, corrupt bureaucracy. </p> <p> The Interior Ministry seized more than 167,000 phones from Motorola in March, although they had been approved for sale in Russia, and then provided a series of shifting reasons, saying first that the phones were counterfeit, then contraband, then a health hazard and finally evidence in a criminal corruption case that has, evidently, since been dropped. </p> <p> Russia's defense minister said Friday that it was premature to consider punitive actions against Iran despite its refusal so far to suspend its efforts to enrich uranium as the United Nations Security Council has demanded. </p> <p> Although Russia agreed to the Security Council's resolution on July 31, Defense Minister Sergei B. Ivanov's remarks made it clear that Russia would not support taking the next step that the United States and Britain have called for: imposing sanctions against Iran or its leaders over its nuclear programs. The Council set Aug. 31 as the deadline for Iran to respond to its demand. </p> <p> The United States, in its first formal reaction after Iran's counteroffer to an incentives proposal to quit its nuclear program, said Iran's position ''falls short'' of United Nations demands. </p> <p> A State Department statement said the United States was ''consulting closely'' with members of the United Nations Security Council over its next steps. </p> <p> Ukraine's new prime minister, Viktor F. Yanukovich, has promised that his government will refrain from siphoning natural gas from Russia's export pipelines to meet Ukraine's shortfall this winter, a practice that has incensed Russian officials who characterize it as stealing. </p> <p> The assurance was the latest step by Mr. Yanukovich, a pro-Russian politician, to address some of the conflicts between Ukraine and Russia since Parliament elected him prime minister on Aug. 4. </p> <p> The United States has imposed sanctions on seven foreign companies, two of them Russian, for providing Iran with materials that could be used to make unconventional weapons or cruise or ballistic missile systems, it was announced Friday. </p> <p> The sanctions, effective July 28, will be in place for two years. During that time, American government agencies are not allowed to buy goods or services from the seven companies or provide them with assistance. The sanctions also bar the sale of some military equipment, services or technologies to the companies or their subsidiaries. </p> <p> Iran responded Tuesday to a set of incentives from Europe and the United States aimed at ending its nuclear program, but did not agree to suspend the enrichment of uranium by the end of the month, the West's primary demand. </p> <p> In its response, Iran offered ''serious talks'' over its nuclear activities but did not raise the issue of suspending enrichment by Aug. 31, the deadline established by the United Nations Security Council, Western diplomats said. </p> <p> It was always going to be tough for Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to hold together her fragile coalition of world powers trying to rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions. The Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon has made that job harder. </p> <p> While Iran's official response to the package of carrots from the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China was, at 21 pages, voluminous, the key point is that Iran's leaders did not agree to suspend enrichment of uranium, the central demand of the coalition. </p> <p> Just days before it is supposed to suspend enrichment of uranium or face the prospect of sanctions, Iran continues to project an image of defiance and confidence. Its position regarding the demand that it suspend enrichment remains a determined ''no.'' </p> <p> On Saturday, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made a provocative, if symbolic, gesture by formally inaugurating a heavy-water reactor. The Iranians say the plant would be used for peaceful power generation. But nuclear experts note that heavy-water facilities are more useful for weapons because they produce lots of plutonium -- the preferred ingredient for missile warheads. </p> <p> As the Bush administration presses the world's other major powers to speed ahead with sanctions against Iran, a fascinating puzzle of conflicting evidence, contained in the latest findings by international inspectors, is fueling the debate on whether to confront Tehran over its nuclear activities. </p> <p> Ever since the International Atomic Energy Agency issued a report last Thursday, American officials have insisted that it sealed their case. Iran, they argue, has refused the United Nations Security Council's demand that it cease enriching uranium. </p> <p> In a sharp face-off involving Russian energy policy, Japan, Britain and the European Union expressed worries on Tuesday about a dispute between the Russian government and a consortium led by Royal Dutch Shell that is developing one of the world's largest oil and natural gas deposits on Sakhalin Island. </p> <p> A day earlier, Russian regulators withdrew an environmental permit for a $20 billion oil and natural gas development, Sakhalin II, where Japan's two largest trading and engineering companies, Mitsui and Mitsubishi, are minority owners. </p> <p> Russia on Friday cast new doubt on the prospects for the Bush administration's efforts to punish Iran for refusing to suspend its nuclear program, even as European leaders expressed wariness at moving quickly to impose sanctions. </p> <p> In Moscow, officials expressed regret that an Aug. 31 deadline had passed without an agreement by Iran to halt its efforts to enrich uranium that could be used for building nuclear weapons, as American and European officials believe Iran intends to do. </p> <p> After intense talks about Iran's nuclear program, the United States and other major world powers face two unappealing choices as the United Nations General Assembly opens this week: introduce a resolution in the Security Council for sanctions against Tehran that may not be tough enough to make a difference, or delay any punitive measures, rendering their diplomacy on Iran meaningless. </p> <p> So the Bush administration, along with Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany, have quietly shifted their strategy. </p> <p> Americans and Europeans are used to buying mass produced shoes, toys and microwave ovens from China. So why not roses? </p> <p> That is the thinking behind an elaborate Chinese government effort to export cut flowers, aimed not just at developing a new business to take on the world but at redeveloping the social and economic landscape here in southwestern China. </p> <p> Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Tuesday that the United States did not intend to invade or attack North Korea, but she warned the North's leaders that they now risked sanctions ''unlike anything that they have faced before.'' </p> <p> Even China, North Korea's most important ally, said Tuesday that tough measures were in order, though its representatives said the punishments might not necessarily be the harsh ones that Washington was proposing. </p> <p> The tale of the 167,000 Motorola cellphones took another turn on Monday. </p> <p> In the first chapter seven months ago, the Interior Ministry seized the phones at a Moscow airport. The ministry said first that the phones were counterfeit, then contraband and then a health hazard. A month later, government officials, with Russian news media cameras flashing, fed thousands of the phones into a chipping machine. </p> <p> North Korea said Wednesday that it would consider sanctions a ''declaration of a war'' and vowed to carry out further nuclear tests if the United States maintained a ''hostile attitude.'' The North seems to be following a clear strategy that experts say has allowed it, a small, isolated, nearly bankrupt nation, to keep the attention of the United States for more than a decade. </p> <p> In the country's first remarks since its reported nuclear test on Monday, North Korea said it felt compelled to prove its nuclear capacity to ''protect its sovereignty and right to existence from the daily increasing danger of war'' from the United States. </p> <p> Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will urge the countries of northeast Asia to create a strict system of radiation monitoring and inspections to prevent North Korea from smuggling nuclear materials into or out of the country, a senior State Department official said Tuesday. </p> <p> But in what appears to be an effort to cajole China to enforce the new United Nations sanctions against North Korea aggressively, the United States will ask the countries to focus their efforts on conducting inspections in their own territories, including ports, and on suspicious ships, trucks and aircraft rather than every piece of cargo. </p> <p> Trade negotiators who were gathered in Geneva on Thursday approved the terms of Vietnam's admission to the World Trade Organization. But the biggest winners from its prospective entry will probably be European and other Asian businesses, not American. </p> <p> Companies around the world have been scrutinizing the rapid opening of Vietnam's markets. And this agreement, which is expected to receive final approval by the organization's 149 member countries on Nov. 7, paves the way for a long list of changes aimed at transforming the Vietnamese economy. </p> <p> The Security Council voted unanimously on Saturday to impose strict sanctions on North Korea for its reported nuclear test, overcoming objections from Russia and China by explicitly excluding the threat of military force. </p> <p> The resolution, drafted by the United States, clears the way for the toughest international action against North Korea since the end of the Korean War. Primarily, it bars the sale or transfer of material that could be used to make nuclear, biological and chemical weapons or ballistic missiles, and it bans international travel and freezes the overseas assets of people associated with the North's weapons programs. </p> <p> For more than a decade, Dmitri V. Lisitsyn waged a lonely, losing battle to protect the local salmon and gray whales from the world's large oil companies, which are turning bucolic Sakhalin Island into an industrial hub for energy in Asia. </p> <p> Now, Mr. Lisitsyn suddenly has the full support of an unlikely environmental champion: the Russian government. </p> <p> Diplomatic tensions between Russia and Georgia worsened significantly on Tuesday when Russian officials vowed to impose indefinite economic sanctions on the nation to the south. </p> <p> The Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said the suspension of transportation links and postal service -- announced Monday and effective early Tuesday -- was intended to cut what he described as illegal transfers of cash from the sizable Georgian diaspora in Russia. He said the cash was being used to finance Georgia's military buildup. </p> <p> The Berlin Wall fell almost 17 years ago. At the time, the future seemed clear: The fall of the wall would unleash an unstoppable tide of free markets and free people -- and for about 15 years it did just that. Today, though, when you stand where the Berlin Wall once stood and look east, you see a countertide coming your way. It is a black tide of petro-authoritarianism emanating from Russia, and it is blunting the Berlin Wall tide of free markets and free people. </p> <p> Why? Russia is a classic example of what I like to call ''the First Law of Petropolitics,'' which posits that the price of oil and the pace of freedom operate in an inverse relationship in petrolist states -- states with weak institutions and a high dependence on oil for their G.D.P. As the price of oil goes down, the pace of freedom goes up. The day the Soviet Union collapsed the price of oil was near $16 a barrel. And as the price of oil goes up the pace of freedom goes down. Today, Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, flush with surging oil and gas profits, is crushing domestic opponents, renationalizing major energy companies, throwing out Western human rights groups and generally making himself the big man on campus in Europe. </p> <p> Gazprom, Russia's natural gas monopoly, abruptly broke off talks Monday with five international companies bidding for a stake in an offshore field in Russia, canceling the largest energy deal involving foreigners expected here this year. </p> <p> Gazprom's chief executive, Aleksei B. Miller, said his company would wrest natural gas from the challenging field without foreign help -- though energy analysts were skeptical -- and retain full ownership of a gas deposit that is one of the world's largest untapped sources of energy. </p> <p> The United States proposed tough new United Nations sanctions on North Korea on Monday after its reported test of a nuclear device, and President Bush warned the North that he considered its activity a potential threat to American national security. </p> <p> At an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council, the United States pressed for international inspections of all cargo moving into and out of North Korea to detect weapons-related material, and a ban on all trading in military goods and services with the country. </p> <p> The Russian government has never been straightforward about its plans to take control of the oil and gas business. </p> <p> So, Lithuanians were suspicious when Russia said it shut its pipeline -- the only one supplying Russian crude oil -- in late July because of a leak. </p> <p> North Korea said Sunday night that it had set off its first nuclear test, becoming the eighth country in history, and arguably the most unstable and most dangerous, to proclaim that it has joined the club of nuclear weapons states. </p> <p> The test came just two days after the country was warned by the United Nations Security Council that the action could lead to severe consequences. </p> <p> Flush with cash and eager to expand, the world's steel producers are lining up to do deals. </p> <p> The Russian steel company Severstal said on Friday that it planned to list on the London Stock Exchange to raise money for acquisitions. The announcement came a day after Tata Steel of India said it might be interested in buying the Corus Group of Britain. Last week, ThyssenKrupp said it was allocating 10 billion euros ($12.7 billion) for growth efforts, including acquisitions. </p> <p> The United States said it had won agreement on Friday from the other four permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany to seek sanctions against Iran over its refusal to shut down a nuclear enrichment program that could be used to build bombs. </p> <p> While the State Department praised the agreement, which was reached at a one-day meeting here of senior officials from the six nations, American diplomats conceded that there could still be long and difficult negotiations over what penalties to impose and their timing. </p> <p> The United States and three European allies have given Russia and China a draft text for a Security Council resolution against Iran's nuclear program. The proposal includes the extraordinary step of preventing Iranian students from studying nuclear physics at foreign universities and colleges. </p> <p> The draft resolution would also prohibit any technical or financial assistance that could benefit Iran's nuclear program, and would impose a visa ban on any Iranians involved in nuclear activities, according to European diplomats involved in the negotiations. </p> <p> The United States pressed for a Saturday vote on a Security Council resolution that would impose sanctions on North Korea for its reported nuclear test, but questions from China and Russia on Friday evening cast the timing and possibly the content of the document into doubt. </p> <p> The terms of the resolution had already been softened three times this week to meet objections from China and Russia, and earlier Friday there appeared to be agreement on holding a vote Saturday morning. </p> <p> The American push to win Security Council backing for tough, swift sanctions against North Korea appeared to be set back by China and Russia on Thursday, in an echo of the obstacles the United States faces in a similar push to punish Iran. </p> <p> The United States circulated a softened draft resolution to the Security Council in response to North Korea's assertion that it conducted a nuclear test on Monday. The United States pressed for a vote by Friday, but China and Russia immediately signaled their opposition to critical parts of the measure and said they needed more time. On Thursday night, a new draft resolution was circulated, and Reuters quoted the Chinese and Russian ambassadors calling the revisions improvements. </p> <p> President Bush arrived here Thursday morning in one of Asia's most prosperous corners, opening a five-day visit that will test whether the Republican defeat last week diminished his influence as he presses other nations to confront Iran and North Korea. </p> <p> Stopping Wednesday in Moscow for refueling, Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura, had a 90-minute visit with President Vladimir V. Putin, which the White House described as largely social. </p> <p> A meeting of six nations working on a resolution to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions broke up Tuesday evening with the ambassadors reporting widening disagreements and lessening prospects of a swift accord. </p> <p> ''The mood is not right for serious discussions,'' said Wang Guangya, the ambassador of China, emerging from the meeting of the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany, whose envoys had gathered at the French Mission. </p> <p> Officials in Washington and Moscow reached an agreement in principle for Russia to join the World Trade Organization, crossing the final big hurdle in the stop-and-go cycle that has marked the process since Moscow began its application shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union. </p> <p> The deal is expected to be signed next Saturday, when both President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia will be in Hanoi for an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting, negotiators from both countries said. The White House also announced this week that President Bush planned to stop in Moscow on Nov. 15 on his way to Vietnam. </p> <p> Russia on Friday submitted a broad revision of a draft resolution designed to curb Iran's nuclear program, and the United States promised counterproposals, casting talks on the subject into increasing doubt and delay. </p> <p> An hourlong meeting of ambassadors from the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany ended with no discussion of specifics, and a decision to circulate the amended drafts among the six governments, said John R. Bolton, the American ambassador. </p> <p> In the balmy waters of the Bay of Bengal, just off the coast, an Asian energy rush is on. Huge pockets of natural gas have been found. China and India are jostling to sign deals. Plans are afoot to spend billions on new ports and pipelines. </p> <p> Yet onshore, in towns like this one, not a light is to be seen -- not a street lamp, not a glow in a window -- as women crouch by the roadside at dawn, sorting by candlelight the vegetables they will sell for two cents a bunch at the morning market. </p> <p> BUSINESS TRAVEL 2007 -- More than two-thirds of companies surveyed said they expected their business travelers to take more trips in 2007 than this year, according to the annual business travel overview by the National Business Travel Association. And three-quarters of the companies surveyed anticipate higher spending on air travel. The survey also found a sharp jump, to 56 percent, in the number of companies that augmented use of commercial air travel in 2006 with corporate jets (including fractional-share jets) and charter flights. That compares with 33 percent who said so in 2004. (The question was not asked in 2005.) </p> <p> THANKSGIVING TRAVEL -- Airport security lines have already begun to grow as the Thanksgiving holiday travel season begins. The Air Transport Association predicts that 25 million passengers will fly on United States airlines over the holiday period, which began last Friday and ends next Tuesday. That is a 3 percent increase over last year. Next Sunday and Monday are expected to be the busiest days. ''It is critical that passengers understand what to expect, especially given new security measures,'' said James C. May, the president of the transport association, an airline trade group. Many passengers who do not travel frequently are creating delays because they are unfamiliar with new rules on carrying liquids, gels and items like toothpaste on board a plane. The Transportation Security Administration's Web site, www.tsa.gov, has details. </p> <p> RENTAL CAR SATISFACTION -- Many people may complain about rental cars, but it turns out that travelers renting cars at airports are reporting higher levels of satisfaction this year over last year, according to the J. D. Power & Associates 2006 Rental Car Satisfaction study. J. D. Power said its study found an increase in overall satisfaction in six areas: costs and fees, the pickup process, the car itself, the return process, reservations and shuttle bus or van transport. Of the major rental car companies, Enterprise ranked first in overall satisfaction, followed by Hertz, National, Avis, Alamo, Budget, Thrifty and Dollar. </p> <p> BUSINESS JETS INTERNATIONAL -- Though the market in North America will still account for 60 percent of new sales of business jets over the next few years, a new factor is pushing growth in the industry -- increasing demand overseas, especially in Europe, where longstanding opposition to private jets is weakening. The General Aviation Manufacturers Association cited ''strengthening sales in Europe and into Russia, China and India,'' as contributing to record sales this year. For the first nine months of 2006, a total of 629 business jets were shipped, a 23.3 percent increase over the period last year, the trade group said. Honeywell Aerospace has predicted that a record 850 new business jets will be delivered by the end of 2006, up from 737 last year. </p> <p> ECLIPSE JET STALLED -- Last month, Eclipse Aviation said it was anticipating imminent delivery of its first Eclipse 500 jet as the so-called very-light jet industry began rolling. But there has been a glitch, first reported last week by The Albuquerque Journal. Eclipse, which says it has 2,500 orders for its $1.5 million very light jet, has temporarily grounded its test jets to fix a bolt problem on wings. Vern Raburn, the Eclipse chief executive, said, ''We just misestimated as to how much time and effort it was going to take'' to get the first plane delivered. He said deliveries would begin ''well before the end of the year.'' </p> <p> JOE SHARKEY </p> <p> Polish lore has it that vodka was distilled from coal during Communist times after efforts to use chickens backfired. In Sweden, vodka was once produced from paper-mill residue. But vodka purists of today have little patience for alternative ingredients. </p> <p> ''Real vodka can only be made from grain or potatoes,'' says Rolands Gulbis, chairman of Latvijas Balzams, the largest vodka distiller in the Baltics, whose vodka-making tradition dates at the very least to 1900, when Czar Nicholas II of Russia built a vodka storage house here. ''If vodka can be made out of grapes, then we might as well call an apple an orange and rename brandy as beer.'' </p> <p> Inside the Kremlin last week, the executives of three major international companies -- Royal Dutch Shell, Mitsubishi and Mitsui -- heaped praise on the man whose government had effectively forced them to cede control of the world's largest combined oil and natural gas project. </p> <p> ''Thank you very much for your support,'' Shell's chief executive, Jeroen van der Veer, told President Vladimir V. Putin during a meeting that ended a six-month regulatory assault on the project, Sakhalin II, but only after the companies surrendered control of it to the state energy giant, Gazprom. ''This was a historic occasion.'' </p> <p> Gazprom, the Russian energy monopoly, threatened Tuesday to halt natural gas supplies to Belarus if that country did not agree to a large price increase by the first of the year. </p> <p> The strong Russian position suggests that Moscow is becoming aggressive in energy pricing even with countries that have been close allies. </p> <p> Sergey Brin, one of the founders of Google, was born in Moscow in 1973, and the first words out of his mouth were Russian. Yet neither Russian nor the Russian market has come easily to Google. </p> <p> Created in Silicon Valley by Mr. Brin and Larry Page, Google has adapted its search engine to dozens of languages, selling billions of dollars in advertising around the world. But in Russia, Google is behind the curve, trailing local Internet companies in executing searches and collecting rubles on the ads linked to those searches. </p> <p> Royal Dutch Shell offered on Monday to sell a stake in its $20 billion Sakhalin Island project to Gazprom, in a capitulation to the Kremlin's campaign to tighten control over the oil industry. Shell's chief executive, Jeroen van der Veer, made the offer after months of pressure by Russia's environmental regulators, who threatened to freeze work on Sakhalin 2 by revoking critical operating permits. </p> <p> Gazprom said in a statement Monday that it would study Shell's new offer. Analysts said a deal could come as early as the end of the month. </p> <p> After months of missed deadlines, threats and counterproposals in the effort to rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions, the fragile coalition of six world powers that has been facing down Tehran may be about to splinter. </p> <p> Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice sounded fed up Thursday with Russia's refusal to sign on to the list of United Nations Security Council sanctions the United States would like to see enacted against Iran. </p> <p> The Security Council on Saturday unanimously approved sanctions intended to curb Iran's nuclear program, capping months of negotiations over how severe and sweeping the restrictions should be. </p> <p> The resolution, prepared by Germany and the Security Council's five permanent members -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China -- bans the import and export of materials and technology used in uranium enrichment, reprocessing and ballistic missiles. </p> <p> Gazprom, the Russian natural gas monopoly, agreed on Friday to continue supplying gas to Georgia, but at double the price, the latest increase for a pro-Western nation on Russia's border. </p> <p> Aleksandr I. Medvedev, Gazprom's deputy chief executive, said three Georgian importers had agreed to buy gas at the company's asking price of $235 for 1,000 cubic meters, close to that paid by richer nations in Europe. </p> <p> The Security Council postponed voting Friday on a resolution aimed at halting Iran's nuclear program, after Russia objected that the document restricted legitimate business activities. </p> <p> After a full day of negotiations, however, the resolution's European sponsors were optimistic that the Security Council would approve a slightly altered version by the end of the day on Saturday. The altered version of the resolution is aimed at satisfying Russia's demands without weakening the measure in such a way that it would be unpalatable to the Americans and Europeans. </p> <p> The European sponsors of a resolution to take steps against Iran for its refusal to halt sensitive nuclear activities submitted a freshly revised draft to the Security Council on Wednesday evening and called for a vote on Friday. </p> <p> In a major concession to Russia, the principal dissenter during the months it has taken to settle on the language of the resolution, the final revision eases a travel ban on people involved in Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. </p> <p> The chief American negotiator at talks to address North Korea's nuclear program said Wednesday that the parties could reach a new agreement on rolling back North Korea's bomb-making effort this week, but the prospects for a meaningful breakthrough remained uncertain. </p> <p> The chief negotiator, Christopher R. Hill, told reporters that the United States, North Korea and the four other countries participating in the Chinese-sponsored talks had begun discussing details of how to carry out a 2005 draft agreement on ending North Korea's nuclear program. He said the tenor of the often tortuous discussions had improved. </p> <p> The United States and North Korea staked out tough positions as six-nation disarmament negotiations began here on Monday, two months after North Korea tested an atomic weapon. </p> <p> The senior United States negotiator, Assistant Secretary of State Christopher R. Hill, warned North Korea that it faced an extended period of sanctions if it refused to abandon its nuclear-weapons program. </p> <p> Statoil of Norway agreed on Monday to buy the oil and gas operations of a rival, Norsk Hydro, in an estimated $28 billion deal that would create the world's largest off-shore operator and a new national energy champion. </p> <p> Combining Statoil with the gas and oil operations of Norsk Hydro will create a Norwegian powerhouse that produces 1.9 million barrels a day and will be controlled by Norway's government. </p> <p> Saparmurat Niyazov, the authoritarian president of Turkmenistan, died unexpectedly early Thursday, the Turkmen government said, raising questions about succession and stability in a nation that is essential to European energy supplies. </p> <p> Mr. Niyazov, who gave himself the name Turkmenbashi, or the Head of All Turkmen, had ruled his sparsely populated nation since becoming chairman of the Turkmen Communist Party in 1985, when the country was a Soviet republic. </p> <p> In the latest twist in a worldwide tussle over digital music, several recording companies have sued the operator of a Russian online music service, hoping that the American courts can accomplish what international efforts have not. </p> <p> The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, seeks an injunction to prevent the service, AllofMP3.com, from selling copyrighted music without permission and to force the service to surrender its domain names, effectively closing it down. </p> <p> Gazprom, the Russian energy monopoly, bought control of the world's largest combined oil and natural gas development Thursday after a highly publicized campaign of pressure on its foreign operator, Royal Dutch Shell. </p> <p> Shell's sale of 50 percent plus one share followed months of accusations against the project by a Russian environmental regulator -- a problem that President Vladimir V. Putin, in announcing Gazprom's entry, said would now most likely be resolved. </p> <p> Supplies of Russian crude oil headed to European markets came to a halt overnight, officials said Monday, in the latest manifestation of rapidly deteriorating relations between Russia and Belarus. </p> <p> The head of Russia's oil pipeline monopoly accused Belarus of illegally siphoning oil beginning Saturday in an escalating dispute over duties and transit fees. Belarus's foreign ministry acknowledged the halt but denied responsibility, suggesting that the Russians had instead caused the stoppage at their common border. </p> <p> ALL the nations surrounding the Caspian Sea can resume exporting sevruga and osetra caviar, an international environmental agency ruled yesterday. The agency, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, or Cites, said the nations' efforts to monitor the depletion of endangered sturgeon had improved. </p> <p> Last year Cites banned almost all Caspian caviar exports by refusing to issue export quotas. It said that four of the countries bordering the sea had not provided enough information to determine the extent to which sturgeon stocks were being depleted by poaching, pollution, overfishing and development. </p> <p> The Bronze Soldier stands in a small park near Tallinn's lovely Old Town, staring mournfully at the snow-covered earth, helmet in hand. An inscription in Russian and Estonian says simply, ''To the fallen of the Second World War.'' It is far less conspicuous, as war monuments go, than the furor its fate has caused. </p> <p> Estonia's Parliament, led by Prime Minister Andrus Ansip, laid the legal foundation this month to dismantle the Bronze Soldier and relocate it to a military cemetery or a memorial park on the nearby Gulf of Finland. The monument, supporters said, has become a source of tension, not remembrance, which has proved to be the case. </p> <p> SOUTH AFRICA is a nation of contradictions. Crowded high-end malls, political stability and the country's designation as host of the 2010 World Cup reflect a sense of optimism and progress. And yet 16 years after the end of apartheid, this nation of 45 million continues to grapple with widespread poverty and H.I.V., which affects about 12 percent of the population. </p> <p> Signs of the nation's growing prosperity as well as its continuing challenges are evident at the gleaming Johannesburg Stock Exchange, whose bathrooms feature boxes with free condoms to stop the spread of AIDS. </p> <p> Belarus announced Wednesday that it had reached a compromise with Russia to end a dispute that had shut a Russian oil pipeline to Europe since Monday, but the Kremlin did not confirm any agreement. </p> <p> The announcement, by President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko's office, was the first sign that the dispute might be ending after two days of increasingly hostile remarks and threats. </p> <p> President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus appeared to be the last leader in the old Soviet neighborhood to realize that he was dealing with a different Russia. </p> <p> For much of last year, he dragged out negotiations on new gas and energy deals, assuming that pleas of solidarity and Slavic brotherhood -- encapsulated in a dusty treaty that a decade ago envisioned a glorious Union State of Belarus and Russia -- would avert a steep rise in prices. </p> <p> President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia arrived in Qatar on Monday to discuss trade, security and the possible formation of a natural gas cartel on the second leg of a three-day tour of the Middle East that is widely seen as an attempt to expand Russia's strategic role in the region. </p> <p> ''We seek to develop special relations between Qatar and Russia,'' Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the emir of Qatar, said shortly after Mr. Putin arrived. ''Relations at all levels have been developing vigorously over the past year and a half.'' </p> <p> Hollywood has often been a whipping boy here, but with a new Congress in session, the heads of the major movie studios converged on the capital Tuesday to pitch their industry in the unaccustomed role of good guy: boon to the trade balance, engine of economic growth, polisher of the nation's image and employer of a big, uncelebrated, middle-class work force. </p> <p> Cheered by the Democratic takeover, the industry's leadership hopes to press its agenda of fighting piracy, obtaining new tax advantages and reining in movie and television production from going abroad. </p> <p> Fractures between the United States and Europe began to appear Wednesday over whether the new Palestinian unity government was likely to receive international economic support even as the Middle East peace negotiators officially continued their wait-and-see approach. </p> <p> After the meeting here of representatives of the so-called quartet of Middle East peace negotiators -- the United States, Russia, the United Nations and the European Union -- the group released a statement that ''reaffirmed'' its support for a Palestinian government that would recognize Israel and renounce violence. </p> <p> The coalition of six world powers that has been trying to get Iran to rein in its nuclear program will begin drafting a new United Nations Security Council resolution to ratchet up the pressure again, officials said Monday after a meeting in London. </p> <p> Top officials from the United States, Britain, China, Russia, Germany and France agreed to begin working on the resolution after the International Atomic Energy Agency reported last week that Iran was expanding its efforts to enrich uranium, in continuing defiance of the United Nations. </p> <p> A Russian judge convicted a provincial school headmaster on Thursday for using pirated Microsoft software in school computers, but declined to impose any penalty, saying that Microsoft's loss was insignificant compared with its overall earnings. </p> <p> The case has been closely watched as a test of how Russia will enforce intellectual property rights as it moves closer to membership in the World Trade Organization. The verdict was broadcast on Russian state television. </p> <p> There may be only one thing dumber than getting addicted to consuming oil as a country -- and that is getting addicted to selling it. Because getting addicted to selling oil can make your country really stupid, and if the price of oil suddenly drops, it can make your people really revolutionary. That's the real story of the rise and fall of the Soviet Union -- it overdosed on oil -- and it could end up being the real story of Iran, if we're smart. </p> <p> It is hard to come to Moscow and not notice what the last five years of high oil prices have done for middle-class consumption here. Five years ago, it took me 35 minutes to drive from the Kremlin to Moscow's airport. On Monday, it took me two and half hours. There was one long traffic jam from central Moscow to the airport, because a city built for 30,000 cars, which 10 years ago had 300,000 cars, today has three million cars and a ring of new suburbs. </p> <p> Given its connotations, Pandora is an oddly inappropriate name for an uranium mine. </p> <p> But that does not seem to bother Denison Mines, the company from Vancouver, British Columbia, that owns it. Denison recently reopened this mine about 30 miles southeast of Moab, along with several others in nearby western Colorado, after it lay dormant during the years when the nation shunned nuclear power. </p> <p> Russia has informed Iran that it will withhold nuclear fuel for Iran's nearly completed Bushehr power plant unless Iran suspends its uranium enrichment as demanded by the United Nations Security Council, European, American and Iranian officials say. </p> <p> The ultimatum was delivered in Moscow last week by Igor S. Ivanov, the secretary of the Russian National Security Council, to Ali Hosseini Tash, Iran's deputy chief nuclear negotiator, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because a confidential diplomatic exchange between two governments was involved. </p> <p> The Security Council received on Thursday a draft of a new resolution to impose sanctions on Iran for its defiance of demands that it suspend its nuclear enrichment activities and return to negotiations over its nuclear program. </p> <p> The measure expands a roster from an earlier resolution that lists companies and individuals subject to an assets freeze. Among them are Bank Sepah, four groups controlled by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite military force, and seven commanders identified as ''key persons'' in the corps. </p> <p> Russia, Greece and Bulgaria signed an agreement on Thursday to build an oil pipeline bypassing the crowded Bosporus in Turkey, a long-debated project that will increase oil supplies to Europe but give Russia control over an important piece of the Continent's energy infrastructure. </p> <p> The planned 175-mile pipeline would run from Burgas in Bulgaria, on the Black Sea, to Alexandroupolis in Greece, near the Mediterranean. </p> <p> A NEW wave of foreign competitive pressure is beginning to ripple through the United States economy, from companies in emerging markets like Brazil, Russia, India and China. These companies are seeking to become world-spanning multinationals -- just as Samsung Electronics emerged from South Korea and Toyota sprang from Japan in earlier phases of globalization. </p> <p> From Brazil, Embraer has become a big supplier of regional jets in the airline industry. Other Brazilian companies, like Braskem, Embraco and Natura, are also expanding in a variety of global markets. Russian companies like Gazprom, Lukoil and Rusal are using Russia's natural resources to leap into the United States and other countries. India is producing powerhouses in technology services like Wipro, Infosys Technologies and Tata Consultancy Services and global competitors in manufacturing and pharmaceuticals. The world's largest steel company is now controlled by Lakshmi N. Mittal, an Indian living in Europe. </p> <p> Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, has made handsome profits selling natural gas to Europe. </p> <p> Now the company is positioning itself to make even more money, this time from the effluents from all that gas it sells to Europe. Gazprom announced Tuesday that it is selling carbon dioxide emissions credits that companies in the European Union need in order to burn Gazprom's fuel. </p> <p> Iran said Sunday that it was seeking international bids for building two more nuclear power plants despite international pressure over its nuclear program. </p> <p> ''Iran is launching two international tenders for the construction of two nuclear power stations of between 1,000 and 1,600 megawatts capacity in Bushehr,'' said Ahmad Fayazbakhsh, the deputy head of the nation's Atomic Energy Organization, who was quoted by the ISNA news agency. </p> <p> The Russian government continued Monday to press its strategy of securing for Gazprom, the state-owned natural gas company, a monopoly on exports to Asia. </p> <p> In doing so, it is threatening an important investment by a big British rival, BP, with methods similar to those used last fall to force Royal Dutch Shell to sell a controlling stake in another energy development in the Russian Far East, the Sakhalin II project. Gazprom was also the beneficiary in that case. </p> <p> The Russian nuclear power company Atomstroyexport has been roundly criticized for helping Iran build its nuclear program. But neither that project nor the company's mouthful of a name has hurt its business prospects. </p> <p> A former branch of the Soviet atomic energy ministry, Atomstroyexport (pronounced atom-stroy-EXPORT) has been the Kremlin's main instrument to meet rising global demand for nuclear power, now mainly from developing countries. </p> <p> Seventy years after the United States invented uranium enrichment, the sole American company in the business is struggling to survive, while nuclear power experts worry that its failure would leave the Russians dominant in the market for fuel processing. </p> <p> The company, USEC, has liquidated some of its valuable uranium inventories to stay afloat, as its income has declined because of changing market conditions. But it had also maintained a high dividend, bought back stock and spent heavily on severance payments after frequent purges in the executive suite. The company spent more than $100 million on two new technologies for enrichment before abandoning them and embarking on a third. </p>
