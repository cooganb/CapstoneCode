# Capstone Code Repo

Code Repo for Capstone Committee at Warren Wilson College

Here you will find the two models I used for my Capstone Project. 

In the RNN folder is the PyTorch model in a Jupyter Notebook and some sample data if you'd like to run a version of the RNN program.

In the LSTM folder is the Tensorflow model and data to run the RNN with LSTM features.
