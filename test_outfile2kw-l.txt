economic conditions and trends	<p>As 1991 was drawing to a close, Mariya Y. Vrublevskaya went out shopping in a faint snow for a pine tree so she and her two young granddaughters could decorate a traditional yolka to cheer up their spare New Year's celebrations.</p>,<p>What the 62-year-old retired factory worker discovered was that the trees, like everything else connected with this eerie holiday, had soared in price, costing 10 times more than last year and way beyond the means of grandmothers trying to bring up two girls on a combined pension and part-time pay of 250 rubles a month.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>The first expressions of angry protest were reported today among the battered consumers of Russia as they tried to cope with drastically rising food prices.</p>,<p>The incidents seemed more the exception than the rule thus far, as Russia and its neighbors adjusted warily but peacefully to the unpredictable situation. Price controls on most basic goods were ended last week in the hope of engendering free-market forces of supply and demand, but the effects thus far have proved uncertain at best.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Russians will wake up on Thursday with the cost of their no-frills existence suddenly far, far higher. Their reactions to that fact will determine the success or failure of what amounts to a huge and fateful gamble by President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p>,<p>The long-anticipated "price liberalization" after years of artificially low fixed prices will let manufacturers, regional authorities and retailers set the prices of consumer goods and most food products. The Government will continue to set ceilings on basic food and fuels, but even those will be three to five times higher.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Boris N. Yeltsin toured the docks and empty stores of St. Petersburg today in his campaign to maintain the patience of a people sorely tested by soaring prices and unrelenting shortages.</p>,<p>Drawing instant and divided crowds wherever he stopped, the Russian President issued the same mix of stern threats, appeals for initiative and promises of sausages to come that he had carried to Bryansk and other cities around Russia.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>As the United States and other Western nations get ready to send large amounts of aid to the former Soviet Union, people here are struggling to overcome inexperience and disorganization at both ends of the pipeline, as well as a strong temptation to divert scarce food, clothing and medicine to a hungry black market.</p>,<p>Rushing to stitch together some kind of safety net for the needy and to keep up with the foreign response to their country's growing emergency, Russian Government officials have created a Ministry for Social Protection.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>With the harsh fact of price rises sinking in across the nation, the Speaker of the Russian Parliament called today for the resignation of the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin for having enacted "uncontrolled, anarchic" economic reforms.</p>,<p>The call by the Speaker, Ruslan Khasbulatov, was quickly rejected by a spokesman for the Russian Government, which denied as well that Mr. Yeltsin might resign his second job as Prime Minister in reaction to the growing political protest over price rises. Mr. Khasbulatov is a popular politician who had made it clear lately that he was breaking away from Mr. Yeltsin.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>The line to buy a piece of the action in the People's Oil Industrial Investment Euro-Asian Corporation, with its unlikely sales office in an empty hall of the Museum of the History of Moscow, is a good measure of Russians' growing panic about the vanishing value of the ruble.</p>,<p>"Here we are taking a risk, of course," said Nikolai Khanchenkov, a 41-year-old scientific researcher, as he stood on the museum's drafty stairwell recently. He was waiting his turn to plunk down 1,000 rubles, roughly $10 at the current exchange rate, for a share in the brand-new company. "On the other hand, if we hold on to our money, we will certainly lose it," he said. "It is that simple." Snow Stays, Money Goes</p>,<p>With inflation running at an estimated annual rate of 300 percent, Russians are at a loss to know what to do with their savings. Some money is being siphoned off to pay for the recent big jump in food prices, but with faith in the future at a low point, many people now prefer to eat less and put their rubles into something more durable.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>The Bush Administration, in a policy switch aimed at more quickly assisting the economic transformation of Russia and five other former Soviet republics, urged today that they be admitted to full membership in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.</p>,<p>Membership in the fund and the World Bank for Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia -- the former republics with which the United States is initially establishing diplomatic relations -- could allow them access to billions of dollars in development loans to help make the unsettling transition from a centralized to a free-market economy.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Under attack from all sides for policies that have let prices soar, the Russian Government won reluctant approval today for the next phase of its painful economic reforms: a budget that it says is virtually deficit-free but calls for deep spending cuts and higher taxes.</p>,<p>As Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, the architect of the reforms, explained to Parliament today, a balanced budget and a tight monetary policy are necessary if Russia is to keep hyperinflation at bay and pull itself toward a market economy.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>The 47-nation conference on coordinating aid to the former Soviet Union opens at the State Department on Wednesday, with a host of tensions between the United States and its allies bubbling just beneath the surface over how best to help Russia and the other republics, officials and experts involved say.</p>,<p>At issue are both clashing egos and clashing policies. Many European officials, who were not consulted about the conference before it was announced, say they resent the leadership role being taken by the United States, which some of them argue is an effort to disguise how little Washington is actually doing. No longer feeling the need for Washington's security umbrella after the demise of the Soviet Union, the Europeans are increasingly speaking their mind.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Few bread stores anywhere are as well-equipped as the Australia Shop on Piatnitskaya Street in downtown Moscow. Automated equipment, a recent gift from Australia, mixes dough and bakes bread 18 hours a day, and as fresh loaves come out of the stainless-steel ovens, they are stacked in wire-mesh trays, waiting to be sold. But despite this abundance, anxious customers form a line half a block long outside the shop.</p>,<p>Lines like these, televised abroad, give the impression of a bread shortage in Moscow, an impression that by all accounts is erroneous. Bread sales have risen to record levels in recent months, as people substitute bread for meat, cheese, milk and eggs, all of which have grown much too expensive for many consumers.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Fearful that suppliers would divert their goods across the border to Russia, the governments of Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova went along with President Boris N. Yeltsin's sweeping liberalization of consumer prices today.</p>,<p>Ukraine, which had reluctantly planned to raise prices one week after Russia, at the last minute decided to free prices today. Moldova and Belarus followed suit with price increases of their own.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>So far, the radical changes in Moscow have brought little more than added confusion and debt to the Suvorov Collective Farm. But the frozen soil has not exhausted its powers: in one hut, a villager celebrates the first publication of his verse.</p>,<p>It is the heart of winter, and from the road Koltsovo looks at rest. Wisps of wood smoke curl from log houses haphazardly scattered on the white hillsides, calves bellow from a warm and pungent barn, and even the rusting equipment seems less desolate now, half-buried in the snow.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Russia and at least half a dozen other former Soviet republics will most likely join the International Monetary Fund at the group's spring meeting in Washington on April 27, executives at the fund and foreign officials said today.</p>,<p>The officials said the Group of Seven nations and the I.M.F.'s 156 members were still debating how large a share of the bank's capital the republics should supply.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Bush Administration officials said today that the meeting between President Bush and the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, on Saturday had put ties between their nations "on a new plane" and had set the stage for a visit to Moscow this month by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d.</p>,<p>At the same time, they expressed some confusion over biting remarks about foreign support for Russia that Mr. Yeltsin made Saturday evening in Canada, only hours after completing talks with Mr. Bush at Camp David.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi of Russia, bolstering his image as a superpatriot and a vigorous opponent of economic reforms, appeared today before a congress of about 3,000 nationalists and warned that the Russian people were headed for "economic genocide" under the course chosen by the Government and its Western advisers.</p>,<p>In a speech laden with references to Russia's glorious past and what he views as its current incompetence, Mr. Rutskoi positioned himself to take advantage of despair over soaring prices and the hurt pride that many feel over Russia's loss of status.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia challenged and charmed New York's business leaders on Friday night with such a forceful sales pitch for his country that some said later they were more likely to consider ventures in Russia than before.</p>,<p>Guests at a dinner for Mr. Yeltsin at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said the Russian leader scribbled notes furiously throughout the meal, and was disarmingly frank about his own ignorance of the fine points of capitalism.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>It began as a low whisper among aides to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. But as the plane taking them to Moscow at the close of Mr. Baker's grueling tour of former Soviet republics took off, the whispers grew into a vigorous chant: "Penta, Penta, Penta, Penta."</p>,<p>The Penta is the deluxe German-run hotel in Moscow where Mr. Baker always stays. After a week of sleeping often two or three to a room in seedy, run-down former Communist Party guest houses in the wilds of Ashkhabad and Dushanbe, Mr. Baker's aides were desperate for the down comforters, hot water and efficiency of the Penta. It was the first time any of them could recall longing to get to Moscow.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Leading news publications, including some that helped bring down the Soviet dictatorship, are being forced to curtail operations because of skyrocketing printing costs under free-market reforms now being championed philosophically in newspapers.</p>,<p>Muscovites today could not find their daily Komsomolskaya Pravda, which went to alternate-day publication this week because of newsprint costs that have jumped from 300 rubles per ton of paper to 13,000 rubles in the last year. With more than 20 million readers, the newspaper is one of the world's largest.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Beneath the veneer of competence, the Bush Administration's strategy toward the former Soviet Union is a dangerously ineffective response to the greatest democratic awakening and market-opening opportunity of the 20th century. Just as Americans recognize how the Administration has mismanaged the economy, they must now comprehend how its hesitant foreign policy jeopardizes our national security and economic interests.</p>,<p>Boris Yeltsin recently told Congressional leaders that Russia is "in a fight for survival" and had only three months to turn things around. Without more international aid, he said, there would be "an explosion."</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>In a memo circulated privately to his worshipers but meant to bludgeon President Bush publicly, Richard Nixon lays down this warning: If the U.S. doesn't get its act together to save Boris Yeltsin, the question of "Who lost Russia?" will be even more politically devastating in the 90's than "Who lost China?" was in the 50's.</p>,<p>I've got three quarrels with the Old Trickster's latest endeavor to help humankind:</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Proclaiming a state is the easy part. The tricky part, Ukraine is learning, is building one.</p>,<p>One hundred days into independence, the nation is deeply divided over what to do next. Economic reforms are stalled. Friction with Russia is growing. The ersatz national currency has dropped in value from 10 rubles to 1 coupon to parity with the ruble as early illusions about the powers of an independent currency have waned.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Eight weeks into Russia's gamble with economic reform, after prices skyrocketed on everything from kindergartens to airplane tickets, from beef to bricks, most people have learned to cope with the Government's economic "shock therapy" in ways that surprise even them, not to mention the Government and its critics.</p>,<p>It is still too early to judge the success or failure of President Boris N. Yeltsin's policy of crash capitalism. Besides, as the population is reminded almost daily, the worst is probably yet to come. Since Jan. 2, when the price changes went into effect, production in industry and agriculture has dropped sharply across Russia, raising the specter of unemployment and new shortages.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin vigorously defended his Government and economic reforms today before a skeptical Congress of People's Deputies and warned the lawmakers not to short-circuit Russia's transformation by diluting presidential power.</p>,<p>Mr. Yeltsin and his chief economic adviser, Yegor T. Gaidar, gave strongly worded speeches that acknowledged some failures in policy and performance, but said the economy was improving and would stabilize by the end of the year.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>When President Boris N. Yeltsin locks horns with the jealous Russian Congress of People's Deputies next week, the likelihood is that he will prevail. The question is at what price.</p>,<p>The main issues before the 1,000-odd deputies, whose Congress is the highest legislative authority in Russia, will be the progress of economic change, the powers of the government and a new constitution.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Russia's Cabinet withdrew its resignation today after the Congress of Peoples' Deputies passed a muted declaration of support for the course of radical economic reform.</p>,<p>The declaration did not formally undo the resolution approved last Saturday that prompted the resignation in the first place, and a rushed vote left many lawmakers confused about what they were adopting.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>After heated and tangled debate, the Russian Congress of People's Deputies passed a resolution this evening that could curtail some of the powers of President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p>,<p>The Congress voted for an amendment that would require Mr. Yeltsin to give up his concurrent post as Prime Minister within 90 days, and to nominate a new Prime Minister subject to parliamentary approval.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>The International Monetary Fund said today that it had endorsed Russia's economic reform plan, paving the way for Moscow to receive up to $4 billion in I.M.F. aid over the next year.</p>,<p>I.M.F. officials say Russia could begin receiving loans from the fund as early as May, a move that will place the Russian economy to some extent under the stewardship of the I.M.F. It will still require Moscow to meet certain conditions to qualify for the aid, including stringent targets to control the inflation rate and budget deficit.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>On the eve of an important session of the Russian Parliament, President Boris N. Yeltsin demanded strong executive authority in a new constitution today and promised to introduce measures to soften the immediate effects of his economic reforms.</p>,<p>Mr. Yeltsin broke days of public silence, during which he has maneuvered to blunt expected criticism from the Parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies, by shifting some of his closest allies from their posts while defending the need for market reforms and for a strong hand at the top.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>As Russia's top economic official met with them for the first time, finance ministers from the seven largest industrial nations today called on the Russian Government to continue moving boldly ahead with economic reforms.</p>,<p>A day before the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are expected to announce that they have voted to welcome Russia and the other former Soviet republics as members, the ministers pressed the Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Yegor T. Gaidar, for assurances that Moscow would not backtrack on economic reforms under a hostile Parliament's pressure.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>The Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin and the Russian Parliament drew back today from a conflict that had threatened Mr. Yeltsin's program of economic reform.</p>,<p>The confrontation, watched anxiously by the West, was tentatively defused when the Congress of People's Deputies adopted "in principle" a declaration of support for economic reform. The compromise measure, prepared by Government officials and congressional leaders, effectively neutralized the most contentious provisions of a resolution the Congress of deputies adopted on Saturday. Brady Sees 'Steps Backward'</p>,<p>That resolution had prompted Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, the chief architect of the Government's radical reform program, to lead the Cabinet in offering its collective resignation. In a statement made public on Monday, the ministers declared that the Congress's decision would inevitably lead to "a catastrophic decline in living standards, famine, social upheavals and chaos."</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>After nearly 75 years of deliberate isolation, Russia is expected to rejoin the world economy next week, when it should be formally accepted as a member of the International Monetary Fund. This is occurring at a critical time for President Boris N. Yeltsin, who must make some politically difficult decisions to keep his vaunted economic reform moving.</p>,<p>Without these decisions -- primarily to restructure the bulky industrial economy and thereby bring about the inevitable displacement of thousands of workers -- the reform could fail to go far enough to get the billions of dollars of aid being prepared by the I.M.F. and Western nations. Russian leaders know that to receive the much needed Western aid, they will have to submit to I.M.F. discipline and tighten the collective economic belt ever tighter. Credit Is Expanded</p>,<p>But already some serious signs of slippage have occurred in Mr. Yeltsin's program of economic reform. Aware that the sudden rise of prices without a similar rise in income has led to widespread grumbling, the Russian Government in recent weeks has begun to loosen up on its tight-money policy.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin's crash program of economic reform took a drubbing today from critics in the Congress of People's Deputies, with one lawmaker comparing the Yeltsin Government to a Greek in the fourth century B.C. who burned down a temple to make his name immortal.</p>,<p>"Our Government will go down in history all right, as the Herostratos who finally wrecked the economy of a great country," said Mikhail Chelnakov, one in a string of legislators who lined up to deliver their verdicts on the four-month-old program.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>The Russian aid package announced last week by the Bush Administration and some Western allies is less concrete and less complete than many officials made it seem, interviews with Administration officials, American lawmakers and senior officials in Europe, Japan and Canada indicate.</p>,<p>The officials said eagerness to show support for President Boris N. Yeltsin before his crucial encounter with the Russian Parliament this week accounted for the hasty announcement.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Seeking billions of dollars to heal its economic ills, Russia presented a smooth young face to the West today, a 36-year-old Deputy Prime Minister full of enthusiasm for free markets.</p>,<p>In his gray suit, light blue shirt and dark tie, Yegor T. Gaidar could have passed for a bureaucrat of any Western European government. With his unwrinkled cheeks and detailed descriptions of how to sell state-owned industries, he offered a clear-cut contrast to his boss, President Boris N. Yeltsin, a rough and bluff politician of an age to be his father.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank formally offered membership today to Russia, Ukraine and most of the other former Soviet republics. It was a major step to tie the republics into the rest of the world's economy.</p>,<p>Western and Russian officials said offering membership would also help make billions of dollars of Monetary Fund and World Bank aid available to the republics as they emerge from seven decades of Communism and make the painful transition to market economies.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin's entire Cabinet formally offered to resign today unless an unexpectedly aggressive Parliament halted efforts to scale back the Government's program of economic reform.</p>,<p>Any such dilution of the Russian President's program could lead the West to reconsider its offer of billions of dollars in assistance and jeopardize Mr. Yeltsin's plans for economic recovery.</p>,<p>Yegor T. Gaidar, the Deputy Prime Minister and chief architect of the economic reforms, said the Cabinet had submitted its resignation en masse, reflecting a growing power struggle between Mr. Yeltsin and the Congress of People's Deputies, the highest legislative authority in Russia.  Keep Working, Yeltsin Says</p>,<p>Mr. Gaidar said Mr. Yeltsin had asked his ministers to continue working until the end of the Congress session in the next few days, when he will decide whether to accept their resignations.</p>,<p>Their action was in protest against a resolution adopted by the Congress on Saturday ordering Mr. Yeltsin to relinquish the post of Prime Minister and to name a new Government within three months, as well as to make broad changes in the economic program, which came under sharp criticism.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>The International Monetary Fund complimented the Ukrainian Government today for "its stated commitment to a market economy," but the fund's statement fell short of the endorsement it issued last week of Russia's fast-paced reform program.</p>,<p>Over the past week, the I.M.F.'s executive board has been reviewing the economic liberalization programs of the former Soviet republics in preparation for their joining the fund around the time of its meeting on April 27.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>The Russian Government's moves to slacken its tough economic reforms and hints by free-market advocates that they might resign could delay the flow of Western aid to Russia and the creation of a ruble stabilization fund, economists say.</p>,<p>The $24 billion aid package announced by President Bush just before the current meeting of the Congress of People's Deputies in Moscow was intended to help President Boris N. Yeltsin press ahead with changes, but his backtracking last week, caused largely by pressures from the hostile legislature, could delay important pieces of the package.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Russian Government and congress officials spent the day today in secretive huddles, seeking ways to retreat from the confrontation that took shape on Saturday when the country's highest elected council adopted a resolution limiting President Boris N. Yeltsin's right to name his officials.</p>,<p>After a meeting between senior members of Mr. Yeltsin's Government and the Presidium of the Congress of People's Deputies, the two sides said in a statement that "as a result of constructive discussions, it became possible to narrow the positions and to agree on cooperation in advancing radical economic reform."</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>In his five days of meetings here, Yegor T. Gaidar, Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister, sketched a sweeping yet detailed vision of Russia's economic future, including plans to make the ruble convertible by July 1 and to speed up privatization.</p>,<p>Mr. Gaidar, who is chief architect of Russia's economic reforms, said he would put an emphasis on increasing oil and agricultural production.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Every morning about 10, Lyuda Averyanova takes up her spot in the middle of the crush on Stoleshnikov Lane, now the hottest street bazaar in a city seized by consumer frenzy, and starts selling bottles of German blond hair dye.</p>,<p>To her right, a woman sells Russian-made sweat suits for 500 rubles; to the left, other women offer Christian Dior moisturizer for 1,000 rubles and Spanish faucets for 3,500 rubles.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia signed a resolution today raising the prices for oil and gas more than fivefold, a long-awaited move that is expected to send new shock waves through the fragile Russian economy.</p>,<p>Although wholesale prices for oil and natural gas will remain low by world standards, many economists fear that the increases will batter the nation's farms, factories and transportation. The price of oil is rising from 48 cents to between $2.47 and $3.01 a barrel, compared with about $20 on world markets.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>SCIENTISTS at Russia's five stations in Antarctica say they have stopped sending data home to protest the difficulties their families face in Russia.</p>,<p>In a statement signed by Dr. Vladimir Nazarov, leader of the Vostok station, the Russians cited their nation's severe inflation and said: "The miserable salary of Russian polar explorers, working in the rigorous climate of Antarctica, is hardly enough for our families even to buy food. We cannot help them. We can only send moral support by telephone."</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>It is a year now since Boris N. Yeltsin became the first elected President of Russia, and the reviews are as diverse as the extraordinary chain of events that transformed him from the maverick leader of a Soviet republic to the master of the Kremlin.</p>,<p>Though he travels widely and gives frequent interviews, the burly, 61-year-old President remains a complex and elusive figure. He is still enormously popular at home, but abroad his stiff and formal demeanor have denied him the celebrity status enjoyed by his archrival, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  In Wake of Gorbachev</p>,<p>That contrast is certain to hang over Mr. Yeltsin's visit to the United States starting Monday, which comes in the wake of Mr. Gorbachev's successful voyage. The trip is Mr. Yeltsin's second to the United States as Russia's President and his first full-dress summit meeting, and he will have the rare honor of addressing a joint meeting of Congress.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Although the biggest news out of this week's summit meeting was the agreement to sharply reduce American and Russian nuclear arsenals, the centerpiece turned out to be economic relations between the two former rivals.</p>,<p>In effect, these two days marked the moment when the currency of American-Russian relations shifted from warheads to dollars. Stripped to its essence, what President Boris N. Yeltsin did this week was promise Mr. Bush that Russia would trash thousands of warheads in exchange for long-promised trade privileges, a bilateral investment treaty, removal of cold-war trade barriers and the hope of lucrative American investment and quick Congressional approval of a Russian aid package.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>On a day that the United States gave Russia a set of trade incentives to boost its struggling economy, President Boris N. Yeltsin swept through official Washington like a conquering hero today and announced that he was deactivating the most potent nuclear missiles aimed at America.</p>,<p>Amid chants of "Boris, Boris, Boris!" reverberating through the House of Representatives chamber, Mr. Yeltsin stirred Congress to 13 standing ovations as he vowed that the "idol of Communism" had "collapsed, never to rise again."  [ Excerpts, page A18. ]</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>A decision by Russia to pay Government workers by printing more money, coupled with a shuffling of ministers, has brought sharp domestic questioning about President Boris N. Yeltsin's commitment to austerity measures in the transition to a market economy.</p>,<p>The recent Russian moves have also generated concerns at the International Monetary Fund, according to international monetary officials. They said that an I.M.F. team had just returned to the fund's headquarters in Washington from a visit to Moscow and was evaluating the latest Yeltsin Government actions.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>In a move to speed aid to Moscow, the International Monetary Fund plans to lend the Russians $1 billion to help pay for crucial imports in a simplified reform agreement that the agency hopes to complete in the next two weeks.</p>,<p>The I.M.F.'s plan, as described by its officials, represented a scaling back of original plans for a multibillion-dollar package requiring more sweeping reforms by the Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Administration officials said today that they would press President Boris N. Yeltsin to bring Russia's budget deficit under control to help enable Moscow to sign an economic reform agreement with the International Monetary Fund.</p>,<p>If Russia controls its deficit, reins in its money supply and moves to make the ruble convertible, then the Administration will press the I.M.F. not to delay an agreement because of concerns about details, the officials added.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Eleven nations of the Balkan Peninsula and the former Soviet Union joined today in a group for economic cooperation.</p>,<p>In a solemn ceremony, Presidents Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine, Eduard A. Shevardnadze of Georgia and Prime Ministers Suleyman Demirel of Turkey and Constantine Mitsotakis of Greece signed the Declaration of Black Sea Economic Cooperation.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>The introduction of a tough troika of former Soviet industrial managers into Boris N. Yeltsin's Government in the past two weeks has stirred a new round of speculation about the Russian President's true intentions.</p>,<p>Mr. Yeltsin has argued that the managers, all with solid track records both in industry and in reform politics, were needed to bring a critical economic sector into the Government as it moves toward the complex next stage of privatization and conversion.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>A backlash against President Boris N. Yeltsin's economic reforms is forcing a delay of several months, and perhaps much longer, in the approval of an aid package intended to give Russia at least $24 billion in Western assistance, Russian and American officials say.</p>,<p>The delay comes as there are strong signs in Washington that Congress has lost its enthusiasm for giving money to Russia to help finance the International Monetary Fund package that is threatened by the Moscow backlash.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>The first of July has been billed as the dawn of an ambitious second stage of Russia's economic reform, including, most importantly, a single floating exchange rate for the battered ruble.</p>,<p>The changes are important for the Government and for business, but for most individual Russians, they will mean still higher prices for the goods they buy.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>The Zverev family is getting by in the new Russia, thank you very much. It's not easy, and the Zverevs get grumpy about the contradictions of the present, which is full of confusion, and nervous about the future -- about whether Russia's bet on the West, on democracy and a market economy is going to pay off.</p>,<p>But they are managing, finding ways not just to make more money, but to make their lives more rewarding. And the manner in which they have coped with the radical changes in Russian economic life -- far higher prices, but also more possibilities for the even modestly clever -- is a testament to the survival of initiative and entrepreneurship under Soviet Communism.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>The Russian Government and the International Monetary Fund announced today that they had reached a lending agreement that gives President Boris N. Yeltsin the endorsement he had sought from the West for his economic policies, but also commits him to cut back on Government spending just when the deficit is rising sharply.</p>,<p>The I.M.F. had been under pressure for weeks from the Bush Administration to soften its usual requirements so that an agreement with the Yeltsin Government could be announced before a meeting of leaders of the seven industrial powers that begins in Munich on Monday. Mr. Yeltsin is to join President Bush and the other leaders in Munich on Wednesday.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>The economic summit meetings of the seven industrial democracies, begun 17 years ago in France, are facing a crisis of credibility. With all the talk, pomp and expense, accompanied this year by scant action, people are asking: Where's the beef?</p>,<p>The nearest thing, it seemed, was President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia. In an unusual twist, the head of an economy in virtually complete chaos, with an "inflation rate" of 640 percent in the past four months, was welcomed today by the Group of Seven as a potential savior.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>As Russia's ruble began its precarious journey toward being a normal, convertible currency, acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar warned the Russian Parliament today that the Government budget deficit was running out of control.</p>,<p>"We have begun to allow ourselves to spend more than we can afford," Mr. Gaidar said, cautioning legislators that there could be no stability for the newly floated ruble if the deficit continued to grow, further fueling inflation.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>The 64,000 steelworkers at the Magnitogorsk Metallurgical Complex, the world's largest steelworks, are beginning to get nervous. The company is 90 days behind in paying wages and is offering instead 50-pound sacks of sugar and pieces of steel that the workers can try to resell.</p>,<p>As production falls, 5,000 of the workers do not have a full day's work and some have been sent home on forced vacations.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>With the House apparently ready to approve a Russian-aid package but delaying the politically sensitive vote until leaders can assemble a healthy bipartisan majority, Ambassador Robert S. Strauss is back from Moscow to work the Hill.</p>,<p>Demonstrating that he is still a consummate Washington insider, he is cajoling House members, posing for pictures with their aides, slapping lobbyists on the back, and cursing reporters in good- humored fashion, asking them to help him persuade Congress that the security of the United States could be at stake.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Russia will ask the major industrial nations at their summit meeting in Munich for a two-year moratorium on repayments of principal and interest on the former Soviet debt, President Boris N. Yeltsin said today.</p>,<p>The industrial nations, known as the G-7, for Group of 7, will meet in Munich starting Monday and have already discussed extending an existing nine-month moratorium, though September, on repayments of principal, as well as longer-term debt relief, as long as Russia's economic reforms continue.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>No one family, however extended, can possibly represent the full domestic drama of Russia's experiment in finding a new way to live.</p>,<p>But the Zverev family, who were willing to sit through many hours of interviews about their lives and expectations, give a reasonable picture of the way Russians are getting by in this complicated transition between totalitarian Communism and a democratic market economy, when inflation is surging and the mind struggles with old habits and new possibilities.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>The Senate approved today a long-delayed aid package to the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe that authorizes nearly $1 billion in new spending and billions of dollars in credits and loans, all conditioned on continued movement toward democracy and a free market.</p>,<p>By a 76-to-20 vote, the Senate passed a bill that supporters said established a new framework for friendly relations between Washington and its former cold-war foes. The House is expected to take up a similar package later this month.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>The leaders of seven major industrial democracies promised a "comprehensive partnership" with Russia and $1 billion in new aid to Moscow today. But in a meeting with the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, they signaled that the formerly Communist countries of Eastern Europe and the old Soviet Union should expect no further injections of aid until they restructured their economies.</p>,<p>In a communique issued today at the end of their three-day economic summit meeting, the seven leaders said future aid to the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe "will be tailored to their reform progress and internationally responsible behavior, including further reductions in military spending and fulfillment of obligations already undertaken."</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Boris N. Yeltsin's journey to Munich was familiar: the preliminary vow that he would not "get on his knees" before the West, an encouraging pat from leaders of the rich world, a handful of change and promises of far more once he really got moving on reforms.</p>,<p>Mikhail S. Gorbachev had made the same pilgrimage a year earlier, when the Group of Seven met in London, and Mr. Yeltsin had recently returned from much the same sort of thing in Washington at a meeting with President Bush.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>A plan from the new chairman of the Russian Central Bank to reduce the enormous debt burden carried by state industries has deepened the dispute inside the Government over how sharply to curb deficit spending.</p>,<p>The plan, proposed last week by the chairman, Viktor Gerashchenko, was reportedly the subject of a heated discussion today by top economic officials, the news agency Interfax said.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Twice before in this century, America was summoned to international leadership. After World War I, we ignored the summons, and we and the world paid dearly. After World War II, wiser from experience with depression and dictatorship, we heeded the call to leadership and created the democratic coalition that won the cold war. Today, America is summoned again, this time to secure a democratic peace with Russia, Ukraine and the other new independent states of the former Soviet Union.</p>,<p>As President Bush said, "Democrats in the Kremlin can assure our security in a way nuclear missiles never could." The House of Representatives, by passing the Freedom Support Act, can help those democrats -- and help America, too.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Arkady I. Volsky has the superficial slickness of a man long accustomed to deference. In his huge office in the old Communist Party's Central Committee headquarters, with all the requisite attendants and the long line of supplicants in the corridor, Mr. Volsky acts as if he has all the time in the world.</p>,<p>These days in Russia, it's almost true. Power seems to flow toward Mr. Volsky on an increasingly steep slope built on the chaos of Russia's economy and the inevitable mistakes of the largely theoretical economists around acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, who is the architect of Russia's stumbling reform.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Eleven months after the failed Communist coup and seven months after the breakup of the Soviet Union, President Boris N. Yeltsin's reformist Government is in retreat and its radical economic plan is faltering.</p>,<p>There is a growing sense that the administration of Acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, who designed Russia's economic reform plan, miscalculated its plans and has lost its authority and bearings. Indications are that the radical reformers are rapidly losing ground to tough directors and managers of state-owned industries who demand a far slower pace of change.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>After a year of political and economic turmoil, Russians have become accustomed to watching things fall apart. But the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Communist Party and other institutions that once controlled their lives did not prepare them for the last and perhaps most painful shock: a breakdown in the trust and discipline that bound their society together.</p>,<p>It is not just a matter of crime, corruption, prostitution, smuggling, and drug and alcohol abuse, although there is plenty of evidence that these are on the rise. There is also a widespread view that now, as Russia goes through another historic convulsion, people are out for themselves and anything goes.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>On the eve of celebrations for the anniversary of last year's failed coup d'etat, President Boris N. Yeltsin went on television tonight with details of a privatization program that will provide vouchers worth 10,000 rubles (just over $60) for each man, woman and child in Russia.</p>,<p>Mr. Yeltsin, back from a two-week vacation, gave a somber, even defensive assessment of his economic reforms. "Some people say we plunged into the stream before learning to swim," he said. "But we have not choked, nor have we drowned."</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>For seven decades this ancient city, renamed Gorky by the Bolsheviks, led the Soviet Union in making weapons of destruction. Now a new breed of bold leaders hopes that as Nizhny Novgorod once again the city can lead Russia -- this time, into a new phase of economic reform.</p>,<p>From offices in the medieval citadel, a brash young Governor, a Mayor who used to fight white-collar crime and a crusading economist, backed by some imported Western talent, are plotting an ambitious and independent economic path that they believe could provide a model for the stalled reforms of Moscow, 250 miles to the west.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Yegor T. Gaidar, the Acting Prime Minister of Russia, insists that the Government's economic program is still on track, despite mounting pressures from a powerful industrial lobby that has raised alarms among members of Parliament and the press who support the changes.</p>,<p>The 36-year-old economist said in an interview today that while compromises have been made with the industrial sector since the program began in January, these compromises have so far not undercut the targets on inflation and deficit spending agreed upon earlier this summer with the International Monetary Fund.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>After 45 years of voting for foreign aid to combat the Soviet Union, the House voted today to provide billions of dollars in assistance to Russia and the other former Soviet republics.</p>,<p>The action assures Congressional approval of an aid package that President Bush has called essential to the post-cold-war world and that President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia told Congress in June would help guarantee the success of his efforts to nourish democratic and economic reform.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>On the sandy shores of the Gulf of Finland, where it curves above St. Petersburg, lies a pristine swatch of pine and birch forests that somehow managed to escape Soviet development.</p>,<p>Vyacheslav Kozyritsky, the 41-year-old Mayor of Zelenogorsk, wants to change all that. Where generations of Russian writers, artists and Communist bosses saw unspoiled nature, he sees opportunity -- for hotels, shopping centers, business parks, single-family housing, garden apartments, in short, a "New Petersburg" on a scale that would shock even the most ambitious American developer.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Putting the uproar over his sudden cancellation of a trip to Japan behind him, President Boris N. Yeltsin thrust himself into the center of domestic politics today with a strong warning about the dangers threatening his economic program.</p>,<p>At a conference of local officials in the Volga River city of Cheboksary, Mr. Yeltsin denounced what he said were policies of "cheap credits and unrealistic social programs" pushing the Russian economy toward an abyss.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>As the Soviet welfare system collapses, the feminization of poverty may become the new Russia's largest and cruelest problem.</p>,<p>In Moscow, 70 percent of the newly unemployed are women between the ages of 45 and 55. When I visited one of Moscow's recently established unemployment offices this summer, women in line described the kind of discrimination they now face in the job market. Some were turned away because they were too old -- in their 40's. Others had been told that their maternal responsibilities made them unreliable workers.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>President Bush's new world order, which assigns leadership to the United States as the surviving superpower, clearly did not apply this week to the European currency turmoil. While the United States Government stood by, Germany marched Europe to the German agenda.</p>,<p>Similarly, Mr. Bush's call last spring for rapid approval of foreign loans for Russia was not repeated by the Administration this week at the semiannual gathering of the world's finance ministers and central bank presidents -- a meeting that is frequently a platform from which to push America's foreign economic goals. The White House was silent on Russia.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin's chief economic planner opened a new round of grappling with the hostile Parliament today with a warning that unless his spartan monetary policies were restored, the Russian monetary system faced a "complete crash."</p>,<p>The warning by Yegor T. Gaidar, the embattled Acting Prime Minister, served notice that he did not intend to let his economic course be torpedoed by a torrent of new credits issued by the new director of the Central Bank, Viktor Gerashchenko, who was appointed in June by the Parliament.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>As summer draws to an end and Russians drift back to work after a month of backyard farming at their country cottages, the economy is showing signs of a looming price explosion that some experts predict could double the inflation rate by mid-autumn.</p>,<p>A tumble in the value of the ruble, which fell 25 percent against the dollar at restricted currency auctions over the last week, is just one sign of the wide perception that prices are about to soar again after a summer lull.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Ask about the "free market" or "reform," and people out on these fertile South Russian plains still begin to snarl.</p>,<p>But ask about the price of wheat or the cost of fuel, and the animated patter tells a different story. A year after the Government began to wean agriculture from the hugely inefficient Soviet system, some tender new shoots of market are appearing in the hardened old collective farms, the kolkhozes.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>If dragging Russia into the high-tech consumer age has proved harder than anyone suspected, don't blame the language. Since the dawn of the Age of Perestroika, the jargon of American business and electronics has been eagerly welcomed in Russia, from the entry-level</p>,<p>biznes</p>,<p>and</p>,<p>kompyutery</p>,<p>through</p>,<p>griny</p>,<p>, or</p>,<p>buksy</p>,<p>(dollars),</p>,<p>press rilis</p>,<p>and</p>,<p>imidzh</p>,<p>(image).</p>,<p>One reason is that unlike the Russian character, which is traditionally resistant to innovation, the Russian language, with its plethora of prefixes and endings, is eminently suited to adopt and shape verbal imports. Tack on a syllable at the front or back, change a thing here or there, and a new arrival takes on forms even its parents would not recognize. Xerox, for example, keenly sensitive to the misuse of its familiar trade name as a common verb, might easily overlook the rise of</p>,<p>otserit</p>,<p>-- a Russian evolution of</p>,<p>ot-kseroks-iro</p>,<p>vat</p>,<p>(to make a Xerox).</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Confused by the loss of an empire and frustrated by an inflation rate that keeps emptying their pockets, many Russians have fixed their fear and anxiety on a convenient target: traders from the Caucasus who have virtually taken over the farmers markets in Moscow and other cities, offering a tantalizing array of roses, lemons, bananas, bootlegged caviar, eggplant, Bulgarian chickens and other goods at prices beyond the average shopper's reach.</p>,<p>More and more, people mutter darkly of an invasion by "blacks." The term is used loosely here to describe the dark-haired southerners who until recently were described on police blotters as "people of a Caucasian nationality." They include Azerbaijanis, Armenians and Georgians, but also people from Dagestan, Chechenya and other autonomous republics within Russia.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>President Boris N. Yeltsin and his Prime Minister separately defended their economic program before the Russian Parliament today, but with variations that spoke of the struggle now being waged over the further course of reform.</p>,<p>Mr. Yeltsin, addressing the fall session of the legislature, acknowledged "serious errors" in economic management and assailed three members of his Cabinet by name -- Andrei A. Nechayev, the economics minister; Pyotr O. Aven, minister for foreign economic relations, and Aleksandr A. Titkin, minister for industry.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Ever since Czar Aleksandr II sold Alaska to the Americans, Kamchatka has been Russia's easternmost frontier -- a peninsula roughly the size of Montana, with snow-tipped volcanoes, sputtering geysers and miles of untouched birch forests that turn amber in the fading light of autumn.</p>,<p>Here, nine time zones away from Moscow, nature is still undefeated, in contrast to the rest of Russia, where the environment was regularly sacrificed to the reckless god of industrial development. On Kamchatka, the rivers are still clean enough for freshwater crayfish and spawning salmon, while in winter the snow in its volcanic craters is so white that local people describe it as almost blue.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>In an atmosphere of mounting political confrontation, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia called today for the disbanding of the National Salvation Front, an opposition group made up of ultra-nationalists and old-guard Communists that held its founding congress last weekend.</p>,<p>At a meeting with top officials of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Mr. Yeltsin said the front was both unconstitutional and politically destabilizing, and declared its activities "inadmissable."</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Campaigning for his embattled reforms two weeks before a crucial session of the Russian legislature, President Boris N. Yeltsin lashed out today at the political forces ranged against him.</p>,<p>"Of late, there has been an unbridled campaign in the country to fire political hysteria," Mr. Yeltsin said before the powerful lobby of industrial managers.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Until this year, the diamonds mined here at the giant Peace pit, dug a quarter-mile deep into the harsh Siberian landscape, have been more a source of misery than of wealth for the residents of Yakutia, the largest and arguably the richest of Russia's autonomous regions.</p>,<p>Yakutia's diamonds, which account for 99 percent of Russia's production and one-fourth of the world's, were discovered here in 1957. But Mirny, the hub of the diamond industry, started to pave its roads only five years ago, and still has 40 percent of them to go. Despite winter temperatures of 40 degrees below zero, many residents still live in wooden huts where, as one inhabitant put it, all the facilities are outside except the beds, and the only running water comes in spring when the snow melts.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>The Peace Corps is sending its first volunteers to Russia this week. On Friday, 102 business executives and graduates of business schools will arrive in Moscow for three months of language training before being assigned to small business centers throughout Russia.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Like a general rallying his troops on the eve of battle, President Boris N. Yeltsin told his supporters today that the reforms he had introduced were "the main cause of my entire life" and that he would remain committed to those policies, "whatever turn things may take."</p>,<p>On the other side of the city, outside the gates to Gorky Park, several hundred die-hard Communists braved arctic temperatures at a rally of their own, waving red flags and a banner that reduced the approaching clash to its bare bones: "Lenin Yes! Yeltsin No!"</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>LOOKING LIKE POOH Bear in the lions' den, Yegor Timurovich Gaidar, the Acting Prime Minister of Russia, strode to the podium to face his harshest audience, the Supreme Soviet, the standing Parliament chosen 21 months before the Soviet Union collapsed.</p>,<p>Gaidar, only 36 years old, was sweating, clearly nervous. The Parliament had come back into session this day, Sept. 22, after a summer of increasingly bitter denunciations of Gaidar and his Government, which is dominated by young, westernized economists like himself.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>A year ago, the stories out of Moscow were full of dark warnings about starvation, destitution, chaos and coups as the Soviet Union lurched toward its end.</p>,<p>This has not been a wonderful year for the Russian economy, as an inexperienced Government tries to manage an extraordinary transition to a capitalistic system. There is more poverty, purchasing power is down, industrial production has dropped to 75 percent of what it was a year ago, inflation is running at about 25 percent a month and the ruble is hovering around 450 to the dollar, compared with 135 at the end of June.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>When Robert S. Strauss arrived here to take up his post as the United States Ambassador, there was a coup going on, so on the drive in from the airport he settled back for a nap. "There won't be much time to sleep later on," he explained to his surprised wife.</p>,<p>Leaving Moscow a tempestuous 15 months later, Mr. Strauss said he was still not sure when there would be rest. But he said he was convinced that if Russia could hang tough through an additional 18 to 24 months without an explosion, the country's economic crisis would begin to lift.</p>

economic conditions and trends	<p>Having set off a storm of criticism by dismissing the outspoken chief of central television, President Boris N. Yeltsin took another step today toward appeasing his opposition by accepting the resignation of his pugnacious Information Minister.</p>,<p>Coming only days before an important session of Russia's legislature, Mr. Yeltsin's sudden dismissal of two men known for their support of openness in the press suggested to many today that he was so deeply committed to working out a compromise with the conservative legislators to achieve qualified support of his economic reform plan that he was willing to appear less than dedicated to an independent press and television.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>The Russian legislature today called on Acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar to amend his latest economic program, thus delivering a last-minute rebuke to the Government as it prepares for next week's gathering of the Congress of People's Deputies.</p>,<p>The Parliament's overwhelming vote, 135 to 14, reflected dissatisfaction with a report given by Mr. Gaidar on Thursday, which some members of the centrist opposition saw as a betrayal of a joint effort to coordinate economic policies on the eve of the Congress.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Looking to win a firm show of Western backing, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia swept through London today, signing a flurry of broad agreements on economic and political cooperation with Britain and then making a fresh appeal to the West to do more to ease his country's crippling burden of debt.</p>,<p>Closing the first day of a two-day visit, Mr. Yeltsin told a group of London bankers and business people that if Moscow is to find a way out of its cash crisis, money borrowed by the Soviet Union in its last 11 months of existence must be included in any debt-rescheduling plan.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>A few days after Lithuania's former Communists surged ahead in the first round of elections for a new parliament, pranksters put up a mock Lenin statue, made of cardboard with Russian rubles pinned on its chest, in what used to be Lenin Square.</p>,<p>The figure draw a crowd of agitated citizens ready to dissect the elections on Oct. 25 for signs that Lithuania, once again, is setting a trend.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Lithuanian voters angry at economic difficulties and cold apartments have repudiated the Sajudis movement that brought them independence, giving a party of former Communists a working majority in a new Parliament.</p>,<p>After a stinging defeat on Sunday in a second, runoff round of elections for Parliament, the bitter leader of the defeated party, Vytautas Landsbergis, who announced independence in March 1990, warned that "we are moving back toward the one-party rule we saw before 1988."</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Saying he needed to "restore order" and protect the reformist core of Russia's Government, President Boris N. Yeltsin cut short his visit to China this morning and headed back to Moscow.</p>,<p>His new Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, whom Mr. Yeltsin chose this week after parliamentary pressure forced him to abandon acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, was on his own visit to Kazakhstan, and Moscow itself seemed quiet early this morning.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>A year after the end of the Soviet Union, anything goes in Moscow.</p>,<p>In front of the "Artistic Salon" on Dimitrova Street, where paintings and other works of art are offered for sale in three large rooms with huge picture windows visible to all passersby, signs "categorically" forbid the freelance sale of art or artistic materials outside, by order of the Moscow City Council.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Large-scale foreign economic and financial aid to Russia, which many economists still believe is essential for a transformation to a market economy, has been pushed off the international agenda by political uncertainties here and by a global recession that affects potential donors.</p>,<p>The political struggle in Russia between pro-market forces, led by President Boris N. Yeltsin, and legislators who resist the painful aspects of change leaves many Western investors and diplomats skeptical about investing large amounts.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Despite a series of recent setbacks for President Boris N. Yeltsin's drive to establish a market economy in Russia, many Western economists and experts say that the transition is likely to continue, at a slower pace, and that the process may be too far along to be reversed.</p>,<p>In a dozen interviews, experts on Russia as well as officials who deal with Russia in the United States Government, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank said they were disappointed that Mr. Yeltsin had been thwarted in his efforts. But they said they no longer feared that the Yeltsin reforms were in danger of being undone.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>With his job on the line and his program under attack, Acting Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar told a hostile legislature today that the country must stop inflation and runaway spending, or face the fate of the underdeveloped third world.</p>,<p>Mr. Gaidar, whose policies for economic change are the focus of the Congress of People's Deputies, gave little ground to critics, whom he accused of indulging in "the economics of populism" and of ignoring the dangers of an inflation rate that is now 25 percent a month.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Looking down into the abyss of hyperinflation a condition that bred totalitarianism in Germany -- Russian leaders, old and new, are now deciding which economic model to follow.</p>,<p>One model is Western-style capitalism that couples political democracy with free markets. The Poles and Czechs, having accepted the hardship of such "shock therapy," are making this dual freedom work.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Outmaneuvered in the end by the hostile Russian Congress, President Boris N. Yeltsin today surrendered Yegor T. Gaidar, the architect and symbol of his economic program, and in his stead named a veteran manager of the state energy sector to be Prime Minister.</p>,<p>The stunning reversal, and the question mark it raised over the continuation of the already limping program of economic change, concluded a two-week power struggle between Mr. Yeltsin and the bellicose Congress of People's Deputies, during which the tide of battle shifted frequently and furiously.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, Russia's new Prime Minister, has had a long and successful career as a manager and Cabinet minister in charge of the country's huge gas and energy complex.</p>,<p>What was striking today was how few of the legislators who voted for him know very much about him. But many said they knew the type: a strong, experienced administrator who ran a vital industry with wide international contacts, but who was no Communist Party hack.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>When the former Communist countries of the old Soviet bloc seek advice on capitalism, they look not just to financial centers like New York and Chicago. More and more, former Soviet republics and other Eastern European countries are turning to smaller post-industrial American cities, like Baltimore and Pittsburgh, for economic advice and intellectual exchange.</p>,<p>"Old industrial societies of the West have faced the same environmental and economic problems Russia now faces," said Blair A. Ruble, director of the Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies in Washington. "Russians see difficulties and need desperately to talk to people who have faced these issues on a similar scale."</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>By a hair's breadth, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia today survived the most serious challenge yet mounted by hard-line opponents in Parliament intent on altering the course of his economic changes and curbing his powers.</p>,<p>In secret balloting, the country's highest-ranking legislative body fell a few votes short of adopting constitutional amendments that would have diluted Mr. Yeltsin's control over the Government and given new powers to a Parliament dominated by an increasingly militant majority of hard-liners.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>From the political turmoil in Russia in recent days, two men have emerged with enhanced influence: Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the new and relatively unknown Prime Minister, who has spent most of his life in the oil and gas industry, and Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, who has burst from obscurity to make his job of Speaker of the legislature into a new power center.</p>,<p>In separate news conferences today, both appealed for calm and consensus, but in radically different tones.</p>
economic conditions and trends	<p>At 4 P.M., as the winter sky darkens, thousands of traders from the giant flea-market at the Luzhniki Sports Stadium here trudge homeward through the dirt and slush, lugging bags and suitcases stuffed with unsold goods.</p>,<p>For many Russians today, this is the "market" that the politicians have been talking about in the Kremlin for all these weeks. It is not a free exchange of goods and services, it is not checking accounts or credit cards, or even unemployment benefits and unpaid bills. It is standing in the cold for hours on end, holding up cheap cosmetics, or sweaters imported from Turkey, or the odd pair of boots or shoes, waiting for someone to come and buy.</p>
